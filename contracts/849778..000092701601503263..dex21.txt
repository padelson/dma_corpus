assumption that those shares represent the aggregate number of shares of PRO
DUCT Common Stock into which they would be convertible immediately prior to the
Effective Time at the then applicable Conversion Price, as defined in the PRO
DUCT Certificate of Incorporation for each such series), and the Total Common
Shares, in equal amounts on a per share of PRO DUCT Common Stock basis (subject

and the remainder shall consist of cash; and

Common Shares in an equal amount per Total Common Share. A portion of the
Consideration so allocated to each share computed by multiplying the amount of
Consideration so allocated by the Stock Ratio shall consist of CYTYC Common
Stock (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000/th/ of a share) and the remainder shall
consist of cash.

Stockholders pursuant to Section 2.2.1 that is allocable to the Total Common
Shares pursuant to Section 2.2.1(d) after payment of the Escrow Cash into the
Escrow Account (the "Stockholder Representative Escrow Amount") shall be
                     ----------------------------------------
delivered by CYTYC to the Stockholder Representative at the Effective Time.  The
Stockholder Representative shall hold the Stockholder Representative Escrow
Amount in escrow in an interest-bearing account on behalf of the Stockholders
for use in paying any expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in
connection with the performance of the Stockholder Representative's actions
hereunder.  For tax reporting purposes all interest earned from investment of
the Stockholder Representative Escrow Amount shall be allocated to the
Stockholders named on the Stockholder Information Schedule, pro rata in
accordance with their respective ownership percentages.  After the Stockholder
Representative has fully performed all actions to be performed by it hereunder,
the Stockholder Representative shall deliver the remainder of the Stockholder
Representative Escrow Amount, if any, together with any accrued interest
thereon, if any, to the Stockholders named on the Stockholder Information
Schedule, pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership percentages, at
their respective addresses set forth on the Stockholder Information Schedule.

         (d)   Dissenting Shares.  The Stockholder Representative shall update
               -----------------
the Stockholder Information Schedule from time to time to reflect the proper
exercise, in accordance with Section 2.7 hereof, of dissenters' rights.  The
Stockholder Representative shall promptly deliver such updated Stockholder
Information Schedule to CYTYC, together with a calculation of the number of
Escrow Shares and the amount of Escrow Cash that represent Dissenting Shares if
any Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash shall be held by the Escrow Agent with respect
to any such Dissenting Shares.  Once CYTYC and the Stockholder Representative
shall have agreed upon such number of Dissenting Shares, CYTYC shall deliver
written notice thereof to the Escrow Agent, following which the Escrow Agent
shall deliver certificates representing the number of Escrow Shares and cash in
the amount of the Escrow Cash, in each case held in respect of such Dissenting
Shares, in accordance with the procedures set forth herein, to CYTYC.

               2.2.3    PRO DUCT Stock.   From and after the Effective Time, all
                        --------------
shares of PRO DUCT Common Stock and PRO DUCT Preferred Stock shall no longer be

                                       11
<PAGE>

outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and each
certificate (a "PRO DUCT Certificate") formerly representing any such shares
                --------------------
(other than Dissenting Shares as defined in Section 2.7) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.2
and the right, if any, to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares set forth in
Section 2.3 and any distribution or dividend pursuant to Section 2.9. Any shares
of the capital stock of PRO DUCT that are held in treasury at the Closing shall
be cancelled at the Effective Time without payment of any consideration
therefor.

     Section 2.3   Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other
                   ---------------------------------
provision of this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of CYTYC Common Stock shall be issued as consideration to any Stockholder
in the Merger or pursuant to the exercise of Converted Options pursuant to
Section 5.6 hereof, no dividend or other distribution of CYTYC shall relate to
any fractional share and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of CYTYC. In lieu of any
fractional shares, there shall be paid to each Stockholder who otherwise would
be entitled to receive a fractional share of CYTYC Common Stock pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent)
determined by multiplying (i) such fraction by (ii) the average of the closing
prices of the CYTYC Common Stock on The Nasdaq National Market over the 30-day
period ending three (3) days prior to the Closing Date (or the exercise date in
the case of Converted Options).

     Section 2.4   Adjustments Following a Stock Recapitalization.  If, at any
                   ----------------------------------------------
time after the date hereof but prior to the Effective Date, the total number of
shares of CYTYC Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of CYTYC Common Stock, outstanding as of the date hereof has been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend or other extraordinary
distribution thereon (collectively, a "Stock Recapitalization"), the
                                       ----------------------
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof  shall be correspondingly
adjusted so as to provide holders of PRO DUCT Common Stock and PRO DUCT
Preferred Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such Stock Recapitalization.  This Section 2.4 shall not apply to any merger
or business combination involving CYTYC in which CYTYC is the surviving
corporation, issuance of shares of CYTYC capital stock or other transaction not
involving a Stock Recapitalization.

Stockholder or any representative of, successor to, heir or deemed beneficiary
of any Stockholder, or any other person or entity seeking to claim or make a
recovery in the name of or by right of such Stockholder, for any CYTYC Common
Stock, any dividends or distributions thereon, proceeds in lieu of issuance of
any fractional shares thereof, or proceeds or distributions from the Escrow
Account, reasonably delivered or paid to a public official or governmental
authority pursuant to any applicable escheat or unclaimed property laws.

     Section 2.6   Other Closing Deliveries. At the Closing, each of CYTYC, SUB

to Articles VI and VII hereunder.

     Section 2.7   Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
                   -----------------
to the contrary, any shares of PRO DUCT Common Stock or PRO DUCT Preferred Stock
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by Stockholders who shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal of
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware Corporation Law or
Section 1300 et seq. of the California Corporations Code (or any successor
provision) (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into
                               ------------------
or represent the right to receive the consideration per share described in
Section 2.2.  Such Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares of PRO DUCT Common Stock or PRO DUCT Preferred
Stock held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
Delaware Corporation Law or Section 1300 et seq. of the California Corporations
Code (or any successor provision), as the case may be, except that Dissenting
Shares held by Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under
Section 262 of the Delaware Corporation Law or Section 1300 et seq. of the
California Corporations Code (or any successor provision), as the case may be,
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any
interest thereon, the consideration per share described in Section 2.2.  PRO
DUCT shall give CYTYC prompt notice of any notice or demands of appraisal or
payment for PRO DUCT Common Stock or PRO DUCT Preferred Stock received by PRO
DUCT prior to the Effective Time.  Prior to the Effective Time, PRO DUCT shall
not, without the prior written consent of CYTYC, make any payments with respect
to, settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands.

     (a)     Prior to Closing Date, CYTYC shall designate its stock transfer
agent and registrar, or other agent, to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the

to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering such PRO
DUCT Certificates in exchange for cash and certificates representing shares of
CYTYC Common Stock. Upon surrender of a PRO DUCT Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such PRO DUCT Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of CYTYC
Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of

                                       13
<PAGE>

surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

     (c)     Promptly following the date which is six (6) months after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Surviving Corporation
all cash, certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions described in this Agreement, and any holders of PRO DUCT
Certificates who have not, prior to such date, complied with this Section 2.8
shall look thereafter only to the Surviving Corporation for the shares of CYTYC
Common Stock, cash payable pursuant to Section 2.2, and any dividends or
distributions with respect to such shares of CYTYC Common Stock, after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings, and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares thereof to which they are entitled pursuant to Sections 2.3 and 2.9.

     Section 2.9   Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting. All
                   ------------------------------------------------
shares of CYTYC Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by CYTYC in respect of the CYTYC Common Stock, the
record date for which is on or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall
include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following
surrender of any such PRO DUCT Certificate pursuant to Section 2.8, there shall
be issued and/or paid to the holder of certificates representing whole shares of
CYTYC Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of
such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of
CYTYC Common Stock and not paid, after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings. Holders of unsurrendered PRO DUCT Certificates shall be entitled
to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of CYTYC stockholders the number
of whole shares of CYTYC Common Stock represented by such PRO DUCT Certificates,

of CYTYC Common Stock and cash payable pursuant to Section 2.2 and any unpaid
dividends or distributions, after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Sections 2.3 and 2.9, without interest, upon due surrender

                                                           ------------
Property"). PRO DUCT has secured valid written assignments from all of its

that is available for an annual license fee of no more than Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000) and Intellectual Property licensed on a non-exclusive basis in

as set forth on Schedule 3.8.3, PRO DUCT's use of the Intellectual Property as
                --------------
currently used and as proposed to be used by PRO DUCT does not conflict with,

third party. No third party has advised PRO DUCT that it is challenging the
validity or enforceability of the Intellectual Property (and PRO DUCT is not
otherwise aware of any such a challenge), and to the knowledge of PRO DUCT, no
third party is infringing or otherwise violating, the Intellectual Property. PRO
DUCT is not, nor will it be as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the performance of its obligations hereunder, in breach of any
license, sublicense or other agreement relating to the Intellectual Property,

the standard Confidentiality Agreement that PRO DUCT utilizes for disclosure to
third parties of Intellectual Property not otherwise protected by issued patents
or copyright ("Confidential Information"). Except where a failure not to do so
               ------------------------
would not have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations
or financial condition of PRO DUCT, all disclosures of Confidential Information
to third parties by PRO DUCT have been made pursuant to such standard
Confidentiality Agreement or a comparable nondisclosure document.

date hereof and as of the Closing Date was, is or will be of good and
merchantable quality, saleable (in the case of Inventory held for sale) or
currently useable (in the case of other Inventory) in the ordinary course of
business, subject to any reserves for non-conforming goods and obsolescence
reflected on the Financial Statements at August 31, 2001.  The value and
classification of all items of Inventory recorded on the Financial Statements
have been determined in accordance with PRO DUCT's historical practices
consistently applied.  PRO DUCT has not received any notice that it will
experience in the foreseeable future any difficulty in obtaining, in the desired

arising subsequent to August 31, 2001, subject to adequate reserves for bad
debts and price discounts and allowances, and, except as set forth on Schedule
                                                                      --------

----
thereof not previously disclosed to CYTYC. The reserves reflected on the August

Common Stock under the PRO DUCT Option and (y) the Cash Ratio, provided,

into escrow as "Option Escrow Cash"); further provided, that the Option Escrow
                ------------------
Cash shall not be placed into escrow if, as of the date of exercise, all Escrow
Shares and Escrow Cash have been retained by CYTYC or released from the Escrow
Account pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 2.2.2 or Section 8.2.2
hereof; provided further, that the amount of such cash consideration in respect
of each PRO DUCT Option Share shall be rounded down to the nearest 1/10,000 of a
cent; and provided further, that the amount of the Replacement Cash Right with
respect to each Converted Option shall be rounded down to the nearest cent.

Each Converted Option and the related Replacement Cash Right must be exercised
together and may not be exercised separately; provided, however, that any
Converted Option may be exercised in part and not in whole to the extent that
the terms of  the option grant and the applicable option plan so permit.  In the
event that a PRO DUCT Option Holder holds more than one PRO DUCT Option, each
such PRO DUCT Option shall be converted into a Converted Option and Replacement
Cash Right for purposes of implementing the assumption and conversion provisions
of this Section 5.6.

          (e)  Subject to the provisions of Section 5.6.1 hereof, all Option
Escrow Shares and Option Escrow Cash shall be placed into escrow in accordance
with the terms and conditions of Section 2.2.2 hereof.  Simultaneous with the
release of Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash pursuant to Section 2.2.2 hereof and in
accordance with the terms and conditions for such release set forth in such
Section 2.2.2, CYTYC shall deliver to all PRO DUCT Option Holders who have
exercised their options after the Effective Time and for whom Option Escrow
Shares and Option Escrow Cash have been placed into escrow, pro rata in
accordance with their ownership percentages of Option Escrow Shares and Option
Escrow Cash placed into escrow under this Agreement and at the addresses set
forth on the Stockholder Information Schedule, the remaining Option Escrow
Shares and Option Escrow Cash.  Once all Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash have been
either retained by CYTYC or released pursuant to the terms and conditions of
Section 2.2.2 and 8.2.2 hereof, no further Option Escrow Shares or Option Escrow
Cash shall be placed into escrow; but thereafter each PRO DUCT Option Holder who
exercises its Converted Option in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the applicable option plan will have the right to receive:

          (x)  the number of shares of CYTYC Common Stock equal to the product
of (i) the number of PRO DUCT Option Shares and (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio,
minus 10% of such product multiplied by the Option Escrow Shares Retention
Factor; provided, however, that any fractional shares of CYTYC Common Stock
resulting from such calculation shall be rounded down to the nearest 1/10,000 of
a share; and

          (y)  the amount of cash in respect of each PRO DUCT Option Share set
forth in subparagraph (d) above, without regard to the provisos thereto, minus
10% of such amount multiplied by the Option Escrow Cash Retention Factor;
provided, however, that the amount of such cash consideration in respect of each
PRO DUCT share shall be rounded down to the nearest 1/10,000 of a cent; and
provided further, that the amount of the Replacement Cash Right with respect to
each Converted Option shall be rounded down to the nearest cent.

extent required to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code and the applicable
Treasury Regulations and to meet the ratio rule in Treasury Regulation (S)1.425-

exercisable and shall vest upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable
to the related PRO DUCT Options immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that all references to PRO DUCT shall be deemed to be references to CYTYC.
CYTYC shall file with the SEC any required registration statement on Form S-8
(or other appropriate form) as soon as practicable after the Closing Date and
shall take any action required to be taken under state securities "Blue Sky"
laws for purposes of registering all shares of CYTYC Common Stock issuable after
the Effective Time upon exercise of the Converted Options.  Following the
Closing, CYTYC will send to each holder of a Converted Option a written notice
setting forth (i) the number of shares of CYTYC Common Stock subject to such
Converted Option, (ii) the Replacement Cash Right that will be received upon
exercise of such Converted Option, and (iii) the exercise price per share of
CYTYC Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Converted Option.  Promptly
following the Closing, CYTYC shall reserve for issuance in connection with the
exercise of Converted Options such number of shares of CYTYC Common Stock as
shall be required to be issued upon such exercise.

Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested
or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition
("PRO DUCT Restricted Stock") providing that such shares may be forfeited or

repurchased by PRO DUCT upon any termination of the Stockholder's employment,
directorship or other relationship with PRO DUCT (and/or any affiliate of PRO
DUCT) under the terms of any restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement with PRO DUCT that does not by its terms provide that such repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, then (i) the shares of CYTYC Common Stock
issued upon the conversion of such shares in the Merger will continue to be
unvested and subject to the same repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or
other conditions (the "Restrictions") following the Effective Time, and the
                       ------------
certificates representing such shares of CYTYC Common Stock may accordingly be
marked with appropriate legends noting such repurchase options, risks of
forfeiture or other conditions, and (ii) the cash consideration issued upon the
conversion of such shares in the Merger will be unvested and subject to
forfeiture as of the Effective Time if such shares of CYTYC Common Stock are
subject to the Restrictions on or after the Effective Time. Such cash
consideration that is unvested as of the Effective Time will be payable to such
holders of CYTYC Common Stock subject to such Restrictions at the time and to
the extent the vesting conditions are satisfied that are described in the
Restricted Stock Agreement to be executed and delivered by each such holder of
CYTYC Common Stock and CYTYC, which Agreement shall be substantially in the form

purposes including all Tax Returns and Tax controversies, to (and, with regard

annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, file
any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim
or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, or consent to any
extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or
assessment; provided, however, that the limitations of this paragraph shall
apply only to the extent the relevant action is material.

promptly deliver to CYTYC true, correct, and complete copies of all Tax Returns
with respect to income taxes filed by PRO DUCT on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Closing Date.

                              -----------
Administrator of the 1998 Stock Plan of PRO DUCT not to issue any determination
to holders of stock options or stock purchase rights thereunder that accelerated
vesting or acceleration of such stock options or stock purchase rights has been
triggered under Section 12(c) or under any other provision of such plan or,
except as required by the agreements set forth on Schedule 5.7.6, will be so

pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement attached as Exhibit H hereto (the
                                                          ---------

     Section 5.9    D&O Indemnification. Schedule 5.9 sets forth all relevant
                    -------------------  ------------
provisions of PRO DUCT's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws and any contract
pursuant to which PRO DUCT granted any rights of indemnification to any director
or officer of PRO DUCT.  From and after the Effective Date, to the extent
permitted under the Delaware Corporation Law, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is, has been at any time prior to
the date hereof, or becomes prior to the Effective Date, a director or an
officer of PRO DUCT (collectively, the "D&O Indemnified Parties") against all
                                        -----------------------
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts
or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by him in his capacity as an officer
or director of PRO DUCT, which acts or omissions occurred prior to the Effective
Date; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall be under no
obligation to indemnify any D&O Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 5.9
except to the extent that such D&O Indemnified Party was entitled to
indemnification from PRO DUCT (pursuant to applicable law or contract)
immediately prior to the Effective Date.  The procedures associated with such
indemnification shall be the same as those associated with the D&O Indemnified
Parties' indemnification from PRO DUCT, immediately prior to the Effective Date.
PRO DUCT hereby agrees that, from and after the date hereof until the Effective
Date, it will not amend, modify or otherwise alter its Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws or any contractual provision under which any D&O
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from PRO DUCT at the time of
the execution of this Agreement.  The provisions of this Section 5.9 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and each D&O Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and
representatives.  CYTYC shall cause to be maintained in effect for a period of
seven (7) years after the Closing, the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
PRO DUCT (provided that CYTYC may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing Date.

     Section 5.10   PRO DUCT Employees.
                    ------------------

                    5.10.1    Benefits. Following the Closing Date and through

December 31, 2001, CYTYC shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide its
employees with benefits which are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to

December 31, 2001, CYTYC shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide the Surviving Corporation's employees with benefits which are
substantially equivalent to those offered to similarly situated employees of
CYTYC. To the extent that CYTYC or the Surviving Corporation offers new benefit
plans to the Surviving Corporation's employees after the Closing, CYTYC or the
Surviving Corporation shall give credit for years of continuous service as an
Employee of PRO DUCT to those persons actively employed by PRO DUCT on the
Closing Date, for purposes of eligibility requirements under such benefit plans
(if any). Any benefit plans offered by CYTYC or the Surviving Corporation to the
former PRO DUCT Employees will waive any applicable exclusions for pre-existing
conditions or eligibility periods, and confer credit for any deductibles or co-
payments

                                       49

accrued during the current PRO DUCT benefit plan year. The Surviving Corporation

it will not issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the
prior written consent of CYTYC and PRO DUCT; provided, however, that such
disclosure can be made without obtaining such prior written consent if (i) the
disclosure is required by law or by obligations imposed pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or quotation system and (ii) the
Party making such disclosure has first used its reasonable efforts to consult
with (but not obtain the consent of) the other Party about the form and
substance of such disclosure.

     Section 5.12   Employment Arrangements. Prior to the Effective Date, PRO
                    -----------------------

employees of PRO DUCT (who will be designated by CYTYC), David Hung, Patrick
Machado, Phil Olsen, Angela Soito, Lynn Seely, Marga Ortigas-Wedekind, and
Leslie Trigg, to enter into employment arrangements (including nondisclosure,
noncompete and nonsolicitation agreements) in substantially the form set forth

                    --------------------------------

                    5.13.1    Standstill. Prior to the Effective Time, PRO DUCT
                              ----------
agrees that it will not, nor will PRO DUCT permit any of its Affiliates, their
officers, directors, employees, or other agents, or any professional person whom
it or any of such entities has retained (collectively the "PRO DUCT Parties"),
                                                           ----------------
to do any of the following:

          (a)  Solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries, proposal,
negotiation or agreement from any corporation, partnership, person, group or
other entity ("Third Party Acquiror") concerning a possible merger,
               --------------------
consolidation or other business combination involving PRO DUCT or an acquisition
of PRO DUCT's capital securities or a substantial portion of its assets
("Acquisition Transaction"); and
  -----------------------

          (b)  Negotiate with any Third Party Acquiror in furtherance of such
inquiries, furnish information to any such entity or enter into any agreement,
arrangement, or understanding with any such Third Party Acquiror with respect to
any Acquisition Transaction or which would require PRO DUCT to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger.

PRO DUCT agrees to notify CYTYC promptly in writing if any PRO DUCT Party
receives any inquiry, proposal, or other contact from a Third Party Acquiror
regarding an Acquisition Transaction or if any Third Party Acquiror seeks to
initiate or continue discussions or

                                       50
<PAGE>

negotiations with a PRO DUCT Party with respect to an Acquisition Transaction,
and will identify such Third Party Acquiror.

                  5.13.2 Superior Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                         --------------------
nothing in this Agreement shall prevent any of the PRO DUCT Parties from (A)
providing information in response to a request therefor by a Third Party
Acquiror who has made an unsolicited bona fide written proposal for an
Acquisition Transaction, (B) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with
any Third Party Acquiror who has made an unsolicited bona fide written proposal
for an Acquisition Transaction, or (C) recommending such an Acquisition
Transaction to the Stockholders if (i) in each such case the Board of Directors
of PRO DUCT determines in good faith that such action is likely to be required
for its directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under
applicable law and (ii) the Board of Directors determines in good faith that
such Acquisition Transaction, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be
consummated, taking into account legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and the Third Party Acquiror making the proposal and would, if
consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(any such favorable Acquisition Transaction being referred to herein as a
"Superior Transaction").

an Affiliate Agreement, CYTYC may place appropriate legends on the certificates

     Section 5.16 Employee Bonus Plan. Effective as of the date hereof, PRO DUCT
                  -------------------
shall adopt and comply with the terms of an employee bonus plan (the "Retention
                                                                      ---------
Bonus Plan") that shall provide that all persons who are currently employees of
----------
PRO DUCT below the level of Vice President and who are employees of the
Surviving Corporation on the six (6) month anniversary of the date hereof shall
be paid a bonus equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of his or her annual base
salary in effect as of the date hereof; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay more than $750,000 in the aggregate
under the Retention Bonus Plan. Payments pursuant to the Retention Bonus Plan

terminated by the Surviving Corporation other than for "Cause" (as such term is
defined below) prior to the six (6) month anniversary of the date hereof shall

termination of his or her employment. Employees of the Surviving Corporation who
voluntarily terminate their employment prior to the six (6) month anniversary of
the date hereof shall not receive any bonus pursuant to the Retention Bonus
Plan; provided, however, that if any such employee's voluntary termination is
due to either (i) a reduction in his or her annual base salary from his or her
annual base salary in effect as of the date hereof or (ii) a relocation from PRO
DUCT's current facility, then such employee shall receive his or her bonus under
the Retention Bonus Plan as of the date of the termination of his or her
employment.

For the purposes of this Section 5.16, "Cause" shall mean (i) gross negligence

               8.2.2  Offset; Limitations; Waiver.   For purposes of this
                      ---------------------------
Section 8.2:


          (a) In the event that CYTYC wishes to make any indemnification claim
under this Section 8.2, CYTYC shall provide written notice of such claim (an
"Indemnification Notice") to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder
-----------------------
Representative.  Any such notice shall, to the extent practicable, set forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the claim and shall include a good faith
determination of the estimated amount of the claim.  Thereafter, the Stockholder
Representative shall have twenty-five (25) Business Days following its receipt
of the Indemnification Notice in which to deliver notice of objection to such
claim to CYTYC and the Escrow Agent.  If no objection notice is given, then the
claim in the amount alleged by CYTYC in the Indemnification Notice shall be
deemed to be valid and indemnifiable pursuant hereto.  No offset shall be
permitted if the relevant claim is timely disputed as set forth above, unless
and until its validity is finally resolved.  In the event that CYTYC is entitled
to offset, CYTYC shall provide written notice (the "Resolved Claim Notice") of
                                                    ---------------------
such offset to the Escrow Agent and the Stockholder Representative.  Within five
(5) Business Days after receipt of the Resolved Claim Notice, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver to CYTYC any Escrow Cash up to the amount of such offset and, to
the extent there is any balance remaining, the Escrow Agent shall also deliver
to CYTYC a sufficient number of the certificates of the Stockholders
representing shares of CYTYC Common Stock to fulfill the requirements of this
Section 8.2.2, whereupon CYTYC shall, subject to Section 2.2.2 above, cancel the
certificates and issue and deliver to the Escrow Agent new certificates, to be
held in escrow, in the names of the Stockholders, which certificates shall cover
a number of shares equal to the number of Escrow Shares covered by the
certificates delivered to CYTYC less a number of shares determined by dividing
the amount of the offset remaining after payment of the Escrow Cash by the
Closing Valuation Price, subject to the requirements of Section 2.2.2.

          (b) No indemnification shall be required pursuant to Section 8.2.1
unless the aggregate of all Losses for which an indemnity payment would
otherwise be due pursuant to Section 8.2.1 exceeds $500,000, and only to the
extent of such excess.

          (c) The obligations of the Stockholders to indemnify CYTYC and SUB
pursuant to this Section 8.2 are personal to the Stockholders and are assumed in
light of the consideration they are to receive at the Closing hereunder, and
each Stockholder waives any rights and releases PRO DUCT or the Surviving
Corporation from any claims or assertions of cross-indemnification or
contribution from PRO DUCT or the Surviving Corporation, whether arising in law
or in equity from and after the Closing, as a result of such Stockholder's
payment, coverage or assumption of any Losses incurred by CYTYC or the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Section 8.2, including any claims or contribution
in respect of any attorneys fees and expenses incurred by such Stockholder in
defending against, or seeking contribution or recovery arising from, his
indemnification obligations under this Section 8.2.  For purposes of this
Section 8.2, Option Escrow Cash and Option Escrow Shares shall be treated in the
same manner and shall be subject to the same offset requirements as the Escrow
Cash and the Escrow Shares, respectively.

     Section 8.3  CYTYC Indemnity.
                  ---------------

                  8.3.1  Indemnification. From and after the Closing Date, CYTYC
                         ---------------
shall indemnify and hold the Stockholders harmless on a dollar-for-dollar basis
from and against all Losses resulting from, arising out of, or due to, directly
or indirectly, any of the following:

             (a) Any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or breach or
nonfulfillment of, any representation or warranty of CYTYC, or any breach or
nonfulfillment of any covenant of CYTYC, contained in this Agreement, in any
schedule delivered hereunder by CYTYC, or in any certificates delivered by CYTYC
pursuant to this Agreement; or

             (b) Any claims, causes of action, rights asserted or demands made
by any third parties (including any governmental authority or agency) arising
from or relating to any inaccuracy or misrepresentation in, or breach or
nonfulfillment of, any representation or warranty of CYTYC, or any breach or
nonfulfillment of any covenant of CYTYC, contained in this Agreement, in any
schedule delivered hereunder by CYTYC, or in any certificates delivered by CYTYC
pursuant to this Agreement.

                  8.3.2  Limitation. No indemnification shall be required
                         ----------
pursuant to Section 8.3.1 unless the aggregate of all Losses for which an
indemnity payment would otherwise be due pursuant to Section 8.3.1 exceeds
$500,000, and only to the extent of such excess.

                  8.3.3  Procedure for Indemnification from Third-Party Claims.
                         -----------------------------------------------------

             (a) Notice. No right to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3.1
                 ------
shall be available to an indemnified Stockholder with respect to a claim from
any person not a Party to this Agreement unless such indemnified Stockholder
shall have given to CYTYC a written notice: (a "Claim Notice") describing in
                                                ------------
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder and enclosing a copy of any papers served, promptly upon the
indemnified Stockholder becoming aware of such facts. In the case of a lawsuit
being filed against any indemnified Stockholder, "promptly" shall mean as soon
                                                  --------
as practicable but in no event later than fifteen (15) days after the
indemnified Stockholder is served with notice of the suit. The failure to notify
CYTYC under this Subsection 8.3.3 shall not relieve CYTYC of any liability that
it may have to the indemnified Stockholder otherwise than under this Article
VIII unless such failure to notify shall have resulted in the waiver of any
affirmative defenses to any third-party claims, whereupon such liability of
CYTYC to the indemnified Stockholder under this Article VIII shall be reduced
only to the extent CYTYC must pay any such third-party claim by reason of the
waiver of an affirmative defense.

             (b) Defense of Claims. Upon receipt by CYTYC of a Claim Notice,
                 -----------------
CYTYC shall have control of the administration and defense of the claim
described therein. The indemnified Stockholder(s) shall have the right to
approve CYTYC's selection of counsel with respect to any such claim, such
approval not to be withheld unreasonably. CYTYC shall bear the fees and expenses
of CYTYC's counsel, as well as the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for
the indemnified Stockholder(s) if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the
indemnified Stockholder(s) a conflict between CYTYC and the indemnified
Stockholder(s) exists as to any

                                       61
<PAGE>

defense, counter claim or third-party claim that may be asserted in respect to
the matter identified in the Claim Notice, and because of such conflict,
separate counsel for the indemnified Stockholder(s) is necessary and
appropriate.

             (c) Settlement. Any indemnified Stockholder(s) shall give prompt
                 ----------
swritten notice to CYTYC of any proposed settlement by a third party of any
Third-Party Claim. CYTYC shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to settle
with money any claim for which indemnification has been sought hereunder, but
shall have no right to settle any such claim by agreeing, or committing to
agree, on behalf of the indemnified Stockholder(s) without its written consent
to any covenant or contract relating to or restricting the conduct of the
business of the indemnified Stockholder(s) or containing any admission or
statement deleterious to the good name or reputation of the indemnified
Stockholder(s) or any affiliate thereof. An indemnified Stockholder(s) may
refuse to accept a settlement proposed by CYTYC, but in such event CYTYC shall
not be obligated to pay more than the amount for which CYTYC was willing to
settle the claim (and any other Losses associated with such settlement), and the
indemnified Stockholder(s) shall be responsible for all Losses greater than such
amount. Except following the refusal by an indemnified Stockholder(s) to accept
a settlement proposed by CYTYC under the condition set forth in the preceding
sentence, no indemnified Stockholder may settle a claim for which
indemnification has been sought hereunder.

             (d) Cooperation. Any indemnified Stockholder(s) shall make
                 -----------
available to CYTYC, and its attorneys and accountants, all books, records and
documents relating to any claim hereunder, and the Parties shall render to each
other reasonable assistance in the defense of any claim hereunder, that is made
by any person not a Party to this Agreement.

     Section 8.4  Limitations on Remedies.  Absent fraud, intentional
                  -----------------------
misrepresentation or criminal activity, the indemnification rights and
procedures provided in this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive post-
Closing remedies available to any Party or the Stockholders for any claims under
or based upon this Agreement; provided, however, that no Stockholder shall be
liable to CYTYC or the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement for the fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or criminal activity of any other Stockholder.
Absent fraud, intentional misrepresentation or criminal activity, CYTYC shall
have no recourse or remedy for any indemnification claim under this Agreement
other than offset against the Escrow Cash and/or the Escrow Shares, as
applicable.

                                  ARTICLE IX.

PRO DUCT, on the other hand, upon written notice if a material default or breach
shall be made by the other, with respect to the due and timely performance of
any of the other Party's

                                       62

respective covenants and agreements contained herein, or with respect to the due
compliance with any of its respective representations and warranties contained

DUCT (a) withdraws, amends or modifies in a manner adverse to CYTYC or SUB its
recommendation or approval in respect of this Agreement or the Merger, or (b)
makes any recommendation with respect to a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving PRO DUCT and a third party or the acquisition of
all or any significant portion of the assets or capital stock of PRO DUCT by a
third party, other than a recommendation to reject such potential transaction,
or (ii) if Major Stockholders have not voted their shares of PRO DUCT Common
Stock and PRO DUCT Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions

federal or state court of competent jurisdiction) preventing the consummation of
the Merger shall have become final and nonappealable, or (b) the approval of the
Stockholders required by Section 3.23 shall not have been obtained at a meeting
duly convened therefor or any adjournment thereof or by written consent
(provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Subsection
9.1.4(b) shall not be available to either Party where the failure to obtain such
stockholder approval shall have been caused by the action or failure to act of
such Party and such action or failure constitutes a breach by such Party of this
Agreement).

                 9.1.5  Mutual Consent. By written mutual consent of CYTYC and
                        --------------
SUB, on one hand, and PRO DUCT, on the other.

                 9.1.6  Closing. Without further action of the Parties, if the
                        -------

                        -------

incurred by the other Party as a result of such breach.

termination. For purposes of making this calculation, each share of CYTYC Common

of CYTYC Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market over the 30-day period
ending three (3) days prior to the date of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

or CYTYC in connection with Section 7.1.4 hereof, then either Party may demand
binding arbitration of the question of whether a material adverse change has
occurred by sending written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that
no dispute in connection with Section 6.1.4 hereof shall be subject to
arbitration, except under the circumstances set forth in Section 6.1.4, if it
concerns an office action or other communication from the US Patent and
Trademark Office with respect to US Patent Application Serial No. 09/473,510
that rejects, or indicates that it may intend to reject, any of the independent
product claims on grounds that might lead to a narrowing of the scope of any of

any decision as to remedies to be provided by one Party to another; or (iii)
compel a Party to pay any fees, costs or expenses incurred by the other Party in
connection with any arbitration conducted pursuant to this ection 10.10. The
dispute will be determined by arbitration in Wilmington, elaware in accordance
with the Non-Administered Arbitration Rules & Commentary (Revised 2000) of the
CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution by a tribunal of three independent and
impartial arbitrators, one of which will be appointed by each of PRO DUCT and
CYTYC, and the third of which shall have had both training and experience as an
arbitrator of diagnostic industry and other general commercial matters If the
Parties to this Agreement cannot agree on the third arbitrator, then the third
arbitrator will be selected by the President of the CPR Institute for Dispute
Resolution in accordance with the criteria set forth in the preceding sentence.
Any decision of the tribunal must be consistent with the provisions of this
Section 10.10 and the tribunal must set forth its decision in a writing within
sixty (60) days of the submission of the dispute to arbitration pursuant to this
Section 10.10, which writing must include an explanation of the reasons for such
decision. Any arbitration pursuant to this Section 10.10 will be governed by
Delaware law pursuant to Section 10.9, and by the arbitration law of the Federal
Arbitration Act -33- 34 (9 U.S.C. sec.1 et seq.). Subject to Section 6.1.4, all

the arbitration, will be shared equally by the Parties to this Agreement unless
