Proposal) and with other terms

giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition,
including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any Person or
"group" of Persons that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would

will be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time all (a) of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation; and (b) debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 



 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended and restated in its entirety in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation.

 



 

(b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the bylaws of the Surviving

2.6 _Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) _Directors_. The Parties will take all necessary actions so that at the
Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation will be the

the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified.

 



 

(b) _Officers_. The Parties will take all necessary actions so that at the
Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the

2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities, the following will occur:

 



 

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate representing
ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter
represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

 



 

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as
treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time

 



      
 

 



 

(collectively, the " **Owned Company Shares** ") will be cancelled without any
conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor; and

 



 

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting
Company Shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who
have neither voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement nor consented
thereto in writing and who have properly and validly exercised their statutory
rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " **Dissenting Company Shares**
") will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except
that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who have
failed to perfect or who have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided
in Section 2.9.

 



 

(ii) The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in and
direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The
Company may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer
to settle any such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company
Shares.

 



 

2.8 _Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Surrendered Company Options._ Each Company Option that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is (i) vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) listed on Section 2.8(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a " **Surrendered Company Option** "),
will, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock that
would have been issuable upon exercise of such Surrendered Company Option
prior to the Effective Time less the applicable exercise price for each such
share of Company Common Stock under such Surrendered Company Option and any
applicable withholding Taxes in accordance with Section

 



      
 

 



 

2.12. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the exercise price per
share under any Surrendered Company Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Surrendered Company Option shall be cancelled as of
the Effective Time without payment therefor and shall have no further force or
effect.

 



 

(b) _Assumed Company Options_. Each Company Option that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, has an exercise price per share that
is less than the Merger Consideration and is not a Surrendered Company Option
(each, an " **Assumed Company Option** "), will, as of the Effective Time, be,
as determined by Parent, (x) assumed by Parent and converted into an option to
acquire, or (y) converted into an option granted pursuant to Parents 2001
Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the " **Parent Stock Plan** "), to
acquire, in each case, on the same material terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time (with the terms of such Assumed Company Option not being economically
detrimental to the holder thereof and no adverse change to the vesting
schedule and with other terms and conditions relating to method and manner of
payment and exercise, and post-termination exercise periods, to the extent
administratively practicable, to be no less favorable, it being understood
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change in
control" for purposes of the Company Stock Plans and award agreements
thereunder), a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Option as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio,
at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of (A) the per share exercise price for
the Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Stock Award
Exchange Ratio. As a result of any such conversion provided for in clause (y)
above, any such Assumed Company Options shall be subject to all of the terms
and conditions of the Parent Stock Plan and grant agreements for the Assumed
Company Options (rather than the terms and conditions of the Company Stock
Plan and grant agreements under which the Assumed Company Options were
originally issued), subject to the foregoing sentence. The exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock subject to any such Assumed Company Option will
be determined in a manner consistent with the preceding and the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code and, to the extent applicable, Section 424 of the
Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, Parent may
elect to treat some or all Company Options that would otherwise be Assumed
Company Options as vested Surrendered Company Options, which will be settled
in accordance with Section 2.8(a), with the vesting of such Company Options
fully accelerated prior to such treatment. Each Company Option that is (x)
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (y) has an exercise
price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration and
(z) is not a Surrendered Company Option shall be cancelled as of the Effective
Time without payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect.

 



 

(c) _Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards_. Each Company Stock-Based Award
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (i) is
vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) is listed on
Section 2.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter and, in each case, by its
terms is to be settled upon the occurrence of vesting or the Effective Time
(each, a " **Surrendered Company Stock-Based Award** "), will, as of the
Effective Time, be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed to be vested and will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common
Stock subject to the Surrendered Company Stock-Based Award, less any
applicable withholding Taxes in accordance with Section 2.12.

 



 

(d) _Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards_. Each Company Stock-Based Award that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and is not a
Surrendered Company Stock-Based Award (each, an " **Assumed Company Stock-
Based Award** "), will, as of the Effective Time, be, as determined by Parent,
(x) assumed by Parent and converted into a stock-based award or (y) converted
into a stock-based award granted pursuant to the Parent Stock Plan, in each
case, with the same material terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Assumed Company Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
(with no adverse change to the vesting terms and with other terms and
conditions, including relating to satisfaction of tax withholding obligations,
to the extent administratively practicable to be no less favorable, it being
understood that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a
"change in control" for purposes of the Company Stock Plans and award
agreements thereunder), in respect of a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company
Stock-Based Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio. As a result of any such conversion
provided for in clause (y) above, any such Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards
shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Parent Stock Plan
and grant agreements for the Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards (rather than
the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan and grant agreements under
which the Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards were originally issued), subject
to the foregoing sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Closing
Date, Parent may elect to treat some or all Company Stock-Based Awards that
would otherwise be Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards as vested Surrendered
Company Stock-Based Awards, which will be settled in accordance with Section
2.8(c), but the vesting of such Company Stock-Based Awards will be fully
accelerated prior to such treatment, except that the applicable settlement
date may be delayed to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(e) _Parent Actions Related to Assumed Awards_. Parent will take such actions
as are reasonably necessary, if any, to reserve for issuance a number of
authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise or settlement of the Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company
Stock-Based Awards. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), to the extent
the Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards are not
already registered by Parent under the Securities Act, Parent will cause to be
filed with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-
effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the
Securities Act, with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
the Assumed Company Options and Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards. Parent
will use the same level of efforts that it uses to maintain the effectiveness
of its other registration statements on Form S-8 to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement for so long as any Assumed Company Options or
Assumed Company Stock-Based Awards remain outstanding.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company
Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, will
adopt any resolutions and take any actions within its authority with respect
to the Company Stock Plans and the award agreements thereunder as are
reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Section 2.8, including (i) providing notice to each holder of a Company Option
or Company Stock-Based Award in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent of the
treatment of the Company Options or Company Stock-Based Awards set forth in
this Agreement; and (ii) satisfying all applicable requirements of Rule
16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company will provide Parent
with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon (and
Parents review and delivery of comments will occur promptly after the Company
provides Parent with such drafts and the Companys acceptance of Parents
reasonable comments will not be unreasonably withheld), all notices,
resolutions and other written actions or communications as may be required to
give effect to the provisions of this Section 2.8.

 



 

(g) _Payment Procedures_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the aggregate amount owed to holders of Surrendered Company
Options and Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards. As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than four
Business Days following the Closing Date, the applicable holders of
Surrendered Company Options and Surrendered Company Stock-Based Awards will
receive a payment from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, through its
payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such
holders in respect of Surrendered Company Options or Surrendered Company
Stock-Based Awards that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a)
or Section 2.8(c), as applicable. All such payments will be less any
applicable withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment
owed to a holder of Surrendered Company Options or Surrendered Company Stock-
Based Awards pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(c), as applicable,
cannot be made through the Companys or the Surviving Corporations payroll
system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check
for such payment to such holder, which check will be sent by overnight courier
to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event more than
five Business Days thereafter). All such payments will be less any applicable
withholding Taxes.

 



 

(h) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. With respect to the Companys
2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " **ESPP** "), as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) will adopt resolutions or take other actions as may be required to
provide that each individual participating in the Offering Period (as defined
in the ESPP) in progress on the date of this Agreement or, solely with respect
to clause (ii), that commences after the date of this Agreement, but before
the Effective Time, will not be permitted to (i) increase his or her payroll
contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect when that
Offering Period commenced; or (ii) make separate non-payroll contributions to
the ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement, except as may be required
by applicable Law. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all
action that may be necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the
Merger, (A) cause any Offering Period that would otherwise be outstanding at
the Effective Time to be terminated no later than one Business Day prior to
the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata adjustments
that may be necessary to reflect the

 



      
 

 



 

shortened Offering Period, but otherwise treat such shortened Offering Period
as a fully effective and completed Offering Period for all purposes pursuant
to the ESPP; (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than one Business Day
prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs) of each outstanding
purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (D) provide that no further Offering
Period or purchase period will commence pursuant to the ESPP after the
Effective Time. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds
credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participants
payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and
effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to the consummation of the
Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP.

 



 

2.9 _Surrender of Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent and Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
enter into a customary agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company with a paying agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " **Paying Agent** ") for the payment of the per share Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.7(a)(iii). At or promptly following the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying
Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient in the aggregate
to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments in
respect of Company Common Stock under Section 2.7(a)(iii) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange Fund** ") in trust for the benefit
of the holders of the Shares. The Paying Agent will deliver the Merger
Consideration to be issued pursuant to Section 2.7 out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as provided in Section 2.7, the Exchange Fund will not be used for any
other purpose.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than two
Business Days thereafter), to each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares (as
defined below) or a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) (the "
**Certificates** ") whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a
letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, with respect to Book-Entry Shares,
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form or such
other evidence as the Paying Agent may reasonably request, and which letter of
transmittal will be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent
and the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify); and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 2.11) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions,
the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for the
number of shares represented by such Certificate, and

 



       
 

 



 

Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as
promptly as practicable, in respect of such Certificate the amount of Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to pursuant to Section 2.7. The
Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-
entry form (" **Book-Entry Shares** ") will not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.7. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more
Book-Entry Shares (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company
Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration will upon receipt of an "agents message" in
customary form (it being understood that the holders of Book-Entry Shares
shall be deemed to have surrendered such Shares upon receipt by the Paying
Agent of an "agents message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time be entitled to receive for
the number of Book-Entry Shares, and Parent will cause the Paying Agent to pay
and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of
such Book-Entry Shares the amount of Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to pursuant to Section 2.7. The Book-Entry Shares of such holder will
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(c) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. Until disbursed in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the cash in the Exchange Fund will be
invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). No losses
with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund will affect the amounts
payable to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Any income from
investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs.

 



 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered or transferred
in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of
the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered or
transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-

 



      
 

 



 

Entry Shares, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent
designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or are otherwise
not payable.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which
any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such cash
in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who
have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange
pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares solely to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws), as general creditors
thereof, for any claim to the Merger Consideration to which such holders may
be entitled pursuant to Section 2.7.

 



 

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b)
each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares theretofore representing any
shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor
in accordance with Section 2.7, or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares,
the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(b). The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to
compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9) be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 



 

2.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue
in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.7. Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or

 



      
 

 



 

destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

2.12 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company and
the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options
such amounts as will be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant
to any Tax laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld
they will be (a) paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority for
crediting to the account of the Person from whom such amounts were withheld,
and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



 

2.13 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company
and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all
such lawful and necessary action.

 



 

2.14 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. If, during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock occurs as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, or any record date
for any such purpose is established, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement will be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III** ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

With respect to any Section of this Article III, except (a) as disclosed in
the reports, statements and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC
or furnished by the Company to the SEC, in each case pursuant to the Exchange
Act on or after January 1, 2015, and prior to the date of this Agreement
(other than any disclosures contained or referenced therein under the captions
"Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements," "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk" and any other disclosures contained or
referenced therein of information, factors or risks that are predictive,
cautionary or forward-looking in nature) (the " **Company Recent SEC Reports**
") (it being understood that (i) any matter disclosed in any Company Recent
SEC Report will be deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company
Disclosure Letter only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from such
disclosure in such Company Recent SEC Report that it is applicable to such
section of the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) this clause (a) will not
apply to any of Section 3.2, Section 3.3, Section 3.4, Section 3.7 and the
second sentence of Section 3.12(a)); or (b) as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

3.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company (a) is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL; and (b)
has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it
is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties,
rights and assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties, rights
and assets owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary (to the extent that the concept of "good standing" is
applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent
true, correct and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the " **Charter** ") and the Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company (the " **Bylaws** "), each as amended to date.
The Charter and Bylaws are in full force and effect on the date of this
Agreement. The Company is not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws.

 



 

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement; (b) perform its
covenants and obligations hereunder; and (c) subject to receiving the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, consummate the Merger. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of
its covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and no additional corporate actions on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder; or (iii) subject to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally; and (B) is
subject to general principles of equity.

 



 

3.3 _Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws_.

 



 

(a) _Company Board Approval_. The Company Board has (i) determined that it is
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; (ii) approved the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by
the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;
(iii) directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to a vote at a
meeting of the stockholders of the Company and (iv) resolved to recommend that
the Company Stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL (collectively, the " **Company Board Recommendation**
").

 



 

(b) _Fairness Opinion_. The Company Board has received the written opinion (or
an oral opinion to be confirmed in writing) of its financial advisor, Qatalyst
Partners LP (the " **Advisor** "), to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion and based upon and subject to the

 



      
 

 



 

various qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the consideration to
be received by the holders of shares of Company Class A Common Stock, in their
capacity as holders of Company Class A Common Stock (other than Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent, if applicable), pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a
financial point of view to such holders (it being understood and agreed that
such written opinion is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be
relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub). Promptly after the date of this
Agreement, the Company will deliver a copy of such opinion to Parent for
information purposes only.

 



 

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Assuming that the representations of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6 are true and correct, the Company Board
has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on business
combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other similar
applicable "anti-takeover" Law will not be applicable to this Agreement or the
Merger. No other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or
other similar antitakeover statute or regulation enacted under any Laws
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is applicable to this
Agreement or the Merger.

 



 

3.4 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. Assuming that the representations of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.6(b) are true and correct, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote to adopt this
Agreement (the " **Requisite Stockholder Approval** ") is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock that is necessary
pursuant to applicable Law, the Charter or the Bylaws to consummate the
Merger.

 



 

3.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger do not (a) violate or conflict
with any provision of the Charter or the Bylaws or the equivalent
organizational or governing documents of any "significant subsidiary" of the
Company (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC);
(b) violate or conflict with any provision of the organizational or governing
documents of any Subsidiary of the Company that is not a "significant
subsidiary" (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the
SEC) of the Company; (c) violate, conflict with, result in the breach of,
constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default) pursuant to, result in the termination of, accelerate
the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration pursuant to any Material Contract; (d) assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in Section 3.6 and, in the case of the consummation of
the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate
or conflict with any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or by which any of their respective properties, rights or assets are bound; or
(e) result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any
of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
in the case of each of clauses (b), (c), (d) and (e) for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or Liens that would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

3.6 _Requisite Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to (any of the
foregoing, a " **Consent** ") any Governmental Authority is required on the
part of the Company in connection with the (a) execution and delivery

 



      
 

 



 

of this Agreement by the Company; (b) performance by the Company of its
covenants and obligations pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) consummation of
the Merger, except (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware; (ii) such filings and approvals
as may be required by any federal or state securities Laws, including
compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act; (iii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws set forth on Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter; (iv) the rules of NYSE; and (v) such other Consents the failure of
which to obtain would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(i) 1,120,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 1,000,000,000 of which are

true, correct and complete list of the name and jurisdiction of organization
of each Subsidiary of the Company. Each Subsidiary of the Company (i) is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the Laws of its

standing" is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United
States); and (ii) has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on
its respective business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease
or operate its respective properties and assets, except where the failure to

business is conducted on the date of this Agreement.

securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company; (ii)

any of its Subsidiaries to acquire from any Subsidiary of the Company, or that
obligate any Subsidiary of the Company to issue, any capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interest in, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company; or (iii) obligations of any
Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any subscription,
warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security, or other similar
Contract relating to any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest

 



      
 

 



 

(including any voting debt) in, such Subsidiary to any Person other than the

5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Subject to the terms of Section 5.3(b),
from the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company
will cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with and
terminate any data room access (or other diligence access) of any Person and
its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents,
representatives and advisors (collectively, " **Representatives** ") relating
to any Acquisition Transaction. Promptly following the date of this Agreement,
the Company will request that each Person (other than Parent and its
Representatives) that has, prior to the date of this Agreement, executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
the Company to promptly return or destroy all non-public information furnished
to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality
agreement. Subject to the terms of Section 5.3(b) and Section 5.3(d), from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, executive and other officers will
not, and the Company will not authorize or direct any of its or its
Subsidiaries employees, consultants or other Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal
that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any
designees of Parent or Merger Sub) any non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford to any Person access to the
business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information,
or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
Parent,

 



       
 

 



 

Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub), in any such case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate
or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
(iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or with respect to any inquiries from
third Persons relating to making a potential Acquisition Proposal (other than
only informing such Persons of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3);
(iv) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (any such letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract
relating to an Acquisition Transaction, an " **Alternative Acquisition
Agreement** "); or (vi) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing. From
the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company
will not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any provision
of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to the extent that such
provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made
to the Company Board (or any committee thereof).

 



 

(b) _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth in
this Section 5.3, from the date of this Agreement until the Companys receipt
of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their
Representatives (including the Advisor), following the execution of an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel,
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person or its Representatives
(including, for these purposes, sources of financing) that has made or
delivered to the Company a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the
date of this Agreement that was not solicited in breach of Section 5.3(a), but
only if the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (i) such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; and (ii) the failure to take the
actions contemplated by this Section 5.3(b) would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law. In connection with the foregoing,
the Company will prior to or contemporaneously make available to Parent any
non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is
provided to any such Person or its Representatives that was not previously
made available to Parent.

 



 

(c) _No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Except as provided by Section 5.3(d), at no time after
the date of this Agreement may the Company Board (or a committee thereof):

 



 

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent; (B) adopt, approve or recommend an Acquisition
Proposal; (C) fail to publicly

 



      
 

 



 

reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within 10 Business Days of the
occurrence of a material event or development and after Parent so requests in
writing (or if the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled to be held within
10 Business Days, then within one Business Day after Parent so requests); (D)
take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any
recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a
recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the 10th Business
Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with
such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of
this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a "
**Company Board Recommendation Change** "), it being understood that neither
(1) the determination in itself by the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal nor (2) the delivery in itself by the Company to Parent of
any notice contemplated by Section 5.3(d) will constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change or violate this Section 5.3; or

 



 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval:

 



 

(i) other than in connection with a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law if and only if:

 



 

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board has (A) so
determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i), which notice will describe the Intervening
Event in reasonable detail; and

 



 

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
and its Representatives, during such three Business Day period, have (A)
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board no longer determines in
good faith that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties pursuant to applicable Law; and (B) permitted Parent and its
Representatives to

 



      
 

 



 

make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any
adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make
such a presentation); or

 



 

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal, then the
Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with
respect to such Superior Proposal or (B) authorize the Company to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case if
and only if:

 



 

(1) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law;

 



 

(2) the Company has complied with its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; and

 



 

(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three
Business Days in advance (the " **Notice Period** ") to the effect that the
Company Board has (A) received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
has not been withdrawn; (B) concluded in good faith that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and (C) resolved to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 5.3(d)(ii), which notice will describe the basis for such Company
Board Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the
Person or "group" of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) prior to effecting such
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its
Representatives, during the Notice Period, have (1) negotiated with Parent and
its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and (2) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments
with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a
presentation), it being understood that (a) in the event of any material
revisions to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 5.3(d)(ii)(3) with respect to such new written notice (with the
"Notice Period" in respect of such new written notice being two Business
Days); and (b) the Company Board, at the end of the Notice Period (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), must have
in good faith reaffirmed its determination that such bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) _Notice_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective
Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any event, by the later of (i) 24
hours from the receipt thereof or (ii) 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the next
Business Day) notify Parent if any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry from any
third Person related to making a potential Acquisition Proposal is, to the
Knowledge of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or of any member of the Company Board, received by, any non-public
information is requested from or any discussions or negotiations are sought to
be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives.
Such notice must include (A) the identity of the Person or "group" of Persons
making such offers or proposals (unless, in each case, such disclosure is
prohibited pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality agreement with such
Person or "group" of Persons that is in effect on the date of this Agreement);
and (B) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such offers or
proposals or if such Acquisition Proposal or request is in writing, a copy
thereof. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
prompt basis, of the status and terms of any such offers or proposals
(including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

 



 

(f) _Certain Disclosures_. So long as the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure (other than a
customary "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act), then nothing in
this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying
with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including a "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any substantially similar communication); (ii) complying with Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (iii) making
any disclosure to the Company Stockholders (including regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) that the Company Board (or a committee thereof), after
consultation with outside counsel, has determined in good faith is required by
applicable Law. In addition, so long as the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure (other than a
customary "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act), then it is
understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually
accurate public statement by the Company or the Company Board solely that (A)
describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal; (B) identifies the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal; (C) provides the material terms of
such Acquisition Proposal; or (D) describes the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto will not be deemed to be (1) a withholding, withdrawal,
amendment, qualification or modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the
Company Board Recommendation; (2) an adoption, approval or recommendation with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (3) a Company Board Recommendation
Change.

 



 

(g) _Breach by Representatives_. The Company agrees that any action taken by
any Representative (other than any employee or consultant of the Company who
is not an executive or other officer of the Company) of the Company that, if
taken by the Company, would be a breach of this Section 5.3, then such action
will be deemed to constitute a breach by the Company of this Section 5.3.

 



 

5.4 _No Control of the Company s Business_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are not intended to give
Parent or Merger Sub, directly or

 



      
 

 



 

indirectly, the right to control or direct the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries will exercise, consistent
with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over their own business and operations.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI** ** 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS**

 



 

6.1 _Required Action and Forbearance; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and provided that at all times the provisions of
Section 6.2 shall govern the matters set forth therein, Parent and Merger Sub,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to (A) take (or cause to be taken) all actions; (B) do
(or cause to be done) all things; and (C) assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing (or causing to be done) all things, in each case as are
necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger, including by using reasonable best efforts to:

 



 

(i) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII to be
satisfied;

 



 

(ii) (1) seek to obtain all consents, waivers, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities; and (2) make all registrations,
declarations and filings with Governmental Authorities, in each case that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger; and

 



 

(iii) (1) seek to obtain all consents, waivers and approvals and (2) deliver
all notifications pursuant to any Material Contracts (or other applicable
Contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries) in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger so as to seek to maintain and
preserve the benefits to the Surviving Corporation of such Material Contracts
(or other applicable Contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries) as of and
following the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(b) _No Failure to Take Necessary Action_. In addition to the foregoing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, neither Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will take any
action, or fail to take any action, that is intended to or has (or would
reasonably be expected to have) the effect of (i) preventing, impairing,
delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the Merger; or
(ii) the ability of such Party to fully perform its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company taken in
compliance with Section 5.3 will be considered a violation of this Section
6.1.

 



 

(c) _Certain Notices_. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) notify its legal, finance
and corporate development professionals of the restrictions contained in
Section 5.3(a); and (ii) direct them to comply with the terms of Section
5.3(a).

 



      
 

 



 

6.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

 



 

(a) _Filing Under the HSR Act_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their
respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company (and
its Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, will, to the extent
required in the reasonable judgment of counsel to Parent and the Company, use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) file with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this
Agreement and the Merger as required by the HSR Act promptly following the
date of this Agreement; and (ii) promptly file comparable pre-merger or post-
merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any Governmental
Authority that are required by other applicable Antitrust Laws in connection
with the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company will (A) cooperate and
coordinate (and cause its respective Affiliates to cooperate and coordinate,
if applicable) with the other in the making of such filings; (B) use its
respective reasonable best efforts to supply the other (or cause the other to
be supplied) with any information that may be required in order to make such
filings; (C) use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply (or cause
the other to be supplied) any additional information that reasonably may be
required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the Governmental Authorities of
any other applicable jurisdiction in which any such filing is made; (D) use
its respective reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to (1)
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods pursuant
to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger; and (2)
obtain any required consents pursuant to any Antitrust Laws applicable to the
Merger, in each case as soon as practicable; and (E) prior to independently
participating in any material meeting, or engaging in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings
or any investigations or other inquiries relating thereto, provide notice to
the other party of such meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the
one hand, and the Company (and its Affiliates), on the other hand, will
promptly inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding the Merger in connection with such filings. If any Party or
Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger pursuant
to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Merger, then such
Party will use reasonable best efforts to make (or cause to be made), as soon
as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Parties, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.

 



 

(b) _Divestitures_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if
and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the Merger pursuant to the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws set forth in Section 7.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective
Affiliates) will and, solely to the extent requested by Parent, the Company
and its Affiliates will: (i) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other
equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,
products or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (B) any other
restrictions on the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (ii)
contest, defend and appeal any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will not be required, either pursuant to
this Section 6.2(b) or otherwise, to offer, negotiate, commit to, effect or
otherwise take any action with respect to the Company and its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, product lines, assets, permits,
operations, rights, or interest therein if taking such action would reasonably
be expected to be materially adverse to the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent will not be required, either pursuant to
this Section 6.2(b) or otherwise, to offer, negotiate, commit to, effect or
otherwise take any action with respect to the Parent or any of its Affiliates
or their respective businesses, product lines, assets, permits, operations,
rights, or interest therein (other than with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent required by this Section 6.2(b)) if taking such
action would reasonably be expected to (A) have a material impact on the
benefits expected to be derived from the Merger by Parent or (B) have more
than an immaterial impact on any business or product line of Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

6.3 _Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation_. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement the Company
will prepare (with Parents reasonable cooperation) and file as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within 15 Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement to be sent to the
Company Stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting (the
proxy statement, including any amendments or supplements, the " **Proxy
Statement** ") relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company will
not file the Proxy Statement with the SEC without first providing Parent and
its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and the
Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested by Parent or its counsel. Subject to Section 5.3, the
Company must include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.
The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments,
if any, with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof. Promptly following confirmation by the SEC that the SEC has
no further comments, the Company will cause the Proxy Statement in definitive
form to be mailed to the Company Stockholders.

 



 

(b) _Assistance_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will furnish all
information concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the other, and
provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested by such other
Party to be included therein and will otherwise reasonably assist and
cooperate with the other in the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Proxy Statement and the resolution of any comments to either received from the
SEC.

 



 

(c) _SEC Correspondence_. The Parties will notify each other promptly of the
receipt of any comments, whether written or oral, from the SEC or its staff
and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required
Parent Filing, or for additional information, and will supply each other with
copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to such
filings.

 



 

(d) _No Amendments_. Except in connection with a Company Board Recommendation
Change, no amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the
Company without the approval of Parent, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
connection with the Merger pursuant to applicable Law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an " **Other Required Company Filing** "), then the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file such
Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required
Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and NYSE.
Except in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change or thereafter,
the Company may not file any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC
without first providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon.

 



 

(f) _Other Required Parent Filing_. If Parent or Merger Sub determines that it
is required to file any document with the SEC as a result of the Merger or the
Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to applicable law (an " **Other Required
Parent Filing** "), then Parent and Merger Sub will use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly prepare and file such Other Required Parent Filing with
the SEC. Except in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change or
thereafter, neither Parent nor Merger Sub may file any Other Required Parent
Filing with the SEC without first providing the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.

 



 

(g) _Accuracy; Supplied Information_.

 



 

(i) _Company_. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company
Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by
the Company with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied
by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will not, at the time that such Proxy Statement is filed with the
SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading.

 



 

(ii) _Parent_. The information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement or any Other Required Company Filing will not, at the time that the
Proxy Statement or such Other Required Company Filing is filed with the SEC,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Parent
or Merger Sub with respect to any information supplied by the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing.

 



      
 

 



 

6.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 



 

(a) _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. The Company will take all action
necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Charter, the Bylaws and the rules
of NYSE to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " **Company Stockholder Meeting** ")
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company will convene, subject to Section 6.4(b), and hold
the Company Stockholder Meeting on or around the 20th Business Day following
the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders. Subject to
Section 5.3 and unless there has been a Company Board Recommendation Change,
the Company will include (i) the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement; and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies to
obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

 



 

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Company will be permitted to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if, but only if, (i) there are holders
of an insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present or represented
by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the
Company Stockholder Meeting; (ii) the Company is required to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, order or a request
from the SEC or its staff; or (iii) the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is required by
applicable Law to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting,
including, if the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is required by applicable
Law, in order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any
information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company
Stockholders or otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders by
issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or otherwise. In no
event will the Company Stockholder Meeting be postponed or adjourned (i) by
more than 10 calendar days at a time without the prior written consent of
Parent; or (ii) with respect to Section 6.4(b)(i), by more than 30 calendar
days after the date on which the Company Stockholder Meeting was (or was
required to be) originally scheduled without the prior written consent of
Parent. In no event will the record date of the Company Stockholder Meeting be
changed without Parents prior written consent, unless required by applicable
Law.

 



 

6.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board will (a) take all
actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b)
if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Merger, take all action within their power to ensure that
the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger.

 



 

6.6 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
the Company will afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to

 



      
 

 



 

the properties, books and records, facilities and personnel and
Representatives of the Company, except that the Company may restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that
(a) any applicable Law or regulation requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (b) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable
to such documents or information so long as the Company has taken all
reasonable steps to permit inspection of or to disclose such information and
to respond in a timely manner to all subsequent queries by Parent and its
Representatives based on such information on a basis that does not compromise
the Companys attorney-client or other privilege with respect thereto; or (c)
access to a Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate
or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate
or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract. Subject to applicable
Law, the Company will provide Parent with reports of the Company reasonably
requested by Parent. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this Section 6.6 will be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Companys reasonable
security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to
perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its
Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this Section 6.6. All requests for access pursuant to
this Section 6.6 must be directed to the General Counsel of the Company, or
another person designated in writing by the Company.

 



 

6.7 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company will take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by
each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company, to be
exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Parent will
take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any
acquisitions of equity securities of Parent (including derivative securities)
in connection with the Merger by each individual who is contemplated to become
a director or executive officer of Parent, to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

6.8 _Directors  and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor and fulfill, in all respects, the
obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements set
forth on Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter in effect on the date
of this Agreement between the Company, on the one hand, and any of their
respective current or former directors, officers or employees (and any person
who becomes a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand (collectively,
the " **Indemnified Persons** "). In addition, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other
similar organizational documents of the Surviving

 



       
 

 



 

Corporation to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation
and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth
in the Charter and the Bylaws as of the date of this Agreement. During such
six-year period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of Section 6.8(a), during the period commencing at the Effective
Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
or pursuant to any indemnification agreements set forth on Section 6.8(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter with the Company in effect on the date of this
Agreement, each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and
expenses (including attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or
compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding
arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to
(i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified
Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action
or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the
Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto, except that if, at any
time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified
Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.8(b), then the claim asserted in
such notice will survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until
such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal
Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time; (B) each Indemnified Person will be
entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the fees and expenses of which will
be paid by the Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving
Corporation elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C)
the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees
and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the
defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation
elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if
it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement
of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her prior written consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle
or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with
respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied
with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel
selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel

 



      
 

 



 

will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
(" **D andO Insurance**") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section
6.8(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums
in excess of 250% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year, which amount is set forth on Section 6.8(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (such 250% amount, the " **Maximum Annual Premium** "). If
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance carrier.
Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the DandO Insurance
pursuant to this Section 6.8(c), the Company may (or if Parent requests, the
Company will) purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect to the DandO
Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance carrier so
long as the annual cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum
Annual Premium. If the Company purchases such a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such "tail"
policy is in full force and effect.

 



 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns will (i) consolidate with or merge into
any other Person and not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
in such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provisions will be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective successors or assigns will assume all of the obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.8.

 



 

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.8 may not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects
any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary pursuant to
the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and
their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such
affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons
or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the
"tail" policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and their heirs and
representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section
6.8, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the
DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.8(c) (and their
heirs and representatives)) pursuant to this Section 6.8 will be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company;
(iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 



 

(f) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or
indemnification agreement that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.8 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

 



 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Acknowledgement_. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a "change of
control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of each of the Employee Plans,
as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) _Existing Arrangements_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all of the Employee Plans and compensation and severance arrangements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, but subject to Section 6.9(c),
nothing will require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof to continue any Employee Plan, Company Plan or Comparable Plan or
prohibit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any such plans in accordance with their terms or if otherwise
required pursuant to applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Employment; Benefits_. The Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of
its Subsidiaries to) continue the employment of all employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time by taking such actions, if any,
as are required by applicable Law. For a period of one year following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either
(i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Employee Plans
(other than equity-based benefits, including for all purposes of this Section
6.9(c) under the ESPP, and, subject to Section 6.9(b), individual employment
agreements) of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the "
**Company Plans** ") at benefit levels that are, in the aggregate, no less
than those in effect at the Company or its applicable Subsidiaries on the date
of this Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits (including for all
purposes of this Section 6.9(c), vacation and paid time off benefits) to each
Continuing Employee pursuant to such Company Plans; (ii) provide compensation,
benefits and severance payments and benefits (other than equity-based benefits
and, subject to Section 6.9(b), individual employment agreements) to each
Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than
equity-based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (" **Comparable
Plans** "); or (iii) provide some combination of Company Plans and Comparable

 



      
 

 



 

Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation, benefits and
severance payments (other than equity-based benefits and, subject to Section
6.9(b), individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance
payments and benefits (other than equity-based benefits and individual
employment agreements) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time. In each case, base compensation and target incentive
compensation opportunity will not be decreased for a period of one year
following the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that
period except in the ordinary course of business consistent with the Companys
past practice. For Continuing Employees who terminate employment during the
one-year period following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide severance
payments and benefits to eligible employees in accordance with the Companys
severance plans, guidelines and practices as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) _New Plans_. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made
available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time, other
than with respect to the New Plans listed on Section 6.9(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to
be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility
to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement, but excluding for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined
benefit pension plan or post-employment welfare plan), except that such
service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication
of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans
sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company Plans) (such plans, the " **New Plans** ") to the extent that coverage
pursuant to any such New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable
Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before
the Effective Time (such plans, the " **Old Plans** "); (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability
benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation will cause all
waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to
the extent waived under the corresponding Old Plan, and the Surviving
Corporation will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit
pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, to the
extent credited under the corresponding Old Plan; and (iii) credit the
accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a
flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such
Continuing Employee. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time in accordance with the Companys vacation or paid time off
policies in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this Section 6.9 will not be deemed to
(i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii)
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time, so long as the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries comply with the second sentence of
Section 6.9(c) above; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in
any Person.

 



 

6.10 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either of
them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements
and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Notification by the Company_. At all times during the period commencing
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII
and the Effective Time, the Company will give prompt notice to Parent upon

Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied
at the Closing, except that no such notification will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to
any information provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.11(a).

 



 

(b) _Notification by Parent_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier

Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that
such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any
of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger
set forth in

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing,

or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger
or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided
to the Company pursuant to this Section 6.11(b).

 



 

6.12 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning
this Agreement and the Merger will be a joint press release reasonably

Company Board has made a Company Board Recommendation Change) will consult
with Parent before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b) engaging in
any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or other similar
Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are public or are reasonably
likely to become public, in any such case to the extent relating to the
Merger, except that the Company will not be obligated to engage in such
consultation with respect to communications that are required by applicable
Law, regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement. Except as
required by applicable Law, regulation, stock exchange rule or listing
agreement, Parent and the Company will not issue any subsequent press release
concerning this Agreement or the Merger without the other Partys consent.

 



 

6.13 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
provide Parent with prompt notice of all Transaction Litigation (including by
providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company will (a)
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or
prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Parent with
respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation and will consider in good faith Parents advice with respect to
such Transaction Litigation. The Company may not compromise, settle or come to
an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented
thereto in writing.

 



 

6.14 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to
applicable Law and the rules and regulations of NYSE to cause (a) the
delisting of the Company Common Stock from NYSE as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time; and (b) the deregistration of the Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such
delisting.

 



 

6.15 _Additional Agreements_. If at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of
the Company or Merger Sub, then the proper officers and directors of each
Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to take
the actions set forth on Section 6.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



      
 

 



 

6.16 _Convertible Notes; Call Options and Warrants._

 



 

(a) _Convertible Notes_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
all actions necessary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, dated as
of November 12, 2014, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association
(the " **Trustee** ") (as amended or supplemented prior to the date of this
Agreement, the " **Notes Indenture** "), including the giving of any notices
that may be required in connection with any repurchases or conversions of the
Convertible Notes occurring as a result of the Merger constituting a
Fundamental Change (as defined therein) and otherwise reasonably requested by
Parent in relation to any action or event that is required by or pursuant to
the Notes Indenture.

 



 

(b) _Notifications under Notes Indenture_. The Company shall provide Parent

or it counsel with respect thereto prior to the dispatch or making thereof.

 



 

(c) _Repurchase Transaction_. In connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, in the event that Parent desires to consummate a repurchase
offer or similar transaction with respect to any or all of the Convertible
Notes (any such transaction, a " **Repurchase Transaction** "), each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to, and will use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives (and, in the case of the
Company, the Trustee under the Notes Indenture) to, cooperate with one another
in good faith to permit such Repurchase Transaction to be effected on such
terms, conditions and timing as reasonably requested by Parent, including if
so requested by Parent, causing such Repurchase Transaction to be consummated
substantially concurrently with, but not prior to, the Closing; it being
understood that in no event shall the Company be required to prepare or
commence any documentation for any offer to purchase (including any tender
offer) that will result in a Repurchase Transaction with an effective date on
or prior to the Closing Date or incur any other cost or expense in connection
with such offer to purchase unless Parent agrees to reimburse the Company for
all costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith.

consultants and advisors, including legal and accounting advisors, to take all
actions reasonably requested by Parent in connection with making elections
under, amending, obtaining waivers, and/or unwinding of or otherwise settling
the Warrants and the Call Options. For the avoidance of doubt, unless
otherwise required by any Call Option or Warrant, nothing in this Section
6.16(d) shall be interpreted as an independent requirement for the Company to
terminate any Call Option or Warrant or make any termination payment
thereunder to any Hedge Counterparty prior to the Effective Time. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Parent at Parents reasonable request in connection with

 



      
 

 



 

any, and at Parents reasonable request shall use its reasonable best efforts
to initiate or continue, reasonable discussions or reasonable negotiations
with the counterparties to the Call Options or the Warrants or any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person, in each case, to the extent such
Affiliate or other Person expressly represents the interests of the
counterparties to the Call Options or the Warrants or is empowered to make any
determinations, adjustments or computations under the Call Options or the
Warrants (any such counterparty, Affiliate or Person, a "Hedge Counterparty"),
with respect to any determination, adjustment or computation in connection
with the Call Options or the Warrants, including with respect to any cash
amounts or shares of Company Common Stock that may be receivable, issuable,
deliverable or payable by the Company pursuant to the Call Options or the
Warrants (including upon termination thereof). The Company shall promptly
provide Parent with any written notices or other documents received from any
Hedge Counterparty with respect to any determination, adjustment or
computation under, or in connection with any discussions or negotiations
related to, the Call Options or Warrants. The Company shall not, and shall
cause its Representatives not to, enter into any agreements in respect of the
Call Options or the Warrants or make any elections or make any cash payments
or share deliveries with respect to the Call Options or the Warrants without
Parents prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, except as required pursuant to the terms thereof (as in effect on
the date of this Agreement) and shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep
Parent fully informed of all such discussions and negotiations and shall give
Parent the option to participate (or have its counsel participate) in any such
discussions and negotiations. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written response to any
written notice or other document received from any Hedge Counterparty with
respect to any determination, adjustment or computation under, or in
connection with any discussions or negotiations related to, the Call Options
or the Warrants prior to making any such response, and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly respond to any reasonable questions
from, and reflect any reasonable comments made by, Parent or its counsel with
respect thereto prior to making any such response.

 



 

(e) _Taking of Certain Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time and without
limitation to the other provisions of this Section 6.16, the Company shall
take all such actions as may be required in accordance with, and subject to,
the terms of the applicable Call Options and Warrants, including the giving of
any written notices or communication that may be required in connection with
the Merger and/or any conversions and/or repurchases of the Convertible Notes
or any adjustment to the Conversion Rate thereunder or occurring as a result
of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide Parent and its
counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such written
notice or communication prior to the dispatch or making thereof, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly respond to any
reasonable questions from, and reflect any reasonable comments made by, Parent
or its counsel with respect thereto prior to the dispatch or making thereof.

 



 

(f) _Defined Terms_. Capitalized term in this Section 6.16 that are not
otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meaning given to them in the
Notes Indenture.

Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will

material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other

the Company will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement prior to the

Company has complied with Section 5.3 with respect to such Superior Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

8.2 _Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

Section 8.1 (other than pursuant to Section 8.1(a)) must deliver prompt

the provision of Section 8.1 pursuant to which this Agreement is being
terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the basis for such
termination pursuant to such provision.

 



 

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 will be effective immediately upon the
delivery of written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. In
the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party
(or any partner, member, stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate,
agent or other representative of such Party) to the other Parties, as
applicable, except that Section 6.12, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and
Article IX will each survive the termination of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will relieve any
Party from any liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, "willful breach" means a material breach that is a
consequence of an act taken by the breaching party, or the failure by the
breaching party to take an act it is required to take under this Agreement, in
each case with actual knowledge that the taking of, or the failure to take,
such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this
Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement will
affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement, which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.

 



 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger will be paid by the
Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is
consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. In the
event that the Merger is consummated, Parent will pay or cause to be paid all
of the Parties (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii)
sales, use, gains, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees
arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger.

 



 

(b) _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) _Future Transaction_. If (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(e); (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) an
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise received by the
Company; and (C) within one year of the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(e), either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the
Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of
an Acquisition Transaction, then the Company will promptly (and in any event
within two Business Days) after the earlier of the (1) entry into such
definitive agreement or (2) consummation of such Acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

Transaction pay to Parent (or its designee) an amount equal to $725,000,000
(the " **Termination Fee** ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. For purposes of
this Section 8.3(b)(i), all references to "15%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



 

(ii) _Company Board Recommendation Change_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(f), then the Company will promptly (and in any event
within two Business Days) following such termination pay to Parent (or its
designee) the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

 



 

(iii) _Superior Proposal; Failure to Obtain Requisite Stockholder Approval_.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(h),
then the Company will concurrently with such termination pay or cause to be
paid to Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

 



 

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event
will the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and
upon the occurrence of different events.

 



 

(d) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Merger, and that, without
these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
Section 8.3(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set
forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof the Company will pay to Parent
its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection
with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the annual rate of the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was
required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was
actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Sole Remedy_. Parents receipt of the Termination Fee to the extent owed
pursuant to Section 8.3(b), will be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of
Parent and Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates against (A) the
Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates; and (B) the
former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of
the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates
(collectively, the " **Company Related Parties** ") in respect of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon payment of such
amount, none of the Company Related Parties will have any further monetary
liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (except, for the
avoidance of doubt, that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain
obligated with respect to, and the Parties may be entitled to remedies with
respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(d),
as applicable).

 



      
 

 



 

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other provisions
of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board
(or a committee thereof)), except that in the event that the Company has
received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made to this
Agreement that requires the approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to
the DGCL without such approval.

 



 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party may, to the extent legally allowed and except as
otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, as applicable; (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) subject
to the requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. Any delay
in exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a
waiver of such right.

economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

9.8 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any
Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) they will
be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; and (B) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

 



 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware.

 



 

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (a) irrevocably consents
to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether
inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any
Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger, for and on behalf of itself or any of
its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this Section 9.10
will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and
submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event that any
dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the Merger; (c) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any Chosen Court; (d) agrees that any
Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement or the Merger will
be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (e) waives any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal
Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought in
an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f)
agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement
or the Merger in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any

 



      
 

 



 

Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Law.

 



 

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.11.

 



 

9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an " **Electronic
Delivery** "), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original
executed counterpart and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
No Party may raise the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature,
or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

 



 

9.13 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent
possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and
closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and
that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this
Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set
forth in any provision herein will (except to the extent expressly stated) in
any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other
provision hereof.
