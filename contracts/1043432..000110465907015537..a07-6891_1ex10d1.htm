2.2 _Payment at the Closing_.

  

(a) _Payments by the Purchasers_. At the Closing, the Purchasers shall pay
the Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to ASC.

  

(b) _Payments by the Sellers_. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Sellers

2.3 _Income Adjustment and Working Capital Adjustments_. The Purchase Price

(a) _Income Adjustment_. The " _Purchase Price Income Adjustment_ " shall
mean the amount calculated by subtracting the aggregate Unleveraged Cash Flow
from and including October 30, 2006 to the close of business on the day
preceding the Closing Date from the aggregate Income Accretion Amount from
and including October 30, 2006 to the Closing Date. No later than the fourth
Business Day prior to the close of business on the day preceding the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the Purchasers an officers
certificate, certifying as to the estimated Purchase Price Income Adjustment
as of the Sunday prior to the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Income
Adjustment Amount_ "), which certificate shall be accompanied by a statement

Accretion Amount of the Company from and including October 30, 2006 through
the Sunday prior to the Closing Date, to be prepared from the books and
records of the Company in accordance with GAAP, where applicable, and in a
manner consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements;
_provided_ , that for purposes of the Estimated Income Adjustment Amount, the
Unleveraged Cash Flow for the week ending on the Sunday prior to the Closing
Date shall be the projected Unleveraged Cash Flow for such period as set
forth on _Exhibit 2.3(a)_ attached hereto. A representative calculation of the
Estimated Income Adjustment Amount is attached hereto as _Exhibit 2.3(a)_.
The Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be increased or decreased, on
a dollar for dollar basis, by the Estimated Income Adjustment Amount.

  

(b) _Working Capital Adjustment_. No later than the fourth Business Day
prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to the
Purchasers an officers certificate, certifying as to the estimated Working
Capital as of the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date
(the " _Estimated Working Capital Amount_ "), which certificate shall be
accompanied by a statement of the Estimated Working Capital Amount prepared
from the books and records of the Company in accordance with GAAP and in a
manner consistent with the preparation of the Financial Statements. The
Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall be increased, on a dollar for
dollar basis, to the extent the Estimated Working Capital Amount is greater
than negative $4,000,000.00, or decreased on a dollar for dollar basis, to
the extent the Estimated Working Capital Amount is less than negative
$4,000,000.00.

  

(c) As soon as practicable, but in any event within 90 days after the Closing
Date, the Purchasers shall cause to be prepared and delivered to ASC a
statement (the " _Final Adjustment Certificate_ ") certifying the amount of
Companys Working Capital as of the close of business on the day preceding

pursuant to Section 2.3(f).

        



  

(d) Upon receipt of the Final Adjustment Certificate, ASC shall have the
right during the succeeding 30-day period (the " _Review Period_ ") to
examine the Final Adjustment Certificate, and all books and records used to
prepare such Final Adjustment Certificate. If ASC disagrees with the
Purchasers determination of the Final Working Capital Amount or Final Income
Adjustment Amount, it shall so notify the Purchasers in writing (such notice,
a " _Disagreement Notice_ ") on or before the last day of the Review Period,
which Disagreement Notice shall set forth a specific description of
ASCs disagreement and the amount of the adjustment to the Final Working
Capital Amount or Final Income Adjustment Amount which ASC believes should
be made. If no Disagreement Notice is delivered within the Review Period,
the Final Adjustment Certificate shall be deemed to have been accepted by the
parties hereto. The Purchasers will, and will cause the Company to, provide
ASC full access (during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice) to
the books, ledgers, files, reports and operating records of the Company and
the then current employees of the Company, and cooperate and assist ASC in
evaluating the Final Adjustment Certificate.

  

(e) _Dispute Resolution_.

  

(i) In the event that a Disagreement Notice is delivered in accordance with
Section 2.3(d), the Purchasers and ASC shall attempt to resolve the
objections set forth therein within 30 days of receipt of such Disagreement
Notice. The objections set forth in the Disagreement Notice that are resolved
by the Purchasers and ASC in accordance with this Section 2.3(e)(i) shall
collectively be referred to herein as the " _Resolved Objections_." The Final
Working Capital Amount and the Final Income Adjustment Amount shall be
adjusted to reflect any Resolved Objections.

  

(ii) If the Purchasers and ASC are unable to resolve all the objections set
forth in the Disagreement Notice within such 30-day period, they shall
jointly appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers (or any other major accounting firm
mutually agreed upon by ASC and the Parent) within five days of the end of
such 30-day period (the " _CPA Firm_ "). The CPA Firm, acting as experts and
not as arbitrators, shall review the objections set forth in the Disagreement
Notice that are not Resolved Objections (collectively, the " _Differences_ ").
The CPA Firm shall determine, based on the requirements set forth in this
Section 2.3 and only with respect to Differences submitted to the CPA Firm,
whether and to what extent the Final Working Capital Amount and the Final
Income Adjustment Amount requires adjustment so as to be calculated in
accordance with this Agreement.  The CPA Firm shall be instructed to make its
determination within 15 days after its appointment. The fees
and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be borne by ASC and the Purchasers as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of each in connection with
the disputed items. The Purchasers and ASC shall, and the Purchasers shall
cause the Company to, provide to the CPA Firm full cooperation. The CPA
Firms resolution of the Differences shall be conclusive and binding upon the
parties, except in the case of manifest error.  The Differences as resolved
by the CPA Firm in accordance with this Section 2.3(e)(ii) shall collectively
be referred to herein as the " _CPA-Determined_

        



  

 _Differences_."  The Final Working Capital Amount and the Final Income
Adjustment Amount shall be adjusted to reflect any CPA-Determined
Differences.

  

(f) To the extent that the Final Working Capital Amount or Final Income
Adjustment Amount set forth in the Final Adjustment Certificate (as adjusted
in accordance with any Resolved Objections and CPA-Determined Differences)
differs from the Estimated Working Capital Amount or Estimated Income
Adjustment Amount, respectively, the adjustment to the Purchase Price
initially made pursuant to Sections 2.3(a) and 2.3(b) shall be recalculated
by the parties in accordance with Sections 2.3(a) and 2.3(b) by using the
Final Working Capital Amount or Final Income Adjustment Amount, in lieu of
the Estimated Working Capital Amount or Estimated Income Adjustment Amount,
respectively.

  

(g) On the fifth day following (or, if not a Business Day, on the next
Business Day) the latest to occur of (x) the 30th day following receipt by
ASC of the Final Adjustment Certificate, (y) the resolution by the Purchasers
and ASC of all objections set forth in the Disagreement Notice, if any, and
(z) the resolution by the CPA Firm of all Differences, if any, the
recalculation required by Section 2.3(f) shall be made and the Purchasers
shall pay to ASC the amount of any increase in the Purchase Price beyond that
received by ASC at the Closing, or ASC shall return to the Purchasers the
excess amount of the Purchase Price initially received by ASC at the Closing,
in each case together with all interest thereon at an annual rate equal to
the Prime Rate from the Closing Date until the date paid pursuant to this
Section 2.3. Such payment shall be made (i) in the case of a payment to the
Purchasers, by ASC by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account or accounts designated by the Purchasers and (ii) in the case of a
payment to ASC, by the Purchasers by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a bank account or accounts designated by ASC.

Affiliates with a third party, the parties will cooperate with each other to
cause the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to directly

provisions which relate to such contracts with ASC and/or one or more of its
Affiliate(s). Prior to the Closing Date, ASC, and following the Closing Date,
the Purchasers, shall use their commercially reasonably efforts to cause the
third party(ies) to each contract with ASC and/or one or more of its
Affiliates (excluding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) which have
cross-default or cross-termination provisions referring to one or
more contracts between such third party and/or one or more of its
Affiliate(s), and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to agree to the
removal from such contract of the cross-default or cross-termination
provisions which relate to such contracts with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

suits, damages, civil and criminal penalties and fines, costs and expenses,
Taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deficiencies, assessments, charges,

arising out of any one or more of the following:

  

(a) any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by the
Sellers in Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4 (without giving effect to any
qualifications as to Knowledge, materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualifications contained in such representations or warranties);

  

(b) any breach by ASC of any covenant to be performed or complied with by ASC
in this Agreement; or

  

(c) any liability related to the failure of the Sellers to pay in full any

Broker in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby.

  

10.3 _Indemnification by the Purchasers_. Subject to the terms and limitations
set forth herein, the Purchasers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify,

(not including, following the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), and
each of the respective past, present and future directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, agents and Representatives of ASC and such

any one or more of the following:

   

48  

   



  

(a) any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by the
Purchasers in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 (without giving effect to any

with by the Purchasers in this Agreement or any breach by the Company or its

10.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

  

(a) To the extent that a party hereto shall have any obligation to indemnify
and hold harmless any other Person hereunder, such obligation shall not
include lost profits or other consequential, special, punitive, incidental or
indirect damages (and the injured party shall not recover for such amounts),
except to the extent such amounts are required to be paid to a third party
other than an Indemnified Party or a Person affiliated therewith.

  

(b) The amount of any loss, liability, cost or expense for which
indemnification is provided under this Article X shall be net of any amounts
actually recovered by a Purchaser Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee, as the
case may be, under an insurance policy with respect to such loss, liability,
cost or expenses.

  

(c) Except as provided in Article XI and except for fraud, from and after the

herein or (b) otherwise with respect to this Agreement, the Company and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and matters arising out of,
relating to or resulting from the subject matter of this Agreement, whether
based on statute, contract, tort, property or otherwise, and whether or not
arising from the relevant partys sole, joint or concurrent negligence,
strict liability or other fault.

  

 **ARTICLE XI 
  
 TAX MATTERS**

  

11.1 _Tax Indemnification_.

  

(a) Subject to Section 13.3, from and after the Closing Date, ASC (for
purposes of this Article XI only, the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ "), shall
be responsible for, shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchasers and the Company and
reimburse the Purchasers and the Company for the following Taxes, to the
extent

        



  

that such Taxes have not been paid as of the Closing Date and are not
reflected in the determination of Working Capital: (i) all Taxes imposed on
the Company or the Purchasers as a result of the operations of the Company
with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing
Date; (ii) with respect to taxable years or periods beginning before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date, all Taxes imposed on the
Company or the Purchasers as a result of the operations of the Company, which
Taxes are allocable to the portion of such taxable year or period ending on
the Closing Date (an " _Interim Period_ ") (Interim Periods and any taxable
years or periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date being referred to
collectively hereinafter as " _Pre-Closing Periods_ "); (iii) Taxes of any
member of any affiliated group of corporations (as defined in Section 1504 of
the Code) with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries files or has
filed a Tax Return on a consolidated, combined, affiliated, unitary or
similar basis for a taxable year or period beginning before the Closing Date;
(iv) Taxes or other costs of the Purchaser Indemnities payable as a result of
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made in Section
3.17 of this Agreement or any breach of any covenant contained in this
Article XI, without duplication; and (v) any Taxes or other payments required
to be made after the Closing Date by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to any Person under any Tax sharing, indemnity or allocation agreement or
other arrangement in effect prior to the Closing (whether or not written)
with respect to a Pre-Closing Period.

  

(b) For purposes of this Section 11.1, in order to apportion appropriately
any Taxes relating to any taxable year or period that includes an Interim
Period, the parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted under applicable
law, elect with the relevant Tax authority to treat for all purposes the
Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of the Company. In
any case where applicable law does not permit the Company to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period, then, in each
such case, the portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the
Interim Period ending on the Closing Date shall be: (i) in the case of Taxes
that are based upon or related to income or receipts, deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the taxable year or period ended on the
Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph (i)
above that are imposed on a periodic basis, deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the Interim Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant period.

  

(c) Subject to Section 11.5 and the limitations contained in Section 11.3(b),
payment of any amount by the Tax Indemnifying Party under this Section 11.1
shall be made within ten (10) days following written notice by the Buyer or
the Company to ASC that the Company is required to pay such amounts to the
appropriate Tax authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Tax Indemnifying
Party shall not be required to make any payment to any Purchaser or the
Company hereunder earlier than five (5) Business Days before it is due to
the appropriate Tax authority.

        



  

(d) All matters relating in any manner to Tax indemnification obligations and
payments shall be governed exclusively by this Article XI except for
provisions regarding notice of claims, which shall be governed by Section
10.5.

  

11.2 _Tax Refunds_. The Purchasers shall pay to ASC all refunds or credits of
Taxes received by any Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and attributable to Taxes paid by the
Company or its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of the Company or
its Subsidiaries) with respect to a Pre-Closing Period, net of any Taxes
imposed on such refund amount, and adjusted to reflect any Tax benefit
received by the Purchasers or the Company in connection with the accrual or
payment of amounts pursuant to this Section 11.2, to the extent that such
refund or credit was not reflected in the Working Capital adjustment
contemplated by Section 2.3.

  

11.3 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

  

(a) ASC shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of (i) all income
Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Tax
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) all non-income Tax
Returns with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Tax period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, but only to the extent such Tax
Returns are required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date.  All such
Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent, in
all material respects, with the prior practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, prior Tax elections
and accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the Company and
its Subsidiaries), except as required by a change in the applicable Law
or regulations.

  

(b) The Purchasers shall prepare and timely file or cause the Company or
its Subsidiaries to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be
filed after the Closing Date other than Tax Returns described as the
responsibility of ASC in Section 11.3(a). All such Tax Returns with respect
to Pre-Closing Periods shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is
consistent, in all material respects, with the prior practice of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (including prior Tax elections and accounting methods or
conventions made or utilized by the Company or its Subsidiaries), except as
required by a change in the applicable Law or regulations. The Purchasers
shall deliver all such Tax Returns with respect to Pre-Closing Periods to ASC
for ASCs review at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date
(including extensions) of any such Tax Return. If ASC disputes any item
on such Tax Return, it shall notify the Purchasers of such disputed item
(or items) and the basis for its objection.  The parties shall act in good
faith to resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the Tax Return
is required to be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item, the
item in question shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to ASC and the Purchasers.  The fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be borne equally by ASC and the Purchasers.

  

(c) ASC shall deliver to Purchasers for their review any sales use, real
property, transfer or other non-income Tax Returns of the Company that are to
be filed on or prior to the Closing Date at least 45 days prior to the due
date (including extensions) of any such Tax Return or within 15 days after
the date hereof , whichever is later, provided that any such

        



  

Tax Return that is due within 15 days after the date hereof shall be
delivered to Purchasers as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If the
Purchasers dispute any item on a Tax Return delivered pursuant to the
preceding sentence, they shall notify ASC of such disputed item (or items)
and the basis for their objection. The parties shall act in good faith to
resolve any such dispute prior to the date on which the Tax Return
is required to be filed. If the parties cannot resolve any disputed item,
the item in question shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm
mutually acceptable to ASC and the Purchasers. The fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be borne equally by ASC and the Purchasers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 11.3(c) shall prevent
ASC or the Company from timely filing any Tax Returns that are due (including
extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date.

  

11.4 _Tax Cooperation_.

  

(a) For a period of seven years from and after the Closing, ASC and the
Purchasers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to
books and records), and assistance relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns,
for the preparation of any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding related to any proposed adjustment. Any
information obtained under this Section 11.4(a) shall be kept confidential,
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.
After the expiration of such seven-year period, the Purchasers or ASC, as the
case may be, may dispose of such information, books and records, provided
that prior to such disposition, (i) ASC shall give the Purchasers the
opportunity, at Purchasers expense, to take possession of such information,
books and records held by ASC; and (ii) the Purchasers shall give ASC the
opportunity, at ASCs expense, to take possession of such information, books
and records held by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

(b) The Purchasers agree that with respect to Pre-Closing Periods, they shall
not, on or after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of ASC,
amend any Tax Return (except as required by Law), or waive or extend any
statute of limitations with respect to any such Tax Return to the extent such
amendment or waiver would increase the Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period. ASC agrees that, with respect to
Pre-Closing Periods, it shall not, on or after the date hereof, without the
prior written consent of Purchasers, amend any Tax Return (except as required
by Law) of the Company or its Subsidiaries or the consolidated group of
corporations of which the Company or any Subsidiary is a member, or waive or
extend the statute of limitations with respect to any such Tax Return, to the
extent such amendment or waiver would increase the Taxes of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, or Purchaser in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
on or after the Closing Date..

  

11.5 _Tax Audits_.

  

(a) After the Closing, the Purchasers shall notify ASC in writing (a " _Tax
Notice_ ") of any demand or claim received by the Purchasers or the Company
from any Tax

        



  

authority or any other party with respect to Taxes for which the Tax
Indemnifying Party is liable pursuant to Section 11.1 within ten (10) days of
the receipt of such demand or claim by the Purchasers or the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a failure to give such Tax Notice will not
affect the rights of the Purchasers or the Company to indemnification under
Section 11.1 unless, or except to the extent that such failure precludes the
Tax Indemnifying Parties from contesting such demand or claim. Such Tax
Notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known) describing the
asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any
notice or other document received from any Tax authority in respect of any
such asserted Tax liability.

  

(b) Subject to the following sentence, ASC may elect to control the conduct,
through counsel chosen by ASC and reasonably acceptable to the Purchasers and
at ASCs own expense, of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or
judicial proceeding involving any asserted liability with respect to which
indemnity may be sought under Section 11.1, including any contest in respect
of an Interim Period (any such audit, claim for refund, or proceeding
relating to an asserted Tax liability is referred to herein as a " _Contest_
"). If ASC elects to control a Contest, ASC shall within thirty (30) calendar
days of receipt of the Tax Notice notify the Parent in writing of its intent
to do so; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchasers and the Company are
authorized to file any motion, answer or other pleading that may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect their interests during such 30
day period. If ASC properly elects to control a Contest, then ASC shall have
all rights to settle, compromise and/or concede such asserted liability and
the Purchasers shall cooperate and shall cause the Company (and any of its
successors) to cooperate in each phase of such Contest.  If ASC does not
elect to control the Contest, the Purchasers or the Company may, without
affecting its or any other indemnified partys rights to indemnification
under this Article XI, assume and control the defense of such Contest with
participation by the Sellers.

  

(c) In the event that a Contest involves an Interim Period (a "
_Straddle Contest_ "), the parties shall endeavor to cause the
Contest proceeding to be separated into two or more separate proceedings, one
of which shall involve exclusively the applicable Interim Period. In the
event that such separation cannot, after diligent efforts, be achieved, the
Purchasers and ASC shall jointly control the Straddle Contest; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, subject to this Section 11.5 generally, the Purchasers
shall have all rights to make decisions, settle, compromise and/or concede
such asserted liability as relates to the portion of the taxable period that
begins after the Closing Date, and ASC shall have all rights to settle,
compromise and/or concede such asserted liability as relates to the Interim
Period.

  

(d) With respect to a Contest that is described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of
this Section, and which relates to a method of accounting, a recurring item
of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit. Taxes other than income Taxes,
franchise Taxes, and Transfer and Recording Taxes, ASCs ability to settle,
compromise and/or concede any asserted liability shall be subject to the
Parents consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if
ASCs proposed settlement, compromise or concession would adversely affect
such Tax liability of the Company in a Post-Closing period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if the Parent does not provide ASC with such consent, and ASC
shall pay to the Parent the amount that ASC was willing to pay the

        



  

Taxing authority to settle the asserted Tax liability, ASC shall be released
by the Parent from all indemnification obligations thereto pursuant to
Section 11.1 and the Parent shall assume control over the conduct of such
Contest and shall have all rights if such Contest does not involve any issues
for which ASC remains liable under this Article XI to make decisions, settle,
compromise, and/or concede such asserted liability.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11.5 to the contrary,
none of the Purchasers or the Company shall be required to permit ASC to
contest any claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Tax Indemnifying
Parties shall have no obligation to pay, indemnify or reimburse the
Purchasers or the Company for any amounts that the Purchasers or the Company
pay without the prior approval of ASC (which may not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed if the related indemnification obligation does not have a material
economic impact on ASC or the Indemnifying Parties) with respect to a claim
ASC timely elects to contest but is not permitted to contest under this
Section 11.5(e).

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11.5 to the contrary,
ASC shall not, without the prior written consent of the Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, contained or delayed), settle, compromise
or concede any asserted liability unless ASC has (i) paid or otherwise
satisfied the asserted liability on or prior to the date of such settlement,
compromise or concession, or (ii) obtained, as an unconditional term of such
settlement, compromise or concession, an unconditional release, issued by the
applicable taxing authority in favor of the Company, for all responsibility
in respect of the asserted liability.

  

11.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payment_. The parties agree to
treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

  

11.7 _338(h)(10) Election_.

  

(a) _Section 338(h)(10) Election; Allocation of "Adjusted Grossed-Up Basis_."
If requested by the Purchasers, ASC and the Purchasers shall elect under
section 338(h)(10) of the Code to treat the sale of the Stock as a sale by
the Company and its Subsidiaries of all of their respective assets (the "
_Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") and shall make any such available election
under any substantially similar state or local law, if requested by the
Purchasers. The making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election shall not increase
the Purchase Price. Subject to Section 13.3, ASC shall pay any Tax associated
with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and any analogous election made under
state or local law. As requested by the Purchasers, ASC shall take such
actions as the Purchasers deem necessary to effect the Section 338(h)(10)
Election (including, without limitation, the timely filing of Internal
Revenue Service Form 8023 (Corporate Qualified Stock Purchase Elections)).

  

(b) _Allocation_. On or before the date that is 30 days after the Closing
Date, the Purchasers shall provide to ASC a proposed allocation of the
Purchase Price for the deemed sale of assets resulting from the making of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election, setting forth the

        



  

estimated fair market values of the assets of each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. On or before the date that is 60 days after the Closing Date,
ASC and the Purchasers shall cooperate in developing and agree upon a final
allocation of such Purchase Price (the " _Final Allocation_ "). ASC and the
Purchasers shall cooperate in developing the Final Allocation.

  

(c) _Forms_. On or before the date that is ten days before the Closing Date,
ASC shall provide to the Purchasers drafts of all forms, together with all
drafts of required attachments thereto, other than allocation of the Purchase
Price, required for making the Section 338(h)(10) Election and any such
available election under any substantially similar state or local law if
requested by the Purchasers (the " _Election Forms_ "). On the Closing Date,
ASC shall deliver to the Purchasers the Election Forms, properly executed by
ASC. ASC and the Purchasers shall cooperate in drafting and making final the
Election Forms.  If the parties have not reached agreement with respect to
the allocation schedule, then the dispute shall be presented to an
independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Purchasers and ASC,
whose determination shall be binding on both parties. The fees and expenses
of such accounting firm shall be paid one-half by the Buyer and one-half by
ASC. ASC shall be responsible for filing the Election Forms with the proper
taxing authorities, provided that the Parent or the Buyer, as the case may
be, shall be responsible for filing any Election Form that must be filed with
its Tax Returns.

  

(d) _Modification; Revocation_. The Purchasers and ASC each agree that it
shall not, and shall not permit any of its respective Affiliates to, take any
action to modify the Election Forms following the execution thereof, or to
modify or revoke the Section 338(h)(10) Election, or any such available
election under any substantially similar state or local law if requested by
the Purchasers, following the filing of the Election Forms, without the
written consent of the Purchasers or ASC, as the case may be.

  

(e) _Consistent Treatment_. The Purchasers and ASC shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the information contained in the Election Forms as filed and the Final
Allocation, unless otherwise required because of a change in applicable tax
law.

  

(f) _Expenses Resulting from Section 338(h)(10) Elections_. The Purchasers
and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and ASC and its Affiliates, on the
other hand, shall bear their respective administrative, legal and similar
expenses resulting from the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election and any
such available elections under any substantially similar state or local law
if requested by the Purchasers.

  

11.8 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax sharing agreements or arrangements
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or may have
any liability or obligation shall be terminated effective as of the Closing.
After the Closing, this Agreement shall be the sole Tax sharing agreement
relating to the Company or any Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

        



  

11.9 _Survival of Obligations_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the obligations of the parties set forth in this Article XI
shall remain in effect until the expiration of the applicable statutes of
limitations (including valid extensions thereof).

  

 **ARTICLE XII

12.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

Governmental Authorities under the HSR Act;

  

(d) upon written notice by the Sellers, on the one hand, or by the
Purchasers, on the other hand, to the other party if the other party (being
any of the Sellers or the Purchasers) is in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder (which breach
continues unremedied by such party for thirty (30) days after written notice
thereof to such party); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such other party is
any Purchaser, it shall not be entitled to such 30-day period if it is in
default of its obligation to pay the Purchase Price to the Sellers on the
Closing Date as provided herein; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that (i) if
any Seller is seeking termination, then no Seller is then in breach in any

code format) and technical and user documentation and materials related to
such programs, including without limitation the software, documentation and
materials described on _Exhibit A_  (collectively, " _CORIS_ "); and (2) a
work request and management system that is comprised of certain computer
software programs (in source and object code format) and technical and user
documentation and materials related to such programs, including without
limitation the software, documentation and materials described on _Exhibit A_

  , 2006 by and between XYZ and Licensee (the " _SPA_ "), XYZ purchased
from Licensee all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of
SSRC; and

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the SPA, XYZ agreed to grant Licensee a license to use
CORIS and WRMS on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  

NOW THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing, the agreements and
undertakings hereinafter provided and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby expressly
acknowledged by Licensor and Licensee, Licensor and Licensee hereby agree as
follows:

  

# **1. _LICENSE GRANT_.**

  

## (a) _License_. Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a worldwide,
nonexclusive, non-assignable (except to the limited extent set forth in
Section 11(b) hereof), nontransferable, sub-licensable (as permitted
in Section 1(c) below), royalty-free, fully-paid license to make, use,
modify, translate, reverse engineer, reproduce, decompile, disassemble,
create derivative works based on, copy, display and/or merge into another
program or programs in whole or in part CORIS and WRMS, including without
limitation the Enhancements provided to Licensee under Section 3 below
(including all source code, object code and documentation related thereto)
(collectively, the "Software"). The rights granted to Licensee pursuant to
this Section 1(a), collectively referred to herein as the "License."

  

## (b) _Restriction; Remote Access_. Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, the Licensee shall only be permitted to use the Software at the
resorts or related facilities owned and/or operated by Licensee or its
subsidiaries as of the Effective Date (as defined in Section 4 below), and as
listed in Exhibit C (such resorts or related facilities, the
"Licensed Resorts"). For the purposes of the Maintenance and Support
Services (as defined below), Licensee shall provide     

## Licensor and Licensors employees, agents, and independent
contractors with remote access to the Software as installed at the processing
units at any and all of the Licensed Resorts.

  

(c) _Sublicense Rights_. Licensee may sublicense any and all of the rights
included in the License to any and all of its subsidiaries that own and/or
control the Licensed Resorts (as defined herein), _provided that_ Licensees
rights in the source code of the Software shall not be sublicensed or
otherwise transferred by Licensee to any party (including Licensees
subsidiaries, the Licensed Resorts, and Licensees agents and independent
contractors) so long as Maintenance and Support Services are being provided
hereunder, or otherwise in conjunction with Licensees enhancement of the
Software. In the event that Licensee sells, conveys or otherwise transfers
its ownership of all (including without limitation in connection with an
asset sale), or substantially all of its direct or indirect equity interests
in, any of the Licensed Resorts, then the sublicense with respect to such
Licensed Resort(s) shall terminate, and Licensor shall enter into an
agreement with purchaser(s) of such Licensed Resort(s) on the same terms and
conditions as contained in this Agreement, except that Licensor shall have no
obligation to provide to the purchaser any services described in Section 3,
or to provide any right to sublicense the Software.

  

# **2. _OWNERSHIP AND USE OF SOFTWARE_**

  

## (a) _Ownership and Use of Software; Confidentiality_.  Licensee
acknowledges that the Software is a commercially valuable proprietary product
and trade secret of Licensor, and that the Software (including but not
limited to the Softwares design, programming techniques, algorithms and
codes) is regarded by Licensor as secret and confidential. Licensee agrees not
to disclose any portion of the Software to unauthorized persons, whether or
not such portion is or may be validly copyrighted or patented.  Licensee
shall treat all proprietary information related to the Software of the
Licensor, and the Software of Licensor, as confidential and shall safeguard
it to the same extent that the Licensee safeguards its own confidential
information but in any event in at least a reasonably prudent manner.
Licensees use of the Software shall comply with all applicable laws.
 Licensee agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
all those persons having access to the Software under this Agreement
shall observe and perform the obligation set forth in this Section. The terms
of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

## (b) _Ownership of Enhancements_. Each party shall be the sole and
exclusive owner throughout the world of any and all right, title and interest
in and to any and all (i) corrections, additions, enhancements, upgrades,
updates, corrections, and improvements of or to the Software (collectively, "
_Enhancements_ ") made by such party to the Software, and all derivative
works based thereon that are created by such party and (ii) copyright,
patent, trade secret and/or other intellectual property rights in and to any
and all such additions, modifications, improvements and derivative works. For
a period of 24 months from the Effective Date, in the event that either party
provides the other party with any Enhancements in accordance with Section
3(d) below, the provisions of the License will be extended to such
Enhancements, except that in the case of Enhancements provided by Licensee to
Licensor, Licensee shall be considered the "Licensor" hereunder, and vice
versa.

        

# **3. _MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT_.** The services described in Sections 3(a)
and 3(b) are referred to as the " _Maintenance and Support Services_ ".
Except as set forth in Sections 3(a), 3(b), and 3(d), neither party shall

the Software.

  

## (a) _Defects_.

  

### (i) " _Defect_ " means any material problem, defect, failure or other
error in the Software discovered by Licensor or reported to it by Licensee.
Defects include, without limitation, any failure of the Software to
materially perform any of the primary functions for which it was designed and
any material error in the Software such that it fails to operate in
substantial conformance with the corresponding documentation.

  

### (ii) _Defect Reports_. Licensee shall be entitled to submit to Licensor
written notice of a Defect (as defined below), which notice (a " _Defect
Report_ ") shall describe any Defects, identify the associated severity level
of the Defects and, to the extent readily available, give the Licensor
sufficient information to enable the Licensor to reproduce the Defects.
Defect Reports may be submitted in Licensees reasonable discretion via
e-mail, or fax, or other mutually acceptable means of communication.

  

### (iii) _Defect Correction_. After submission of a Defect Report, Licensor
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a correction for the
Defect in the Software (each, a " _Correction_ ") as follows:

  

#### (A) _Priority 1 Defects_. " _Priority 1 Defect_ " means a Defect that
causes any of the following occurrences: (A) substantial restrictions
on, substantial disruption of, or substantial adverse impact on Licensees
business operations making use of the Software; (B) inability to access or
use an important function of the Software; or (C) any errors resulting in
material data loss, data corruption, or inaccuracies in the Softwares output
or processing. Licensor shall (X) within one twenty-four (24) hours after
submission of the Defect Report, use commercially reasonable efforts to
assign fully qualified technicians to repair the Defect; (Y) use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide a workaround by the end of one (1) week; and
(Z) use commercially reasonable efforts to supply a Correction as soon as
possible.

  

#### (B) _Priority 2 Defects_. " _Priority 2 Defect_ " means a Defect that
is not a Priority 1 Defect and that causes (A) significant restrictions on,
significant disruption of, or significant adverse impact on Licensees
business operations making use of the Software; or (B) inability to access or
use a non-trivial function of the Software. Using commercially reasonable
efforts, Licensor shall (X) within one (1) week after submission of the
Defect Report, assign fully qualified technicians to repair the Defect; (Y)
provide a workaround within one (1) calendar month; and (Z) supply a
Correction as soon as possible.

  

#### (C) _Priority 3 Defects_. " _Priority 3 Defect_ " means any Defect that
is

        

#### neither a Priority 1 Defect nor a Priority 2 Defect. Licensor shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, within three (3) calendar weeks after
submission of the Defect Report, respond to the Defect Report by informing
Licensee how Licensor intends to correct the Defect (e.g., provide a
workaround, or provide a Correction).

  

## (b) _Support_. Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
support the operation and use of the Software by Licensee, including without
limitation by using commercially reasonable efforts to provide the services
described on _Exhibit B_ to this Agreement.

  

## (c) _Fees_.  Licensee shall, on a quarterly basis, pay to Licensor a fee
for all Maintenance and Support Services in an amount equal to a pro-rata
share (based on the number of reservation components included in all orders
placed by the Licensed Resorts compared to the total number of reservation
components placed through CORIS by the Licensed Resorts plus the Steamboat
ski resort) of the total costs of such Maintenance and Support Services.
Maintenance and Support Services shall be provided to any authorized
sublicensees on the same payment terms. Any fees for Maintenance and Support
Services with respect to Enhancements shall be governed by Section 3(d)
below.

  

## (d) _Provision of Enhancements_. Licensee shall be entitled to submit to
Licensor written requests for any desired Enhancements. Requests may be
submitted via e-mail, fax, or postal or courier service.  If the parties
mutually agree that any such Enhancement will be provided by Licensor, the
scheduling and payment terms regarding such Enhancement shall be negotiated
by the parties in good faith.  If Licensor completes any material
Enhancements, Licensee may request that Licensor provide to Licensee such
Enhancements, in object code, with updated documentation (if any), upon
scheduling and payment terms to be negotiated by the parties in good faith.
 If Licensee completes any Enhancements, Licensor may request that Licensee
provide to Licensor such Enhancements, in object code, with
updated documentation (if any), upon scheduling and payment terms to be
negotiated by the parties in good faith. Neither party shall have any
obligation to provide maintenance or support services with respect to
Enhancements made by the other party.

  

## (e) _Training_. Upon request of Licensee and for a fee to be negotiated in
good faith between the parties, Licensor shall provide training services to
designated employee(s) of Licensee with respect to installation or use of the
Software.

  

# **4. _TERM AND TERMINATION_.**

  

## (a) The " _Term_ " of this Agreement shall commence as of the closing date

unless terminated pursuant to this Section 4.

### (ii) _Maintenance and Support Services_. Licensor shall provide the
Maintenance and Support Services described in Section 3 for a period of
twenty-four (24) months.  Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, in
the case of any Licensed Resort for which Licensee is using a version of the
Software that Licensee modified without Licensors approval, Licensor may
terminate the Maintenance Services described in Section 3(a) and the Support
Services with respect to such Licensed Resort upon written notice.

  

## (c) _Termination by Licensee_. Licensee may terminate this Agreement,
including the License, as to any Licensed Resort at any time upon one hundred
eighty (180) days written notice to Licensor.

termination of this Agreement as it relates to all Licensed Resorts, Licensee
shall cease use, and destroy all copies, of the Software. Upon termination of
the Maintenance and Support Services, Licensor shall have no obligation to
provide any Maintenance and Support Services or training services. In the
event that the parties agree that Licensor shall provide additional
Maintenance and Support Services or training services after the initial
twenty-four (24) months, the terms for such services will be negotiated in
good faith by the parties.

  

# **5. _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_.** Licensor represents and warrants
to Licensee that it has the right to grant the License as set forth herein.

SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," AND LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY OR

contractor or others who might have incurred debts which could result in
mechanics liens;**

  

 **2. Information concerning the solvency and whereabouts of the parties set
forth in Item No. 1, possibly including financial statements;**

  

 **3. Evidence of payment of any bills which might have been incurred for
work done on the property, depending upon the length of time elapsed since
the last work was completed and what remains to be done;**

  

 **4. In the event of extensive recent construction, whether on all of the
improvements upon the property or not, additional items required may include:
 (a) the Companys review of the owners and/or builders history relative
to construction projects previously completed or presently
under construction; (b) review of the construction loan agreement, if
applicable; (c) review of any performance or materialmens bonds concerning
this construction, if applicable; (d) payment of the appropriate charge for

This is also to advise that, pursuant to Regulation of the Colorado Insurance
Commissioner, every title entity shall be responsible for all matters which
appear of record prior to the time of recording, and subsequent to the
effective date of the commitment, whenever the title entity conducts the
closing and is responsible for recording or filing of legal documents
resulting from the transaction which was closed. This does not include those
matters created, suffered, assumed or agreed to by the insured.  The
prospective insured is advised to inquire of the closing entity as to whether
it is an office of Transnation Title Insurance Company, or is an independent
agent which will be the responsible entity relative to the closing only.
