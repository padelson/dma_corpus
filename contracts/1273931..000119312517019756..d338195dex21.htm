NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the representations,

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1. _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company, whereupon
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue its corporate existence under the Laws of the State of Delaware

as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

1.2. _Closing of the Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties, at
the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York,

Business Day (or, if earlier, the Business Day immediately prior to the End
Date) after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) of the conditions (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions) set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_;  _provided_ , that if the
Required Information has not been provided by the Company at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), the
Closing shall occur on the earlier of (a) a date specified by Parent in
writing on no fewer than three (3) Business Days notice to the Company (it
being understood that such date may be conditioned upon the simultaneous
completion of the Debt Financing and, if the Debt Financing is not completed
for any reason at such time, such notice shall automatically be deemed
withdrawn) and (b) the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date the
Required Information is provided by the Company, provided that in each case of
(a) and (b) the Closing is subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) set forth in 
_Article_ __ _ VI_.. The date on which the Closing occurs is the " _Closing
Date._ "

 



\- 2 - 1.3. _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by executing, delivering and filing a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and other applicable Delaware Law and shall make such other filings
or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such
later time on the Closing Date as may be agreed by Parent and the Company and
specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (such time
as the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the " _Effective
Time_ ").

1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger

CONSIDERATION

2.1. _Effect on Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares (the " _Shares_
") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "
_Common Stock_ "):

(a) any Shares then held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall
be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation (the " _Converted Shares_ ");

(b) any Shares then held by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any entity of
which Merger Sub is a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary shall be
cancelled and retired and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "); and

(c) each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Dissenting Shares, Converted Shares or Cancelled Shares)
shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $13.25 in cash,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

2.2. _Effect on Preferred Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Series D Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "
_Series D Preferred Stock_ "), each share of Series D Preferred Stock shall be
cancelled and each holder of shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration such holder would have received had such holder, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, converted all of its shares of Series D Preferred
Stock into shares of Common Stock (without regard to any limitations
contained in the certificate of designation with respect to such Series D
Preferred Stock).

2.3.  _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Shares, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one share of common stock of the Surviving Company.

2.4. _Treatment of Company Options and Company RSUs_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") granted pursuant to the Companys 2005
Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended, restated, modified or supplemented from
time to time, the " _Company Stock Plan_ "), whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by Parent and the holder of such Company Option, shall
automatically be terminated at the Effective Time and converted into the right
of the holder thereof to receive, in full satisfaction of the Companys
obligations with respect to any such Company Option, as of the Effective Time,
an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price of such Company Option and (y) the number
(determined

 



\- 4 -  without reference to vesting requirements or other limitations on
exercisability) of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "). Any Company Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an exercise price
that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall expire upon
the Effective Time without being converted into the right to receive any
consideration in respect thereof.

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit representing the right
to receive one share of Common Stock, whether subject to performance-based
vesting requirements or time-based vesting requirements (each, a " _Company
RSU_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the holder of such
Company RSU, automatically be converted into a cash-settled long-term
incentive award (a " _Converted Award_ "), representing a right to receive an
amount of cash, without interest, equal to the per share Merger
Consideration, on the same vesting terms and conditions applicable to such
Company RSU immediately before the Effective Time. On the date, and to the
extent, that the Converted Award becomes vested, such vested Converted Award
shall be paid, subject to any applicable withholding taxes, as soon as
practicable thereafter (but in any event not later than the second regular
payroll date thereafter). The Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide for the foregoing actions.

2.5. _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any shares of
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and as to which the holders thereof have not voted in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and have properly demanded appraisal in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and have not effectively withdrawn
such demand (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __
_ 2.1_, and such holders shall be entitled only to such rights and
payments as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ ,
__ that if any such holder shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such
holders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, each of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, without interest and after giving effect to
any required Tax withholdings as provided herein, and such holder thereof
shall cease to have any other rights with respect thereto. At the Effective
Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and as
provided in the previous sentence.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written notices
received by the Company with respect to any intent to demand, or written
demands for, appraisal with respect to any shares of Common Stock, attempts to
withdraw such notices or demands and any other instruments or notices served
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law relating to
stockholders appraisal rights and (ii) the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law relating to
stockholders appraisal rights. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order of
a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, make any payment or other
commitment with respect to any such demands for appraisal, offer to settle or
settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 



\- 5 - 2.6. _Paying Agent_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company with the Companys
transfer agent or a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to
the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of Shares (other than Dissenting Shares, Converted Shares or Cancelled Shares)
and the Series D Preferred Stock cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to all Shares (other than
Dissenting Shares, Converted Shares or Cancelled Shares) and Series D
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. With
respect to any Dissenting Shares, Parent shall only be required to deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares if
the holder thereof fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its
right to dissent under the DGCL. The funds held by the Paying Agent shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
to the extent such funds are not sufficient to make the payments provided in
this _Article_ __ _ II_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the lost portion of such fund so
as to ensure that it is maintained at a level sufficient to make
such payments.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than
Dissenting Shares, Converted Shares or Cancelled Shares) or Series D Preferred
Stock that immediately prior to the Effective Time were evidenced by
certificates (the " _Certificates_ "): (i) a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with _Section 2.6(g)_ ) for exchange and cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Shares or Series D Preferred Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate and such Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit
of holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates.

(c) Any holder of record of Shares (other than Dissenting Shares, Converted
Shares or Cancelled Shares) or Series D Preferred Stock that immediately prior
to the Effective Time were not evidenced by certificates (the " _Book Entry
Shares_ ") shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or, unless
reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, an executed letter of transmittal to
the Paying Agent in order to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration with
respect to such Book Entry Shares, and as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall pay and deliver to each
holder of Book Entry Shares the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of
such Book Entry Shares, and such Book Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Book Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Book Entry
Shares.

 



\- 6 - (d) If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor or the registered holder of Book Entry Shares, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and
otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book Entry Shares shall be
properly transferred, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Paying Agent in advance any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

(e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Shares and of the Series D Preferred
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Paying Agent, they shall be (subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this _Article II_ ) cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article II_. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares and the holder of shares
of Series D Preferred Stock, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
and Series D Preferred Stock except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law.

(f) Any portion of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_ (including any interest or other proceeds of any
investment thereon) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be paid, at the request of
Parent, to Parent or as directed by Parent. Any stockholders of the Company
who have not theretofore complied with this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Common Stock held by such
stockholder at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, none of Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent or
any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Common
Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the
Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent or
the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

 



\- 7 - 2.7. _Withholding_. Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld
from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to the Merger such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payment under all
applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the recipient of the payment in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 

2.8. _Certain Adjustments_. Without limiting the obligations of the Company
under this Agreement (including  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_), if between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the number of Shares or the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise of
any issued and outstanding securities of the Company (including the Series D
Preferred Stock) are changed into a different number or a different class by
reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration and any other dependent items, as
applicable, shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted and as so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Merger
Consideration or other dependent item, as applicable.

respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and of any request by

response and shall include any such comments reasonably proposed by Parent.
Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company all information concerning
themselves, Guarantor, their respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be necessary to comply with

to the stockholders of the Company as of the record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting, in each case as promptly as practicable following the
date the SEC confirms it has no further comments to the preliminary Proxy

accordance with and subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
approval of the Merger and secure any other approval of stockholders of the
Company that is required by applicable Law in connection with the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Company may change the date of,
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting (but not to a date later

counsel), that such postponement or adjournment is necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Company Stockholders Meeting; and (B) the Company may (and if Parent so
requests, the Company shall on up to two occasions up to 10 Business Days
each), change the date of, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting (but not to a date later than the Business Day prior to the End Date
and provided that the Company shall not be required to set a new record date)
if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled (1)
there are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholders Meeting or (2) at such time the Company has not received
proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall keep Parent updated
with respect to proxy solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
and prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article_
__ _ VII_, the obligation of the Company to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and mail the definitive
Proxy Statement (and any amendment or supplement that may be required by Law)

Recommendation. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall not submit to
the vote of its stockholders any Company Acquisition Proposal other than the
Merger prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article_
__ _ VII_.

 



\- 38 - 5.4. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the date on which this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , the Company shall not, and
the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers,

enter into any letter of intent or other document or Contract requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder (any such letter of
intent or other document or Contract, an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "). The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and its and its Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees and
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations conducted with any persons other than Parent with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, including immediately revoking or
withdrawing access of any person other than Parent and its directors,
officers, employees and Representatives to any data room (virtual or actual)
containing any non-public information with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries previously furnished with respect to a Company Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall not terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which the Company
is a party, in each case, with respect to the submission of any Company
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_, prior
to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives receives an unsolicited
_bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ and the Company Board concludes in good
faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors) that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Superior Proposal, the Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its
and their directors, officers, employees and Representatives, to (i) enter
into and maintain discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) furnish non-public information and
afford access to the business, employees, officers, Contracts, properties,
assets, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
making such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A)
prior to providing (or causing to be provided) such information or affording
such access to, or entering into or maintaining such discussions
or negotiations with, such person, the Company shall have entered into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such person and (B) the Company will
provide to Parent any non-public information relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to
Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within one (1)
day) after providing (or causing to be provided) any such information to such
person making such Company Acquisition Proposal.

 



\- 39 - (c) The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing promptly (but in any
event within two (2) days) (i) after receipt of any Company Acquisition
Proposal (or any proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal), which notice shall
include the identity of the person making such proposal or offer, a summary
of the material terms of all such proposals or offers and copies of drafts of
proposed agreements, term sheets or letters of intent related thereto, (ii) of
any change to the financial or other material terms and conditions of any
Company Acquisition Proposal and the Company shall otherwise keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status of any such Company Acquisition Proposal
(including by providing copies of all proposals, offers and drafts
of proposed agreements related thereto that have not already been provided
pursuant to clause (i) above) and (iii) after receipt of any request for non-
public information relating to it or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to
its or any of its Subsidiaries properties, books or records by any person in
connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal (or any proposal or offer that
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition
Proposal). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the
date of this Agreement, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement
that would prohibit it from providing such information to Parent.

 

(d) Prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
Company Board may terminate this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
7.1(h)_ in order to enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect a
transaction constituting a Company Superior Proposal (and make a Change of
Recommendation with respect thereto), if and only if:

 

(i) the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach of  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ and the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors) that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal; 

(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Companys
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_ (a
" _Superior Proposal Notice_ "), which notice shall identify the person making
such Company Superior Proposal and include the material terms and conditions
of such Company Superior Proposal, including copies of any written proposals
or offers and any proposed agreements related thereto;

(iii) for at least four (4) Business Days after Parents receipt of such
Superior Proposal Notice (such minimum period, the " _Notice Period_ "), the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its financial and legal advisors (and
other Representatives) to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Acquisition Proposal ceases
to constitute a Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed
that any revision to the financial terms or any other material term

 



\- 40 -  of such Company Superior Proposal shall require a new Superior Proposal
Notice and the Company shall be required to comply again with the provisions
of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_ with respect to such new notice, except that
such Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Day (rather than four (4)
Business Days)); and

 

(iv) at the end of the period (or periods) referred to in clause (iii) above,
the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors) that such Company Acquisition
Proposal still constitutes a Company Superior Proposal after giving effect to
all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause
(iii) above and that a failure to terminate this Agreement in order to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

(e) Other than in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal (which shall
be subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_ and shall not be subject to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_), prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval
is obtained, the Company Board may make a Change of Recommendation if and only
if (i) prior to taking such action, the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors, that failure to take such action would inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; (ii) the
Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Companys intention to
make a Change of Recommendation (a " _Change of Recommendation Notice_ "),
which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for such Change
of Recommendation; (iii) for at least three (4) Business Days after Parents
receipt of a Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company has negotiated, and
has caused its financial and legal advisors (and other Representatives) to
negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement in such a manner that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation
would no longer be reasonably likely to be a violation of the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (iv) at the end of the period
referred to in clause (iii) above, the Company Board has concluded in good
faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors) that failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law after giving
effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to
clause (iii) above.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
Item promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Company Acquisition
Proposal (it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Company
Board of a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not in and of
itself constitute a Change of Recommendation) or (ii) making any disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal advisors) that the failure to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (including any legally required disclosure to
stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Company
Board expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take,

Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including as may be required
under any Money Transmitter Requirements, (iii) comply promptly with all Legal
Requirements which may be imposed on such party with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) defend all lawsuits or
other legal, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings to which it (or

subject to the final sentence of this _Section 5.5(a)_ , make such filings and
submissions as set forth on Section 5.5(a)(C) of the Company Disclosure

required by applicable Money Transmitter Requirements with respect to
obtaining Approvals related to Money Transmitter Licenses of the Company or
its Subsidiaries (the " _Money Transfer Change of Control Filings_ "), and (D)
make such filings contemplated by applicable foreign competition Laws as set
forth on Section 5.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules. With respect to

other related information pursuant to Section 721 of Title VII of the Defense
Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. § 4501 _et seq._ ) (the "
_Defense Production Act_ ") 

 



\- 42 -  as promptly as practicable, and to submit a final CFIUS Notice and other
related information pursuant to the Defense Production Act as promptly as

Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts and
cooperate with the other parties (a) in timely making inquiries
with Governmental Entities regarding the Money Transfer Change of Control
Filings, (b) in determining if any Money Transfer Change of Control Filings
are not required by Governmental Entities, and (c) in timely making all Money
Transfer Change of Control Filings (except with respect to such jurisdictions
where the parties agree that a Money Transfer Change of Control Filing is not
required).

 

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including those set
forth elsewhere in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (i) cooperate with
the other parties hereto and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to obtain as promptly as
practicable all Approvals of all third parties and Governmental Entities which
are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to all
Money Transfer Change of Control Filings required in accordance with Section
5.5(a)), (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
promptly inform the other party or parties of any substantive communication
(oral and written) received by such party from, or given by such party to,
any Governmental Entity with respect to any such filing or Approval or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including keeping the other
parties apprised, on a current basis of the status of such filing or
Approval, including the Money Transfer Change of Control Filings), and of any
substantive communication received or given in connection with any legal
proceeding by a private party regarding the Merger, (iii) to consult with the
other party or parties (subject to applicable Legal Requirements relating to
the exchange of information) in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party relating to proceedings with respect
to any such Approvals or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v)
to use reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other party or parties and,

(v) not independently participate in any meeting (including substantive
telephonic meetings) with any Governmental Entity in respect of any Approval

opportunity to attend and/or participate in such meeting (including
substantive telephonic meetings) and (vi) to use reasonable best efforts to
comply with the terms and conditions of all such Approvals of all such third
parties and Governmental Entities. Parent and the Company shall promptly
advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental
Entity whose consent, non-objection or approval is required for consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any consent, non-objection
or approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will
be materially delayed or conditioned. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_ to the contrary, materials provided by or on behalf of
Parent to the Company or its counsel or the Company to Parent or its counsel
may be redacted to the extent necessary (a) to remove references concerning
Parents or the Companys valuation analyses with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (b) as necessary to comply with Contracts in effect on the
date hereof or (c) to removal personal, proprietary and other confidential
business information.

 



\- 43 - (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement shall require (or be deemed to require) Parent or any of its
affiliates to agree to or take (nor shall the Company or its Subsidiaries,
without Parents prior written consent, take or agree to take) any action with
respect to the matters set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ that would have
or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on (A) the financial condition or result of operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) the financial
condition or result of operations of Ant Small and Micro Financial Services
Group Co. Ltd and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (but assuming for
purposes of this clause (B) that the business and operations of Ant Small and
Micro Financial Services Group Co. Ltd and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
were of the same size and magnitude as the business and operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (any such arrangements,
conditions or restrictions set forth in clauses (A) or (B), a " _Burdensome
Condition_ "). Furthermore, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require (or be deemed to require)
Parent or any of its affiliates to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose
of, any assets or business of Parent or its affiliates, including those of the
Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing. For the avoidance
of doubt, Parent and its affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not be required (and without the prior consent of Parent, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not), take any action with respect to any order or
any applicable Law or in order to obtain any Approval which is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Prior to Parent being
entitled to invoke a Burdensome Condition, the parties and their respective
Representatives shall meet and confer in good faith in order to (x) exchange
and review their respective views and positions as to such Burdensome
Condition and (y) discuss and present to, and engage with, the applicable
Governmental Entity regarding any potential approaches or workarounds
that would avoid such Burdensome Condition or mitigate its impact so it is no
longer a Burdensome Condition.

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section_
__ _ 5.5_ but subject in all respects to _Section_ __ _ 5.5(c)_, each party
hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any
consents or approvals from any persons (other than Governmental Entities)
that are necessary or advisable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the parties hereto shall
fail to obtain any such third party consent, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and its
Subsidiaries resulting, or which would reasonably be expected to
result, after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with
obtaining any such approval or consent from any persons (other than
Governmental Entities) with respect to any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to, or, without the prior written consent of Parent, shall, pay or
commit to pay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or
other obligation due to such person and (ii) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such person
whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration,
make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation.

 



\- 44 - 5.6. _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) During the period from the Effective Time until the first anniversary
thereof, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide to the
Company Employees who are employees of the Company or a Subsidiary of the
Company at the Effective Time (such Company Employees, " _Continuing
Employees_ "), compensation and benefits that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Closing (excluding equity, equity-based and long-term incentive
compensation and excluding defined benefit pension plan benefits), while such
Continuing Employees remain employed by the Company or a Subsidiary. During
the period from the Effective Time until the first anniversary thereof, Parent
shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide the severance payments
and benefits set forth in the MoneyGram International, Inc. Severance Plan,
as it is in effect as of the signing of this Agreement (the " _Severance Plan_
") for Continuing Employees who are terminated during such period.

 

(b) With respect to each applicable employee welfare and retirement benefit
plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Company (the "
_Parent Plans_ "), if any, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits and vacation entitlement (but
not for accrual of benefits under any defined benefit pension plan or post-
retirement welfare benefit plan), service with the Company or any Subsidiary
(or any predecessor entity thereto) shall be treated as service with Parent to
the same extent recognized by the Company under an comparable Plan; _provided_
,  _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also
shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations with respect to any Parent Plan. Each Parent Plan shall waive pre-
existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods to the same
extent waived under the applicable Plan. The Continuing Employees shall be
given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Plan of the Company or any
Subsidiary during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan during the
applicable plan year.

(c) The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this
Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any current or former employees, officers or directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on
or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies with respect to matters provided for in this _Section_ __ _
5.6_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or the
Surviving Company or any of its affiliates to provide employment, or to
guarantee or any continued compensation, employee benefits or other rights, to
any Company Employee, or to continue any specific Plan. Nothing contained
herein, whether express or implied, shall be construed as an amendment or
modification of any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement.

 



\- 45 - 5.7. _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided
in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on
the date of this Agreement and permitted by applicable Law, all past and
present directors and officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party upon receipt of
an undertaking from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if
it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (in each case
whether asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time) arising out of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in connection
with such Indemnified Person serving as a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (including in connection with an Indemnified Person
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee, trustee or partner of another corporation,
partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other entity and
including acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain or cause the Surviving Company to maintain for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons a directors and officers liability insurance policy
(from the Companys current insurance carrier or an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating, as of the Closing Date, as the Companys
current insurance carrier) that provides coverage for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") with terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to such
Indemnified Persons than the terms and conditions of the existing directors
and officers liability insurance policy of the Company; provided that, at
Parents option, in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Parent or,
with Parents consent, the Company may at or prior to the Effective Time
substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to the DandO
Insurance that provides coverage for period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, with terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, not
less advantageous to such Indemnified Persons than the terms and conditions of
the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent be required
to expend, in the aggregate, an amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for the existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy of the Company (the " _Insurance Amount_
"), and if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by
this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_ for an amount equal to or less than the Insurance
Amount, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as may be available
for the Insurance Amount.

 



\- 46 - (c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent
required, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_.

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_
shall be in addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware law or any other applicable Law or pursuant to any employment
agreement or indemnification agreement in effect on the date hereof.

(e) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall not
permit any amendments to the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries that would
adversely affect any right of a person who was or is a director or officer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,
directors and employees and advancement of expenses under the Companys and
its Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents in effect as of the date hereof.

shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or public
statement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; _provided_
, _however_ , that a party may, without obtaining the prior consent of the
other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statement as may
upon the advice of outside counsel be required by applicable Law or the rules
and regulations of NASDAQ. Without limiting the reach of the preceding
sentence, Parent and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate to
develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate management
available at presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as reasonably requested by the other party. In addition, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall consult with Parent regarding
communications with customers, stockholders, prospective investors and
employees related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



\- 47 - 5.9. _Notice of Certain Matters_. Each party hereto shall give reasonably
prompt written notice to the other party hereto, if to such partys
knowledge, (a) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to
expect that the applicable closing conditions would be incapable of being
satisfied by the End Date or (b) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_  that, (i) nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall be deemed to affect, modify or condition the

any equivalent governing body of any Subsidiary of the Company) prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such
litigation or other Claim and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
current basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall consult

Close); or

 

(ii) (A) by the Company, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(i)_ (Terminable
Breach), as a result of Parents or Merger Subs willful and material breach
of its covenants and agreements set forth herein for which the Company was not
able to obtain or enforce specific performance or an injunction as a remedy
for such willful and material breach or such remedy was not available or (B)

appealable order issued by the President of the United States pursuant to
the Defense Production Act prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which resulted or was caused by Parents or
Merger Subs willful and material breach of its covenants and agreements set
forth herein for which the Company was not able to obtain or enforce specific
performance or an injunction as a remedy for such willful and material breach
or such remedy was not available.

 

(d) Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company or its designee, by

President of the United States pursuant to the Defense Production Act
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ that at the time of such termination, the Companys
failure to perform or observe its covenants and agreements set forth herein
was not the primary cause of the order or other prohibition contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(ii)_; and

(ii) by Parent or the Company, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ (End Date)
if at the time of such termination all of the conditions set forth in Section

failure to perform or observe its covenants and agreements set forth herein
was not the primary cause of the failure of any such condition.

(e) Any Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Regulatory Termination Fee
that becomes payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, _Section_ __ _
7.2(c)_ or _Section 7.2(d)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent or the Company, as
applicable. The parties agree and understand that (i) in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion and
(ii) in no event shall Parent be required to pay both the Parent Termination
Fee and the Parent Regulatory Fee or pay either the Parent Termination Fee or

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties agree that
the Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Regulatory
Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty but are liquidated damages, in
a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in
the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. In the event that a party is required
to commence litigation as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ to seek all or a
portion of the amounts payable to such party under this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_,
and such party prevails in the litigation, it shall be entitled to receive, in
addition to all amounts that it is otherwise entitled to receive under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_, all reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees)
which it has incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder, together with
interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime rate set forth in the
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date the payment was actually received (collectively, the "
_Expense and Interest Payments_ ").

breaches this Agreement or fails to perform any of its covenants, obligations
or agreements hereunder (whether such breach or failure is willful and
material, unintentional or otherwise), the sole and exclusive remedies
(whether such remedies are sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the non-breaching party or parties against the Company Related
Parties,

for any losses, damages, costs, expenses, obligations or liabilities arising
out of or related to this Agreement (or any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement contained in this Agreement), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any failure of such
transactions to be consummated), the Debt Commitment Letter and
the financings contemplated therein (or any failure of such financings to be
consummated) shall be:

equitable relief in accordance with the terms and subject to the limitations
of _Section_ __ _ 8.12_; and

circumstances under which such fee is payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.2(c)_ (and, if applicable, any Expense and Interest Payments) or the Parent
Regulatory Termination Fee in circumstances where it is payable pursuant to
_Section 7.2(d)_ (and if applicable, any Expense and Interest Payments) and
(B) in any circumstance in which the Parent Termination Fee or Parent
Regulatory Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_
or _Section 7.2(d)_ , seek money damages from Parent in the event of
Guarantors, Parents or Merger Subs willful and material breach of any of
their representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements
contained in this Agreement or fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
circumstances described in this clause (B), in no event shall Parent or Merger
Sub have any monetary liability or obligations in excess of an amount equal
to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (and, if applicable, any Expense
and Interest Payments); and

 

(iii) Parents right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 7.1_ and (A) receive the Company Termination Fee in the circumstances
under which such fee is payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ (and, if
applicable, any Expense and Interest Payments) and (B) in any circumstance
under which the Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to Section 7.2(b),
seek money damages from the Company in the event of the Companys willful and
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations or agreements contained in this Agreement or fraud; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the circumstances described in clause (B) above, in no
event shall the Company have any monetary liability or obligations in excess
of an amount equal to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (and, if
applicable, any Expense and Interest Payments).

(h) While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.12_ and the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, under no
circumstances shall the Company or Parent be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance that results in the Effective Time
occurring and the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as
applicable.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company
(and the Company shall cause the Company Related Parties to not) seek,
directly or indirectly, to recover against any Lender Related Parties, or
compel payment by any Lender Related Parties of, any damages or other payments
whatsoever or bring against any Lender

 



\- 58 -  Related Parties any actions or other Claims (whether such remedies are
sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise), in each case
in this clause arising out of or related to this Agreement (or any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained
herein), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any failure of
such transactions to be consummated), the Debt Commitment Letter and the
financings contemplated therein (or any failure of such financings to be
consummated), or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be
made in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter; provided
that the foregoing shall not restrict Claims that the Company may assert: (x)
against each of Parent and Merger Sub under, and solely pursuant to the terms
and limitations of, this Agreement, (y) against Guarantor under, and solely
pursuant to the terms and limitations of, the Guaranty, set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.16_ and subject to the other terms and limitations of this
Agreement and (z) against the Issuer Bank under the Payment Guarantee.

to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise or (ii)
