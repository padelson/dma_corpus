 B. As an inducement and condition to the entrance of Purchaser into this Agreement, Company is granting to Purchaser an option pursuant to a stock option agreement in the form set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the " _Option Agreement_ ").

 

 C. The parties intend the Merger to be treated as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), and intend for this Agreement to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the Code.

 

 D. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

 1.1 _The Merger_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the "PBCL"), at the Effective Time, Company shall merge with and into Purchaser. Purchaser shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall continue its existence as a corporation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease.

 

 (b) Subject to the consent of Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, Purchaser may at any time change the method of effecting the combination (including by providing for the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser into Company) if and to the extent requested by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration to be received by the stockholders of the Company, (ii) adversely affect the tax consequences of the Merger to stockholders of Company or the Tax treatment of either party pursuant to this

  Agreement or (iii) impede or materially delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on or before the Closing Date, the parties shall execute, and Purchaser shall cause to be filed with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, articles of merger as provided in Sections 1926 and 1927 of the PBCL (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") and Purchaser will cause a certificate of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 252 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger have been filed, or such other time as may be specified therein. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger.

 

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL and the PBCL.

 

 1.4 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of Purchaser (" _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $5.00, of the Surviving Company.

 

 (b) All shares of common stock, par value $4.00 per share, of Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") that are owned by Company or Purchaser (other than shares of Company Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties (any such shares, " _Trust Account Common Shares_ ") and other than shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Company or Purchaser in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares, " _DPC Common Shares_ ")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Purchaser or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 (c) Subject to Section 1.4(e), each share of the Company Common Stock, including Trust Account Common Shares and DPC Common Shares, but excluding all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by Company or Purchaser, shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article II, into the right to receive 0.0392 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a share of Purchaser Common Stock of Purchaser (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

 (d) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and/or

  cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this
Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any dividends to which holders of
Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with Section 2.3(c).

 

 (e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.

 

 1.5 _Stock Options_.

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, all outstanding and unexercised employee and director options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") will vest and then cease to represent an option to purchase Company Common Stock and will be converted automatically into options to purchase Purchaser Common Stock, and Purchaser will assume each Company Stock Option subject to its terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time:

 

 (i) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Company Stock Option will equal the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable under the Company Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share; and

 

 (ii) the per share exercise price for each Company Stock Option will equal the quotient of (i) the per share exercise price of the Company Stock Option in effect immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent.

 

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the exercise price and the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Stock Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with any applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and (ii) in the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any rights resulting from the transactions contemplated under this Agreement pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the award agreements thereunder). As used in this Agreement, the term " _Company Stock Plans_ " means the plans set forth in Section 1.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  1.6 _Company Restricted Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any of the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and become free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time and, at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each such Company Restricted Share in accordance with Section 1.4.

 

 1.7 _Company Deferred Shares_. Each outstanding deferred share of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Deferred Share_ ") under the Company Stock Plans shall vest in full upon the Effective Time and, at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each such Company Deferred Share in accordance with Section 1.4.

 

 1.8 _Other Stock-Based Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock, granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company Deferred Shares) (each, a " _Company Stock Award_ ") shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a right or award with respect to Purchaser Common Stock, and Purchaser will assume each Company Stock Award subject to its terms; _provided, however,_ that after the Effective Time the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Award will equal the product of (a) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Award immediately before the Effective Time and (b) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole share. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Company Stock Award shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any rights resulting from the transactions contemplated under this Agreement pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the award agreements thereunder).

 

 1.9 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Company_. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. The by-laws of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and the terms of such by-laws.

 

 1.10 _Directors and Officers_. Subject to applicable law, the directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Closing Date, together with such officers of Company as the Board of Directors of Purchaser may determine before the Effective Time, shall be the officers of the Surviving Company and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

  1.11 _Company Preferred Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of each series of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into a share of Purchaser Preferred Stock having rights, privileges, powers and preferences substantially identical to those of the relevant series of Company Preferred Stock.

 

 1.12 _Effect on Purchaser Stock; Required Purchaser Action_. Each share of Purchaser Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain outstanding. Before the Effective Time, Purchaser will take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options in accordance with Section 1.5 and for delivery under Company Stock Awards in accordance with Section 1.8. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Purchaser will file one or more appropriate registration statements (on Form S-3 or Form S-8 or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock underlying the Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 1.5 and subject to the Company Stock Awards pursuant to Section 1.8.

 

ARTICLE II

 

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

 2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall appoint a bank or trust company Subsidiary of Purchaser or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company, or Purchasers transfer agent, pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder.

 

 2.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall (i) authorize the Exchange Agent to issue an aggregate number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited with, the Exchange Agent, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

 2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates)) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

  (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

 

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Purchaser Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Purchaser Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.

 

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of Company, the shares of Purchaser Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Purchaser that the tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Purchaser) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Purchaser, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Purchaser, as the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Purchaser, as the case may be.

  (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

 

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Purchaser Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Purchaser. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Purchaser shall pay to each former stockholder of Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth, of the closing sale prices of Purchaser Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

 

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be paid to Purchaser. In such event, any former stockholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Purchaser with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Purchaser Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Purchaser, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Purchaser may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Each of Purchaser and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Company and Purchaser shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to their stockholders and shareholders, respectively. Purchaser shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Company shall furnish all information concerning Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

 (b) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all

  applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or
Governmental Entities. In furtherance (but not in limitation) of the
foregoing, Purchaser shall file any required applications, notices or other
filings with the Federal Reserve and under the HSR Act within 20 days of the
date hereof. Company and Purchaser shall have the right to review in advance,
and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all
the information relating to Company or Purchaser, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 (c) Each of Purchaser and Company shall, upon request, furnish to the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Purchaser, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 (d) Purchaser agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Company, at or prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other instruments required for the due assumption of Companys outstanding debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

 

 (e) Each of Purchaser and Company shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Purchaser Requisite Regulatory Approval or Company Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

 

 6.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, each of Company and Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, such party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the

  requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking or
insurance laws (other than reports or documents that such party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request. Neither Company nor Purchaser, nor any of their
Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

 (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into between the parties as of October 3, 2008 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

 (c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in this Agreement.

 

 6.3 _Stockholder Approval_. (a) The Board of Directors of Company will submit to its stockholders the plan of merger contained in this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved or adopted by its stockholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, Company will take, in accordance with applicable law and the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of its stockholders, as promptly as practicable, to consider and vote upon approval of the plan of merger as well as any other such matters. The Board of Directors of Company will use all reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders a vote approving and adopting the plan of merger contained in this Agreement. However, if the Board of Directors of Company, after consultation with (and based on the advice of) counsel, determines in good faith that, because of special circumstances (it being agreed that such special circumstances will include, for purposes of this Agreement, the receipt by Company of an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal), it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to Companys stockholders, the Board of Directors of Company may submit this Agreement to its stockholders without recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Company may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ that Company may not take any actions under this sentence until after giving Purchaser at least two business days to respond to any such Acquisition Proposal or other circumstances giving rise to such particular proposed action (and after giving Purchaser notice of the latest material terms, conditions and identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal or describe in reasonable detail such other circumstances) and then taking into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Purchaser (it being agreed that Section 2 of the Confidentiality Agreement will not preclude such a response or proposal).

 

 (b) The Board of Directors of Purchaser will submit to its shareholders the proposed issuance of Purchaser Common Stock in connection with the Merger. In furtherance of

  that obligation, Purchaser will take, in accordance with applicable law and
the Purchaser Certificate and Purchaser Bylaws, all action necessary to
convene a meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as practicable, to consider
and vote upon approval of the issuance proposal. The Board of Directors of
Purchaser will use all reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders
a vote approving the issuance of Purchaser Common Stock. However, if the Board
of Directors of Purchaser, after consultation with (and based on the advice
of) counsel, determines in good faith that, because of special circumstances,
it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable law to continue to recommend the issuance proposal, then in
submitting the issuance proposal to Purchasers shareholders, the Board of
Directors of Purchaser may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors of Purchaser may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to the shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an
appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law.

 

 (c) If either the Company or Purchaser shall have failed to obtain the requisite vote of its shareholders for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a duly held meeting of its shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, then, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration) and to resubmit the transaction to such partys shareholders for approval.

 

 6.4 _NYSE Listing_. Purchaser shall cause the shares of capital stock of Purchaser to be issued in exchange for capital stock of Company that is currently listed on the NYSE upon consummation of the Merger to have been authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

 6.5 _Employee Matters_. (a) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the benefit of employees (as a group) who are actively employed by Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities which, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and compensation opportunities that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries), as applicable; _provided_ that (i) in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries; and (ii) until such time as Purchaser shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the benefit plans and compensation opportunities that are made available to similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries), a Covered Employees continued participation in employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities of Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that participation in the Purchaser plans may commence at different times with respect to each Purchaser plan).

  (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company or its Subsidiaries), Purchaser shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Covered Employee with Company or its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and, except under any defined benefit pension plan, benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that such recognition of service (A) shall not operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service and (B) shall not apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement under which similarly-situated employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service; and (ii) with respect to any health, dental, vision plan or other welfare of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, use its reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Purchaser or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) recognize any health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, subject to the requirements of applicable law, Purchaser shall honor all obligations to current and former employees of Company and its Subsidiaries under the Company Benefit Plans, including all employment or severance agreements entered into by Company or its Subsidiaries or adopted by the Board of Directors of Company. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts such that, from and after the Effective Time, all payments, awards, distributions and benefits under the Company Benefit Plans may be made without any requirement of consent or prior approval from or by any applicable bank regulatory authority. In the event such consent or approval is required, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such consent/approval as promptly as possible.

 

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed to limit the right of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this Section 6.5 be construed to require the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time following the Closing Date.

 

 (e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Benefit Plans_ " means each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), whether or not subject to ERISA, and each employment,

  consulting, bonus, incentive or deferred compensation, vacation, stock option
or other equity-based, severance, termination, retention, change of control,
profit-sharing, fringe benefit or other similar plan, program, agreement or
commitment, whether written or unwritten, for the benefit of any employee,
former employee, director or former director of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries entered into, maintained or contributed to by Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated
to contribute, or with respect to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
any liability, direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise (including any
liability arising out of an indemnification, guarantee, hold harmless or
similar agreement) or otherwise providing benefits to any current, former or
future employee, officer or director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
to any beneficiary or dependant thereof.

 

 (f) Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company has taken the actions set forth in Section 6.5(f) of the Disclosure Schedule.

 

 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (and Purchaser shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director, officer and employee of Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Option Agreement.

 

 (b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six years following the Effective Time, Purchaser will provide directors and officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) (providing only for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for Company) with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided by Company. At the option of the Company, prior to the Effective Time and in lieu of the foregoing, Company may purchase a tail policy for directors and officers liability insurance on the terms described in the prior sentence and fully pay for such policy prior to the Closing.

 

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.6(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, will promptly notify Purchaser; _provided_ that failure so to notify will not affect the obligations of Purchaser under Section 6.6(a) unless and to the extent that Purchaser is actually and materially prejudiced as a consequence.

  (d) If Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, Purchaser will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser will assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.

 

 6.7 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b_ ). Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser and Company shall each take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in the applicable SEC No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999.

 

 6.8 _No Solicitation_.

 

 (a) Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, advisors and affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that, in the event Company receives an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal and the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith (and based on the advice of counsel) that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to Company than the Confidentiality Agreement. Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Purchaser with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Company will promptly (and in any event within two business days) advise Purchaser following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Purchaser apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis.

 

 (b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company or its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  As used in this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means a tender or exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more than 15% of the voting power in, or more than 15% of the fair market value of the business, assets or deposits of, Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any sale of whole loans and securitizations in the ordinary course and any _bona fide_ internal reorganization.

 

 As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable law; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "more than 15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a majority".

 (c) by either Company or Purchaser, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement;

 

 (d) by either Company or Purchaser ( _provided_ that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of Company, in the case of a termination by Purchaser, or Purchaser, in the case of a termination by Company, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, and which is not cured within 60 days following written notice to the party committing such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

 

 (e) by Purchaser, if the Board of Directors of Company submits this Agreement to its stockholders without a recommendation for approval, the Board of Directors of Company otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its recommendation referred to in Section 6.3, or the Board of Directors of Company recommends to its stockholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger; or

If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that any provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, void or unenforceable, it is the express intention of the parties that such provision, covenant or restriction be enforced to the maximum extent permitted.

 

 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that each party need not sign the same counterpart.

 9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and performed entirely within such state, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles; _provided_ that the PBCL and the DGCL, including the provisions thereof governing the fiduciary duties of directors of a Pennsylvania corporation and a Delaware corporation, respectively, shall govern as applicable. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal or state court located in the State of New York. Each of the parties hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction derived from present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  9.10 _Specific Performance_.

 9.11 _Disclosure Schedule_. Before entry into this Agreement, Company delivered to Purchaser a schedule (a " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") that sets forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Article III, or to one or more covenants contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ " means information set forth by Company in the applicable paragraph of its Disclosure Schedule, or any other paragraph of its Disclosure Schedule (so long as it is reasonably clear from the context that the disclosure in such other paragraph of its Disclosure Schedule is also applicable to the section of this Agreement in question).
