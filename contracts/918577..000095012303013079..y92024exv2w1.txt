AGREEMENT   This Asset Purchase Agreement (together with all exhibits and
schedules hereto and as the same may be amended, supplemented or otherwise

assets of the Business, and Sellers desire to sell substantially all of the
assets of the Business to Buyer, all in the manner and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with Sections
105, 363, 365 and the other applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code (the
"Contemplated Transactions").   WHEREAS, unless otherwise indicated in this
Agreement, capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings
set forth for such terms in Article IX hereto.   NOW, THEREFORE, for good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   PURCHASE AND
SALE OF BUSINESS   Section 1.1. Acquired Assets. On the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and subject to the approval of
the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to Sections 105, 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code, at the Closing, Sellers shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and
deliver, or cause to be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered,
to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and accept from Sellers, all of Sellers\'
rights, title and interests (but, except as set forth in Section 1.3 below,
none of the Liabilities) in and to each and all of the Acquired Assets.
"Acquired Assets" shall mean the assets, properties, rights, and claims of
Sellers of every nature used in, held for use or related to the Business
(other than the Excluded Assets), real or personal, now existing or hereafter
acquired, whether or not reflected on the books or financial statements of
the Sellers, wherever located, whether tangible or intangible, as the same
shall exist at the Closing. The sale and purchase of the Acquired Assets
shall be free and clear of all Encumbrances, in each case other than
Permitted Encumbrances and Encumbrances included in the Assumed Liabilities.
The Acquired Assets shall include, but not be limited to, all of Sellers\'
rights, title and interests in and to the assets, properties, rights and
claims described in clauses (a) through (r) below (except as expressly
excluded pursuant to Section 1.2 of this Agreement):     (a) All (i)
equipment, machinery, tooling, dies, furniture, fixtures and improvements and
other tangible personal property owned by Sellers and used or held for use in
the Business (the "Owned Machinery and Equipment"), (ii) equipment,
machinery, tooling, dies, furniture, fixtures and improvements and other
tangible personal property used or held for use in the Business which are
leased by Sellers pursuant to an Assumed Contract (the "Leased Machinery
and Equipment," and together with the Owned Machinery and Equipment, the
"Machinery and Equipment"), and (iii) rights of Sellers to the warranties,
express or implied, and licenses received from manufacturers, sellers and
lessors of the Machinery and Equipment.   (b) All inventories of raw
materials, slabs, goods, work in process, finished products and stock in
trade used or held for use in the Business (the "Inventory").   (c) All
supplies, items, spare parts, replacement and component parts and office and
other materials and tangible items used, held for use or necessary to operate
and maintain the Machinery and Equipment or to process raw materials and work
in process into finished products in the conduct of the Business (the
"Supplies").   (d) All owned real property described on SCHEDULE
1.1(d)(1), together with any and all buildings, fixtures, structures and
improvements located thereon and all rights, privileges, easements, licenses,
hereditaments and other appurtenances relating thereto (the "Owned Real
Property") and all leased real property described on SCHEDULE 1.1(d)(2),
together with any buildings, fixtures, structures and improvements located
thereon and all rights, privileges, easements, licenses, hereditaments and
other appurtenances relating thereto (collectively, the "Leased Real
Property," and together with the Owned Real Property, the "Real
Property").   (e) Those leases (including leases and subleases of
Leased Real Property and of Machinery and Equipment) and other Contracts
(together with all of Sellers\' deposits thereunder) entered into by any
Seller that constitute an "executory contract" or "unexpired lease" as such
terms are used in Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, an
"Executory Contract") as of the Closing Date and are set forth on SCHEDULE
1.1(e), the Ordinary Course Contracts and any other Contract related to the
Business that Buyer has requested in writing be deemed to be an Assumed
Contract (collectively, the "Assumed Contracts"). At any time prior to the
date scheduled by the Bankruptcy Court for the Sale Hearing, Buyer in its
sole discretion by written notice to Sellers may exclude any Contract (other
than an Ordinary Course Contract) relating to the Business to which any
Seller is a party and that constitutes an Executory Contract from SCHEDULE
1.1(e). Any Executory Contract so excluded pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall no longer be deemed an "Assumed Contract" under this Agreement. Upon
Buyer\'s reasonable request, Sellers shall provide additional detailed
information as to the obligations under any Executory Contract sufficient for
Buyer to make an informed assessment whether to include or exclude such
Executory Contract from the Assumed Contracts.   (f) All Intangible Property
and all rights thereunder or in respect thereof, including rights to sue and
collect any remedies against past, present and future infringements or
misappropriations thereof, and rights of priority and protection of interests
therein under the laws of any jurisdiction worldwide and all tangible
embodiments thereof used or held for use in the operation of the
Business.   (g) All Accounts Receivable.   (h) All Permits and all pending
applications therefor, including those Permits set forth on SCHEDULE
1.1(h).   2     (i) Except as set forth in Section 1.2(e), all
prepaid expenses and deposits made in connection with the Business (other
than any letters of credit issued under the DIP Facility that are not
cash collateralized), including those set forth on SCHEDULE 1.1(i).   (j)
All books, records, files, or papers, whether in hard copy or electronic
format, used or held for use in the Business or in respect of the Acquired
Assets, including invoices, product specifications, advertising materials,

to an Assumed Contract and, in either case, used or held for use in the
Business, including, without limitation, the Software listed on SCHEDULE

Joint Ventures, as set forth on SCHEDULE 1.1(m) (the "Joint Venture
Interests") and (ii) to the extent in the possession of Sellers,

and such other files, books and records of Sellers relating to the Joint
Ventures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, so long as Sellers have acted in accordance with the standards set
forth in Section 5.3, if Sellers are unable to convey at the Closing
Sellers\' joint venture interest (the "Double Eagle JV Interest") in Double
Eagle Steel Coating Company ("Double Eagle") because the counterparty to such
joint venture validly exercises its right of first refusal pursuant to the
joint venture agreement relating to Double Eagle (the "Double Eagle JV
Agreement"), then (i) the Double Eagle JV Interest shall be deemed
an Excluded Asset and (ii) (A) if such sale is consummated prior to the
Closing, the proceeds from such sale (the "JV Interest Proceeds") shall be
held in escrow (the "JV Interest Proceeds Escrow")for the benefit of Buyer in
a manner reasonably satisfactory to Buyer to ensure that Buyer receives 100%
of the JV Interest Proceeds at the Closing or (B) if such sale is consummated
after the Closing, the JV Interest Proceeds shall be delivered directly to
Buyer. In addition, the parties hereto agree and acknowledge that (i) the JV
Interest Proceeds shall be in cash and (ii) if this agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.1, the JV Interest Proceeds, if any, shall be released
from the JV Interest Proceeds Escrow and delivered to Sellers.   (n) All
goodwill associated with the Business or the Acquired Assets.   (o) Any

the day prior to the Closing Date, whether or not deposited or cleared prior
to the close of business on the Closing Date), commercial paper, marketable
securities, certificates of deposit and other bank deposits, treasury bills
and other cash equivalents (other than amounts in the Blocked Account or
amounts in the possession of the Agent, any lender or participant, in each
case, which have been credited to the loan account(s) of Sellers maintained
by the Agent in accordance with the terms of the DIP Facility).   Section
1.2. Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Acquired Assets shall not include any of Sellers\'
rights, title or interests in the following (collectively, the "Excluded

foregoing.   (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, this Section 5.1 shall not prevent Sellers from rejecting

Affiliates shall be liable for any claims arising from the rejection of such
Contracts by Sellers.   Section 5.2. Access to Records and Properties.  
(a) From the Execution Date until the Closing Date, Sellers (i) shall give
Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours

surface water or groundwater, and (ii) shall furnish to Buyer and
its Representatives such financial, operating and property related data and
other information as such persons reasonably request. It is acknowledged
and understood that no investigation by Buyer or other information received
by Buyer shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation,
warranty or other agreement given or made by Sellers under this
Agreement.   (b) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall give
Sellers and Sellers\' Representative reasonable access during normal business
hours to the books and records pertaining to the Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities and, to the extent that Sellers retain any Liabilities with

the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States the voluntary
notification under the Exon-Florio Amendment in connection with the

Authority or third party in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and (y)
timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such material consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations, and (iv) use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
action and do, or cause to be done,   18   all other things reasonably
necessary or appropriate with respect to any Governmental Authority or third
parties to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, as soon as practicable.
In connection with the foregoing, Sellers will promptly provide to Buyer, and
Buyer will promptly provide to Sellers, copies of all correspondence, filings
or communications (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to all filings and submissions required under this Agreement.   (b)
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and
Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable consistent with applicable Law to cause the conditions
precedent to the Closing to be satisfied and to cause the Closing to occur on
or prior to the Termination Date, including, without limitation, to obtain
the consent, approval, release, estoppel, certificate, opinion and
other instrument of any third party or Governmental Authority, including,
without limitation, the Third Party Consent Requirements necessary to deliver
title to any Acquired Asset, free and clear of all Encumbrances except for
the Permitted Encumbrances and to otherwise consummate the Contemplated
Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided,
however, Sellers shall not make any payments in connection with obtaining any
third party consents or approvals without the prior written consent of Buyer;
provided, further, Buyer shall not be required to waive any of the conditions
to this Agreement set forth in Article VI. Promptly after the Execution Date,
the parties hereto shall work together in good faith to finalize the
Schedules referred to in this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedules");
provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree and
acknowledge that the Disclosure Schedules shall be dated and effective as of
the Execution Date regardless of the date they are dated or attached to this
Agreement and shall include only matters existing or of which Sellers have
Knowledge on and as of the Execution Date.   (c) Sellers shall use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain entry of the Sale Order, in accordance with
Section 5.6, subject to their obligations under the Bankruptcy Code.   (d)
Each Seller agrees that it will promptly take such actions as are reasonably
intended to obtain the entry by the Bankruptcy Court of the Sale Order, in
accordance with Section 5.6, including, without limitation, demonstrating
that (i) Buyer is a "good faith" purchaser under Section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code and (ii) Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code should
apply to the sale of the Acquired Assets. In the event that stay of the Sale
Order is sought or any of such orders are appealed, each Seller and Buyer
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to oppose such request for a
stay or defend any such appeal, as applicable. Buyer and Sellers shall
provide one another with all information reasonably requested by the other in
connection with such actions.   (e) Sellers shall provide Buyer with copies
of all material motions and applications prepared by Sellers (including forms
of the Sale Order and other orders and notices to interested parties)
relating to Buyer, this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions prior to
the filing thereof in the Bankruptcy Court. Sellers shall give prompt notice
to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt notice to Sellers, of (i) any notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
which is or may be required in connection with the Contemplated Transactions
is not likely to be obtained prior to Closing, and (ii) any written objection
or proceeding that challenges the Contemplated Transactions or the entry of
the Sale Order. Sellers shall give prompt notice to Buyer of (i) any notice
of any alleged violation of Law applicable to any Seller, including any
notice from any Governmental Authority; (ii) the commencement of any
investigation, inquiry or review by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Business or that any such investigation, inquiry or review, to the
Knowledge of any Seller, is contemplated; (iii) the infringement or
unauthorized use by any Person of any material Intangible Property (of which
any Seller has Knowledge); (iv) the execution of any Material Contract  
19   (and Sellers shall deliver or make available a copy thereof to Buyer);
and (v) any changes in the capital spending plans of Parent and the other
Sellers relating to the Business or the Acquired Assets that were made
available to Buyer on or prior to the Execution Date. Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt Notice to Buyer of the
execution of any Ordinary Course Contract and, upon the request of Buyer. to
make available to Buyer copies of any such Ordinary Course Contracts.  
Section 5.4. Transfers Not Effected as of Closing. To the extent that the
Contemplated Transactions are consummated but the parties hereto have
been unable to obtain any governmental or any third party consents or
approvals required under applicable Law for the transfer of any Acquired
Asset, Sellers shall continue to be bound by the terms of such applicable
Acquired Asset or remain the owner of such Acquired Asset, and Buyer shall
pay, perform and discharge fully all of the obligations of Sellers arising in
connection with such Acquired Asset from and after the Closing to the extent
that the corresponding benefit is received. In such event (i) Sellers shall,
without consideration therefor, pay, assign, and remit to Buyer promptly all
monies, rights and other consideration received in respect of such
performance, (ii) Sellers shall exercise or exploit their rights in respect
of such Acquired Assets only as reasonably directed by Buyer and at Buyer\'s
expense and (iii) subject to and in accordance with Section 5.3, for so long
as Sellers continue to exist as legal entities following the Closing Date,
the parties hereto shall continue to use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all such unobtained consents or approvals required to be
obtained by it at the earliest practicable date. If and when any such
consents or approvals shall be obtained, Sellers shall promptly assign their
rights and obligations thereunder to Buyer without payment of consideration
and Buyer shall, without the payment of any consideration therefor, assume
such rights and obligations. The parties shall execute such good and
sufficient instruments as may be necessary to evidence such assignment and
assumption.   Section 5.5. Public Announcements. From the Execution Date
until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, Buyer
and Sellers will consult with each other before issuing, and provide each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release, any
court filing or pleading filed with the Bankruptcy Court relating to this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, or other public statements with
respect to the Contemplated Transactions, and neither Buyer nor any Seller
shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement without
the prior approval of the other party (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), in each case except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange. Buyer and each Seller shall
cause its Affiliates, employees, officers and directors to comply with this
Section 5.5.   Section 5.6. Submission for Court Approval. As promptly as
practicable after the Execution Date, Sellers shall file with the Bankruptcy
Court this Agreement and such notices as may be appropriate in connection
therewith. Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers in obtaining Bankruptcy Court
approval of the Bidding Procedures, including providing evidence, if
requested, of Buyer\'s ability to perform the obligations of Sellers under
the Assumed Contracts.   Section 5.7. Bidding Procedures. Sellers
acknowledge that this Agreement is the culmination of an extensive process
undertaken by Sellers to identify and negotiate a transaction with a bidder
who was prepared to pay the highest or otherwise best purchase price for the
Acquired Assets while assuming or otherwise satisfying certain liabilities in
order to maximize value for Sellers\' constituents. Set forth on Exhibit D
attached to this Agreement are bidding procedures (the "Bidding Procedures")
substantially in the form of those to be employed with respect to this
Agreement concerning the sale of the Acquired Assets to Buyer (the "Sale").
The Sale is subject to competitive bidding as set forth in this Agreement and
approval by the Bankruptcy Court at a hearing under Sections 363 and 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code (the "Sale Hearing"). The overbid provisions and related
bid protections set forth on Exhibit D are   20   designed to compensate
Buyer for its efforts and agreements to date and to facilitate a full and
fair process designed to maximize the value of the Acquired Assets for the
benefit of Sellers\' stakeholders.   Section 5.8. Notice of Breach;
Disclosure. Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer and the Agent, and Buyer
shall promptly notify Sellers and the Agent, of (a) any event, condition or
circumstance of which any Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, becomes aware
after the Execution Date and prior to the Closing Date that would constitute
a violation or breach of this Agreement (or a breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement) or, if the same were to continue to
exist as of the Closing Date, would constitute the non-satisfaction of any of
the conditions set forth in Article VI, as the case may be or (b) any event,
occurrence, transaction, or other item of which Buyer or any Seller, as the
case may be, becomes aware which would have been required to have been
disclosed on any schedule attached hereto had such event, occurrence,
transaction or item existed as of the Execution Date. It is acknowledged and
understood no notice given pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall have any effect
on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of the conditions
contained herein.   Section 5.9. Payment Under Assumed Contracts and
Determination of Cure Costs. As promptly as practicable following the
Execution Date, Buyer and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate and determine an estimate of the amounts required to cure all
defaults under each Assumed Contract so as to permit the assumption and
assignment of each such Assumed Contract pursuant to Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code (as ultimately determined by the Bankruptcy Court, the "Cure
Costs"). In connection with the assignment and assumption of the Assumed
Contracts, Buyer shall pay all Cure Costs.   Section 5.10. Further
Assurances. In addition to the provisions of this Agreement, from time to
time after the Closing Date, Sellers shall execute and deliver such other
instruments of conveyance, transfer or assumption, as the case may be, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and take such other
action as may be reasonably requested to vest in Buyer all of the Sellers\'
right, title and interest in and to the Acquired Assets.   Section 5.11.
Employee Matters. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall make employment offers to
certain employees of the Business on terms and conditions established by
Buyer. Within ten (10) days of the date hereof, Sellers shall provide a list
of all employees of the Business. Any employees who accept Buyer\'s offer are
hereinafter referred to as "Transferred Employees." Buyer shall have no
obligations with respect to employees of Sellers who do not accept Buyer\'s
offer. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall permit and allow reasonable
access by Buyer to discuss and make offers of post-Closing employment with
any of Sellers\' employees. On or before the Closing Date, Sellers
shall provide a list to Buyer of the names of all employees who have
experienced an "employment loss" under the WARN Act.   Section 5.12.
Financial Reports. Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a copy of the monthly and
other financial reporting packages that are required or proposed to be
required to be sent to the lenders under the debtor-in-possession credit
agreements entered into by Sellers in connection with the Bankruptcy Cases
for each full month following the Execution Date (including the month
in which this Agreement is signed) until Closing, which copies shall be
delivered to Buyer within the time period required for delivery of such
monthly financial reports to such lenders.   Section 5.13. Improper Receipt
of Payments. From and after the Closing Date, (i) Sellers shall promptly
forward to Buyer any and all payments received by Sellers from customers or
any other Persons, which constitute part of the Acquired Assets and (ii)
Buyer shall promptly forward to Sellers any and all payments received by
Buyer from customers or any other Persons, which constitute part of the
Excluded Assets.   21    Section 5.14. Administrative Claims. All amounts
to be paid to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute an allowed
administrative expense claim with priority over any and all administrative
expenses of the kind specified in Sections 503 and 507 of the Bankruptcy Code
other than administrative priority claims of the Agent under the DIP Facility
and the Carve-Out Expenses (as defined in the DIP Facility).   Section
5.15. Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, value-added,
gain, excise or other similar Taxes arising in connection with the transfer
of the Acquired Assets, and all registration, recording, filing and similar
fees (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), that may be imposed by reason of the
sale, transfer, assignment or delivery of the Acquired Assets shall be
paid 50% by Sellers and 50% by Buyer. The Transfer Taxes shall be calculated
assuming that no exemption from payment thereof is available, unless
otherwise indicated in the Bankruptcy Court\'s approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or, at Closing, Sellers or Buyer, as
appropriate, provides an appropriate resale exemption certificate or other
evidence acceptable to Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, of exemption from
payment of such Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate to timely
prepare and file any Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes, including
any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of
any Transfer Taxes. Each party hereto shall furnish or cause to be furnished
to the other, upon the other\'s reasonable request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Acquired Assets
and the Business as may be reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax
Return, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application
or imposition of any Taxes or making of any election related to Taxes, the
preparation for any audit or examination by any Governmental Authority and
the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any
Tax or Tax Return.   Section 5.16. Proration of Taxes and Certain
Charges.   (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, all real property Taxes, personal property Taxes or similar ad
valorem obligations levied with respect to the Acquired Assets that relate to
the tax year that includes the Closing Date shall be prorated between Sellers
and Buyer as of 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date and Sellers on the one hand
and Buyer on the other hand shall each be responsible for their proportionate
share of such Taxes or obligations (which proportionate shares shall be
determined based on the number of days in such tax year prior to the Closing
Date, on the one hand, and the remaining number of days in such tax year, on
the other hand). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (i) if any such
taxes and assessments which are due and payable in the tax year that includes
the Closing Date have been determined but have not been paid before Closing,
Seller shall be charged at Closing an amount equal to that portion of such
taxes and assessments which relates to the period before the Closing Date
(which portion shall be determined in accordance with the proration method
described in the preceding sentence) and Buyer shall pay the taxes and
assessments prior to their becoming delinquent and (ii) if any such taxes and
assessments which are due and payable in, or relate to, the tax year that
includes the Closing Date have not been determined before Closing, Sellers
and Buyer shall mutually agree in good faith to an estimate of the amount of
such taxes and assessments, Sellers shall be charged at Closing an amount
equal to that portion of such taxes and assessments which relates to
the period before the Closing Date (which portion shall be determined in
accordance with the proration method described in the preceding sentence) and
Buyer shall pay the taxes and assessments prior to their becoming delinquent.
To the extent that the actual taxes and assessments described in the
preceding sentence that are payable in, or relate to, the tax year that
includes the Closing Date differ from the amount apportioned at Closing, the
parties shall make all necessary adjustments by appropriate payments between
themselves within thirty (30) days of the issuance of final tax bills. All
real property Taxes, personal property Taxes or similar ad valorem
obligations that are levied with respect to the Acquired Assets and that
relate to tax years beginning on or after the Closing Date shall be the
responsibility of Buyer.   22    (b) Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, all installments of special assessments or other
charges on or with respect to the Acquired Assets which are customarily
prorated in connection with the sale of similar assets including, without
limitation, base rent, common area maintenance, royalties, all municipal,
utility or authority charges for water, sewer, electric or gas charges,
garbage or waste removal, and cost of fuel, shall be apportioned as of the
Closing Date and each party shall pay its proportionate share promptly upon
the receipt of any bill, statement or other charge with respect thereto. If
such charges or rates are assessed either based upon time or for a specified
period, such charges or rates shall be prorated as of 12:01 A.M. on the
Closing Date. If such charges or rates are assessed based upon usage of
utility or similar services, such charges shall be prorated based upon meter
readings taken on the Closing Date.   (c) Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, all amounts due pursuant to the terms of the
Assumed Contracts, for any period in which the Closing Date shall occur shall
be prorated as of 12:01 A.M. on the Closing Date.   Section 5.17. Union

propose collective bargaining agreements with the UAW and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of the progress of any such negotiations.   Section

Procedures Order, Buyer or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries shall
