and



 

(f) In connection with the Fee Sale and the Lease Assignment and Sale, Purchaser

_provided_ , _however_ , it is understood and agreed by the parties that the

further provided that nothing in this Section 2.1(f) shall be construed as

and described in this Agreement and in the CTF Agreement, a Designee must be
either the Purchaser or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser.

_Section 2.3_   _Debt_. _Schedule 2.4_ of the CTF Agreement sets forth
certain Debt as of the date of this Agreement. Marriott shall cause CTF to
take such action, such that at the Closing all outstanding Debt shall have
been repaid, defeased or otherwise released.



_Section 2.4_ _Intercompany Debt_. Marriott shall cause CTF to take such
action such that at the Closing there shall be no Intercompany Debt
outstanding in respect of any Target. Accordingly, all currently outstanding
Intercompany Debt with respect to each Target shall have been repaid,
cancelled, forgiven, contributed to capital or otherwise extinguished (the
method of extinguishing such Intercompany Debt to be selected by CTF), such
that no Target shall remain liable for the payment of any principal, interest,

_Section 2.5_ _Property Improvement Plan Expenditures_. Purchaser agrees,
pursuant to each of the applicable Hotel Management Agreements, to fund a
maximum amount equal to $35,502,000 minus the PIP Expenditures (such amount,
the " _PIP Amount_ ") towards the immediate renovation and property
improvement needs of the Hotels. Marriott shall, provide Purchaser for the
Long Beach, Westchester and Orlando Hotels prior to Closing, and for the
other Hotels subsequent to Closing, with preliminary Property Improvement
Plans for each Hotel, together with estimated pricing thereof, describing all
of the renovation and property improvement needs that Marriott considers
necessary to meet System Standards (as defined in the Hotel Management
Agreements) or otherwise desirable (the " _Preliminary PIPs_ "). Following the
delivery of each of the Preliminary PIPs, Purchaser shall work with Marriott
to refine and revise the Preliminary PIPs, in both scope and pricing, with the
objective of agreeing upon final Property Improvement Plans that will satisfy
all System Standards (as well as any other work mutually agreed upon) for a
budgeted amount not in excess of the PIP Amount. If the parties are able to
agree on such final Property Improvement Plans, they shall be deemed to be the
Renovation Plans for all purposes of the Hotel Management Agreements. In the
event that, within thirty (30) days following the delivery of the last
Preliminary PIP, Purchaser and Marriott are unable to agree on final Property
Improvement Plans for the Hotels in an aggregate amount not exceeding the
PIP Amount, then Marriott shall determine the scope of the final Property
Improvement Plans (which shall be consistent with the Preliminary PIPs and
System Standards) provided that the pricing of such scope (as determined by
Marriott) shall not be in excess of the PIP Amount. If the costs of the
agreed final Property Improvement Plans are less than the PIP Amount, the PIP
Amount will be reduced accordingly. In no event shall Purchaser be required to
fund amounts in excess of the PIP Amount for the agreed final Property
Improvement Plans. Upon completion of the Final PIP (as that term is defined
in, and in accordance with, the terms  



 

-16-  of the applicable Hotel Management Agreement), such Hotel shall be deemed to
comply with the System Standards (as defined in the Hotel Management
Agreements) in effect as of the date of completion.



_ARTICLE 3_.  _PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AND CLOSING_



_Section 3.1_ _Purchase Price_. In consideration for the Transaction, the
Purchaser shall pay into escrow at the Closing an aggregate purchase price of
U.S. $419,470,000 (the " _Unadjusted Purchase_ _Price_ "), as shall be
adjusted as provided in this Article 3, Section 7.3 and Section 9.2 (the "
_Adjusted Purchase Price_ ").



_Section 3.2_ _Deposit_. Upon execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
deposit into escrow $20,000,000 (the " _Deposit_ ") with the Title Company.
The Deposit will be non-refundable, other than for termination based on a
failure of a material condition to Purchasers obligation to consummate the
Transaction. If the Transaction is consummated, the Deposit, and
interest earned thereon, will be applied against the Purchase Price;
provided, however, if the Buy-Sell Procedures for the Techworld Hotel are
invoked in accordance with _Schedule 9.2(d)_ of this Agreement, the Deposit
and all interest earned thereon shall be retained by the Title Company to
secure Purchasers obligations pursuant to _Schedule 9.2(d)_.



_Section 3.3_ _Estimated Working Capital, Capital Expenditure and PIP
Expenditure Adjustments_.



(a) Section 3.2 of the CTF Agreement contemplates, and provides a procedure
for, CTF and Marriott to determine certain items defined and described therein
as the Estimated Total Working Capital, the Estimated North American Capex and
the Estimated PIP Expenditures. Marriott and Purchaser shall recalculate the
Estimated Total Working Capital, utilizing the definition of Working Capital
set forth in this Agreement for all purposes and calculations contemplated in
this Section 3.3(a). At Closing, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be:
(i) increased (or decreased) by the amount by which the Estimated Total
Working Capital applicable to the Hotels is more (or less) than $0; (ii)
increased (or decreased) by the amount by which the Estimated North American
Capex applicable to the Hotels is more (or less) than the Target North
American Capex Amount as set forth on _Schedule 3.3(a)_ ; and (iii) increased
by the amount of the Estimated PIP Expenditures.



(b) At Closing Purchaser shall provide to Marriott for each Hotel an amount
equal to the Adjusted Working Capital for such Hotel. _Adjusted Working
Capital_ shall mean, for each Hotel, the difference, if any, by which (i) the
Adjusted Estimated Total Working Capital for such Hotel is less than (ii) the
Initial Required Working Capital for such Hotel. If the Adjusted Estimated
Total Working Capital for any Hotel is less than $0, Purchaser shall fund the
amount of such Adjusted Estimated Total Working Capital deficit at Closing and
shall also fund the applicable Initial Required Working Capital for such
Hotel. If the Adjusted Estimated Total Working Capital for any Hotel is less
than $0 and the Initial Required Working Capital for such Hotel is less than
$0,  



 

-17-  Purchaser shall fund the amount equal to the difference between the negative
Adjusted Estimated Total Working Capital and the negative Initial
Required Working Capital at Closing. _Adjusted Estimated Total Working
Capital_ shall mean, for each Hotel, the amount equal to (i) the Estimated
Total Working Capital for such Hotel, minus (ii) the value of the
Miscellaneous Operating Supplies included in the calculation of the Estimated
Total Working Capital for such Hotel. _Initial Required Working Capital_ shall
mean, with respect to each Hotel, the amount set forth on _Schedule 3.3(b)_
for such Hotel. Marriott and Purchaser shall recalculate the Estimated Total
Working Capital utilizing the definition of Working Capital set forth in this
Agreement for all purposes and calculations contemplated in this Section
3.2(b).



(c) At Closing, with respect to the Westchester Renaissance only, the
Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be further adjusted by a reduction equal to
the product of (i) the amount of all trade receivables that are aged 60 days
or more, times (ii) 0.85 (the "Aged Receivables"). To make such
adjustment, Marriott shall provide a list of such Aged Receivables, with
specific identification of same. Subsequent to Closing, the parties agree that
to the extent the Aged Receivables are collected, such amounts shall not be
included as part of the revenues of the Westchester Renaissance, but rather
shall be paid directly to Marriott. The parties agree that the staff of the
Westchester Renaissance may be used to collect such receivables, as part of
their ordinary course of duties and without prioritization of such
receivables over any others. Marriott shall be responsible for tracking
payment of the Aged Receivables and shall collect only upon payment of
specific Aged Receivables. The foregoing provisions may, at the election of
either party, be included in the Hotel Management Agreement for the
Westchester Renaissance.



_Section 3.4_ _Post-Closing Adjustments_. Section 3.3 of the CTF Agreement
contemplates that, and provides a procedure for, CTF and Marriott to arrive at
certain post-closing adjustments to the Working Capital. Marriott and
Purchaser shall recalculate the Estimated Total Working Capital utilizing the
definition of Working Capital set forth in this Agreement for all purposes and
calculations contemplated in this Section 3.4. Marriott, with the assistance
of Purchaser, shall prepare, and submit, the Closing Statements defined and
described in Section 3.3 of the CTF Agreement including information and
documentation provided by Purchaser within sufficient time in order for
Marriott to comply with the time requirements set forth in Section 3.3 of the
CTF Agreement. Upon receipt of the final report from the Accounting Firm as
described in Section 3.3(c) of the CTF Agreement, which such report shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto, either Marriott shall cause CTF to
transfer to Purchaser or Purchaser shall transfer to CTF, as the case may be,
by wire transfer as described in Section 3.3(c) of the CTF Agreement, the
difference between the adjustments made to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
(pursuant to Section 3.3 above) and the amounts set forth in the Closing
Statements (as may be adjusted by the Accounting Firm), along with interest as
set forth in Section 3.3(c) of the CTF Agreement.



 

-18- _Section 3.5_ _Certain Transaction Costs_.



(a) For the Hotels listed on _Schedules 2.1(a)_ and  _(c)_ , CTF shall be
allocated one-half of the Transfer Taxes which would be payable if such Hotels
were transferred pursuant to the Target Sale at the Preliminary Allocated
Price. For the Hotels listed on _Schedule 2.1(b)_ , CTF shall be allocated
one-half of the Transfer Taxes payable pursuant to the Lease Assignment and Sale
at the Preliminary Allocated Price. _Schedule 3.5_ sets forth the parties
initial estimate of the Transfer Taxes to be incurred in connection with the
Fee Sale, Target Sale and Lease Assignment and Sale as well as the estimated
amount thereof to be allocated to CTF and Purchaser. _Schedule 3.5_ shall be
adjusted by CTF, Marriott and Purchaser from time-to-time until the Closing
to reflect any elections made by Marriott under the CTF Agreement and
calculations made by the Title Company based upon the actual amount of
Transfer Taxes due and payable in the applicable jurisdictions as of the
Closing Date.



(b) Regardless of Law or convention, it shall be the responsibility of
Purchaser to pay or cause to be paid all Transfer Taxes and otherwise complete
and file all Tax Returns in connection therewith in a timely manner. Marriott
shall, and shall cause CTF to, cooperate with Purchaser as
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the preparation and
filing of such Tax Returns. The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced at
Closing by the total amount of Transfer Taxes allocated to CTF that are
actually paid or payable by Purchaser, and the Preliminary Allocated Price
related to each Hotel Interest affected thereby shall be reduced accordingly.



_Section 3.6_ _Structural and Environmental Consultants_. Marriott has
retained third party consultants (the " _Structural and Environmental
Consultants_ ") to perform structural and environmental analyses of the Hotels
and Marriott has provided Purchaser with copies of all of the reports and work
product prepared by the Structural and Environmental Consultants with regard
to the Hotels. Marriott shall cause the Structural and Environmental
Consultants to provide letters authorizing the Purchaser to rely upon the
reports, work product, representations and warranties provided by the
Structural Environmental Consultants. At Closing, in addition to payment of
the Purchase Price, Purchaser shall reimburse Marriott for the cost of all of
the work performed by the Structural and Environmental Consultants with
respect to the Hotels.



_Section 3.7_ _Purchase Price Allocation_.



(a) The parties have agreed upon the amount of the Preliminary Allocated
Price for CTFs interest in each of the Hotels and Minority Owned Entities,
which amounts are set forth on _Schedules 2.1(a)-(d)_. By written notice to
Marriott given not less than fourteen (14) Business Days prior to the
Closing, Purchaser may modify the Preliminary Allocated Price for any such
interest within the range permitted in _Schedules 2.1(a)-(d)_ , as applicable
(each such Preliminary Allocated Price as modified in the " _Closing
Allocated Price_ "), _provided_ , _however_ , that the total amount of all
Closing Allocated Prices shall at all times equal the Unadjusted Purchase
Price as it may be  



 

-19-  adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Closing Allocated
Price of each property shall be set forth on _Schedules 2.1(a)-(d)_ which
shall be delivered by Purchaser to Marriott two (2) Business Days prior to
Closing, provided, however, that to the extent such allocations result in an
increase in Transfer Taxes allocated to CTF as set forth on _Schedule 3.5_ of
the CTF Agreement, such difference shall be borne by the Purchaser. In the
event of any purchase price adjustment hereunder, Marriott and Purchaser agree
to adjust any previously agreed purchase price allocation to reflect such
purchase price adjustment and to file subsequent Tax Returns consistent with
such agreed allocation.



(b) The Purchaser and Marriott agree that the Closing Allocated Price for each
Hotel Interest shall be adjusted to reflect the Adjusted Purchase Price as
determined at the Closing. For each Hotel Interest, the purchase of which is
treated as an asset purchase for United States federal income tax purposes,
the Adjusted Purchase Price, as so adjusted, plus any liabilities attributable
to such Hotel Interest that are liabilities for United States tax purposes,
shall be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the assets acquired
thereby as agreed to by the parties and, if no agreement is reached, as
reasonably determined by each of the parties. Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, the Purchaser and Marriott and each of their Affiliates,
shall file all Tax Returns, consistent with the Closing Allocated Price
adjusted to take into account purchase price adjustments at the Closing and
with any other allocation that is agreed in respect of a particular Hotel
Interest. In the event of any purchase price adjustment hereunder, Marriott
and the Purchaser agree to adjust any previously agreed Purchase Price
allocation to reflect such purchase price adjustment and to file Tax Returns
consistent with such agreed allocation.



_Section 3.8_ _Closing_.



(a) The closing of the Transactions shall take place at a closing (the "
_Closing_ ") to be held at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 200
Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166, at 10:00 A.M., or at such other place
as CTF, Marriott and Purchaser may agree in writing.



(b) The Closing shall occur on June 17, 2005, _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the conditions to Closing of Marriott or Purchaser have not been satisfied as
of that date, or upon notice given by Purchaser no later than June 7, 2005,
or by Marriott no later than June 8, 2005, then the Closing shall occur not
later than June 30, 2005, _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , if all the
conditions of both parties to the Closing have been satisfied, except that
CTF shall not have received the requisite consent pursuant to the Offer and
Solicitation to allow for the release of the liens on the Property securing
the Notes, as more fully set forth in Article 4 of the CTF Agreement and as
those terms are described and defined in the CTF Agreement, and Marriott
exercises its one-time option to postpone the Closing to November 15, 2005
under Section 3.11 of the CTF Agreement, then the Closing hereunder shall also
be postponed until November 15, 2005; _provided further still_ , _however_ ,
if the Closing with respect to any Hotel is delayed in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the Closing for such Hotel shall occur as soon as  



 

-20-  practicable following the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing with
respect to such Hotel. The day on which a Closing takes place is referred to
as the " _Closing Date_."



(c) If the Closing does not occur by June 30, 2005, because CTF did not
receive the requisite consent as described in Section 3.8(b), and after
Purchaser provides written notice to Marriott no later than July 6, 2005 of
Purchasers intention to postpone Closing to November 15, 2005, Marriott
elects not to exercise its one-time option to postpone the Closing to November
15, 2005 pursuant to Section 3.11 of the CTF Agreement and Marriott elects
instead to terminate the CTF Agreement, but Purchaser is ready, willing and
able to close on June 30, 2005, then Marriott will refund the Deposit and all
interest thereon to Purchaser and pay Purchaser, Purchasers Out of Pocket
Costs not to exceed Two Million and No/100 Dollars ($2,000,000). Failure on
the part of Purchaser to notify Marriott on or before July 6, 2005 of its
intention to postpone Closing, shall be deemed Purchasers election not to
postpone Closing and not to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Article 12_  hereof. Purchaser being ready, willing and able to close for
the purposes of this Section 3.8 shall mean that Purchaser shall have (i)
satisfied the condition to Marriotts obligation to close set forth in Section
9.4(a), (ii) tendered all of Purchasers Closing Deliveries, and (iii) shall
have funding commitments for the payment of the entire Purchase Price such
that Purchaser would have been in a position to pay the entire Purchase Price
had the Closing occurred on June 30, 2005 and all conditions under this
Agreement to Purchasers obligations had been satisfied. As used herein, "
_Purchaser s Out of Pocket Costs_" means all Purchasers third party out-of-
pocket costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, all travel costs
and expenses, all amounts expended by Purchaser for its investigation of the
Hotels, including consulting fees and costs and legal fees and costs, all
amounts expended by Purchaser, including, but not limited to, legal fees and
costs, in the negotiation of this Agreement, the CTF Agreement, the management
agreement with Marriott, and the other documents and instruments in connection
with this Transaction, and all fees and costs (including costs incurred
to lock or cap rates of interest) paid by Purchaser to its lenders and
potential lenders, including all amounts expended as liquidated damages to the
lenders.



(d) If a Closing occurs after June 17, 2005 with respect to Hotels included in
such Closing:



(i) all of the Transactions shall be deemed to be effective as of Marriotts
most recently ended Accounting Period prior to the Closing Date (for such
Closing, the " _Effective Date_ ");



(ii) Purchaser shall pay daily interest on the sum of the Preliminary
Allocated Price of the Hotels from and including the Effective Date but not
including the Closing Date, at a rate equal to the Closing Interest Rate; and



(iii) with respect to the Hotels located in the United States, Marriott shall
cause CTF to, or the Purchaser shall, as the case may be, account and pay for
the difference between (x) all deposits to CTFs bank accounts  



 

-21-  arising from Hotel operations from the close of business on the Effective
Date through the Closing Date, and (y) all checks issued, wire transfers and
other disbursements from CTFs bank accounts arising from Hotel operations
from the close of business on the Effective Date through the Closing Date,
which would have been disbursed by Marriott if the Closing had occurred on the
Effective Date (the " _Cash True-Up_ ").



(e) On or before a Closing, (i) the Purchaser shall deliver to the Title
Company by wire transfer to a bank escrow account specified by the Title
Company the amount of the Adjusted Purchase Price for the Hotels included in
the Closing less the amount of Deposit (unless such Deposit will continue to
be held by the Title Company pursuant to _Schedule 9.2(d)_ ) and all interest
accrued thereon in immediately available funds in United States dollars (such
amount to be shown on a settlement memorandum detailing required adjustments
to the Unadjusted Purchase Price) and such other sums required to be paid by
Purchaser hereunder, including Transfer Taxes and other costs of Closing, (ii)
Marriott shall deliver to the Title Company Marriotts Closing Deliveries and
all other documents required by the Purchaser of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement to be delivered by Marriott and such other parties as are
necessary and appropriate, each such Deliveries and/or document to be
executed by Marriott and such other parties as are necessary and appropriate
and to be held in escrow by the Title Company, and (iii) the Purchaser shall
deliver to the Title Company the Purchasers Closing Deliveries and all other
documents required by the Purchaser under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement to be delivered by the Purchaser, each such Deliveries and/or
document to be executed by the Purchaser and to be held in escrow by the Title
Company following completion of the matters specified in (d)(i)-(iii) above,
and upon the joint written direction of Marriott and Purchaser, the Adjusted
Purchase Price and/or documents so held in escrow shall be released from
escrow and disbursed and/or distributed to those Persons entitled thereto,
including to those Persons required pursuant to all Ancillary Agreements. In
addition, Marriott and Purchaser shall cooperate to develop procedures for the
flow of funds at each Closing.

any business other than the ownership and operation of the business of a Hotel
and operations  



 

-24-  incidental thereto. Each Target has conducted its business in all material
respects in accordance with its Organizational Documents.

Practices Liabilities (clauses (i)-(iii), collectively being the " _Excluded
Liabilities_ " except for liabilities or obligations reflected on or reserved
against in the Balance Sheet with respect to such Target and except to the

with respect to the insurance proceeds, such that they are not available
for restoration of the Property or assignment to Purchaser, the Preliminary
Allocated Price of the related Hotel shall be reduced by the amount of the
proceeds taken by such lender. Insurance proceeds for business interruption
losses shall be applied to such losses and shall not be counted against
property casualty losses.

addressed to (i) in the case of a Lease Assignment and Sale, the Purchaser, or

Authority with respect to any of the Hotels that arise post-Closing but relate

business and within the control of the Purchaser occurring on the Closing Date
after the Closing, (b) any and all Taxes imposed on any of the Hotels, or

includes (but does not end on) the Effective Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "),
the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of a Hotel
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Effective
Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity in which the Hotels owner holds a beneficial interest
shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of a
Hotel for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Effective Date and the denominator of which is
the number of days in such Straddle Period. The benefits of lower tax brackets
and other similar benefits shall be apportioned in making the  



 

-51-  calculation of such allocated portions on the basis of the number of days in
the Purchasers and Marriotts holding periods for the taxable
period beginning before and ending after the Effective Date.

tax matter that is Marriotts responsibility under Section 8.2 within
ten (10) days from the receipt by the Purchaser of any written notice of such
Contest, but no failure to give such notice shall relieve Marriott of any
liability hereunder. Unless Marriott has previously received written notice
from the Purchaser of the existence of such Contest, Marriott shall give
written notice to the Purchaser of the existence of any Contest for which the
Purchaser has responsibility within ten (10) days from the receipt by Marriott

matter arising in a period ending on or before the Effective Date, to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense and to control the conduct of such
Contest, including settlement or other disposition thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall have the right to consult with Marriott
regarding any such Contest that may affect such Hotel for any periods ending
after the Effective Date at the Purchasers own expense and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any settlement or other disposition of any such Contest may
only be with the consent of the Purchaser, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



_Section 8.6_   _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Purchaser, on the one hand,
and Marriott, on the other, agree, in each case at no cost to the other party,
to cooperate with the other and the others Representatives in a prompt and
timely manner in connection with any Contest. Such cooperation shall include,
but not be limited to, making available to the other party, during normal
business hours, all books, records, Tax Returns, documents, files, other
information (including working papers and schedules), officers or employees
(without substantial interruption of employment) or other relevant information
necessary or useful in connection with any Contest requiring any such books,
records and files. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and Marriott, on the
other, agree, in each case at no cost to the other party, to cooperate fully
in a prompt and timely manner with the other and the others Representatives,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 8.1 and in connection with
any Contest. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
partys request) the provision of records and information which
are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Contest and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Marriott
agrees (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Taxes pertinent to
the Hotels relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until 90 days following the expiration of the period of limitations applicable

into with any Tax authority, other than those books and records relating to
the Hotels which the Purchaser shall provide to Marriott on or before the
Closing Date; and (iii) to give the Purchaser reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any  



 

-52-  such books and records and, if the Purchaser so requests, Marriott shall
allow the Purchaser to take possession of such books and records. Marriott and
the Purchaser further agree, upon request, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
governmental authority as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby).



_Section 8.7_ _Price Adjustment_. All amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement
by one party to another party (other than interest payments) shall be treated
by such parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, to the extent
appropriate and permitted by law.



_Section 8.8_ _After-Tax Basis_. All payments due in respect of Non-United
States Taxes under this Article 8 shall be fully adjusted to reflect (i) any
net increase in Taxes that the recipient of such payments will experience as
a result of receiving such payments, (ii) any net increase in Taxes such
recipient will experience as a result of receiving any gross-up payments under
this Section 8.8 and (iii) any net Tax benefits that the recipient will incur
as a result of the payment of the indemnified tax.



_Section 8.9_   _Elections_. Marriott and its Affiliates shall cooperate
fully with the Purchaser, to the extent necessary and to the extent reasonably
requested by the Purchaser, in connection with the filing of any elections
relating to Taxes which become available to the Purchaser or its Affiliates
as a result of the transactions described in this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Marriott and its Affiliates shall not be obligated to consent
to an election if such election would increase the amount of Taxes it is
required to pay unless the parties otherwise agree.



_Section 8.10_ _Survival_. All obligations under this Article 8 shall survive
the Closing hereunder and continue until 90 days following the expiration of
the period of limitations applicable to the related Tax. If a Tax claim that
is raised by one party during the survival period is disputed by the other
party, such claim shall survive the dispute between the parties is resolved.



_ARTICLE 9_. _TITLE COMMITMENT AND SURVEY REVIEW PROCESS; CONDITIONS TO
CLOSING_.



_Section 9.1_ _Title Commitment and Survey Review Process_. 



(a) _Title Review Process_. Purchaser and Marriott have each initiated the
title review process consisting of, with respect to the Leased Real Property,
the Owned Real Property and the real property owned by any Minority Owned
Entity located in the United States (the " _Real Properties_ "), (A) ordering
from the Title Company a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement search
including a search on any Target and a commitment for owners title insurance,
on such policy form as is available in the applicable jurisdiction as
selected by Purchaser, and (B) ordering from Bock and Clark Corporation National
Surveyors Network (" _Surveyor_ ") an ALTA survey with such instructions
regarding information to be shown and the scope of certification as Purchaser
shall determine. The Uniform Commercial Code financing statement search
results and  



 

-53-  the title commitments and surveys obtained by Purchaser, as revised or
updated from time to time, are herein referred to as " _Title Materials_."
Copies of all Title Materials shall be provided to Marriotts counsel as and
when received, which copies shall not be required to be returned. During the
period from the date of this Agreement and ending at 11:59 pm May 3, 2005
(the " _Objection Period_ "), Purchaser shall notify Marriott in writing of
those matters relating to title disclosed to Purchaser in the Title Materials
or otherwise disclosed in materials received by Purchaser at least forty-
eight (48) hours prior to 11:59 pm, May 3, 2005 to which Purchaser objects
(including, for example, the size or configuration of any Real Properties
which are not acceptable to Purchaser), and that are not Permitted
Encumbrances set forth in items (b)-(e) of the definition thereof
(collectively, the " _Purchaser s Objections_"). As to matters relating to
title disclosed in the Title Materials or otherwise disclosed in materials
received by Purchaser within forty-eight (48) hours prior to 11:59 pm, May 3,
2005, Purchaser shall notify Marriott in writing of its Title Objections
within forty-eight (48) hours of its receipt of such materials, but in no
event later than 11:59 pm, May 5, 2005. Purchaser shall endeavor to deliver
the Purchasers Objections in a reasonably expeditious manner and on a
property-by-property basis commencing no later than the date hereof and
thereafter as soon as reasonably practical after the date Purchaser receives
the applicable portion of the Title Materials. Purchaser shall not be deemed
to waive its right to make Purchasers Objections even if Purchasers
Objections are not made in a reasonably expeditious manner so long as
Purchasers Objections are made during the Objection Period. At Closing
Purchaser shall reimburse Marriott for all costs and expenses incurred or
expended by Marriott to the Title Company and/or Surveyor in connection with
obtaining the Title Materials with regard to the Real Properties.



(b) _Title Policies_. Prior to the expiration of the Objection Period,
Purchaser shall obtain from the Title Company, with respect to the Leased Real
Property and the Owned Real Property, in all jurisdictions where available, a
commitment to insure accompanied by a Pro Forma title policy, in form
acceptable to Purchaser (each, a " _Pro Forma_ "). Each Pro Forma shall be
written on an ALTA Form B (1970, amended 10/17/70, or if the 1970, amended
10/17/70 form is not available, the 1992 form with no creditors rights
exclusion (except in States or jurisdictions where such form or deletion is
not permitted)) or on such similar form as is available in the applicable
jurisdiction, insuring extended owners title coverage and shall evidence
Title Company commitment, upon compliance with the Title Companys
requirements as set forth in the Title Companys commitments to insure (the "
_Requirements_ "), to insure title to the Real Property that is the subject
of any Pro Forma, subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances. The Pro Formas
shall be in form and substance acceptable to Purchaser, and shall include all
endorsements reasonably required by Purchaser. Purchaser shall deliver all
Pro Formas and Requirements (including the form of any affidavits or
certifications required to be executed by Marriott or CTF in satisfaction of a
Requirement) to Marriotts counsel no later than the expiration of the
Objection Period.



(c) _Title Cure Period_. Upon the termination of the Objection Period, except
for the Purchasers Objections if the same are timely raised, the Purchaser
shall be deemed to have accepted the form and substance of all matters
disclosed in the Title  



 

-54-  Materials which shall become Permitted Encumbrances for all purposes under
the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Following the
Objection Period, and without any obligation to do so, Marriott shall have
until May 16, 2005, or by delivery of written notice to Purchaser by Marriott,
until such later date, but not beyond May 23, 2005 (as such date may have been
extended, the " _Title Cure Period_ ") to cause CTF to elect to cure or elect
not to cure any or all matters raised in Purchasers objections; _provided_ ,
_however_ , CTF agrees to have released by Closing the liens securing any
Debt that is not to be assumed by Marriott or Purchaser pursuant to the terms
of the CTF Agreement or this Agreement, as applicable. If CTF elects to cure
such Title Objections, the cure must be sufficient for the Title Company to
remove the applicable Title Objection from the exceptions to title set forth
in the applicable Pro Forma.



(d) _Termination of Title Cure Period_. If, for any reason, CTF is unable or
at CTFs sole election, unwilling to take such actions as may be required to
cause the matter identified in Purchasers Objections to be cured or removed
so as to convey title to the Real Properties consistent with the Pro Formas,
or if CTF objects to any Requirement or any other obligation which it may
incur in connection with the issuance of the Pro Forma title policies,
Marriott shall give Purchaser notice thereof prior to the expiration of the
Title Cure Period; it being understood and agreed that the failure of Marriott
to timely give such notice shall be deemed an election by CTF not to remedy
such matters. If CTF shall elect not (or be deemed to elect not) to remove any
matter identified in Purchasers Objections, Purchaser may, in the exercise of
its sole discretion either: (i) close the Transaction with respect to the
Real Properties subject to the Purchasers Objections (that CTF will not cure)
without abatement of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, in which event: (A) the
Purchasers Objections that CTF will not cure shall be, and be deemed to be,
for all purposes, Permitted Encumbrances; (B) the Purchaser shall close the
Transactions notwithstanding the existence of any of the Purchasers
Objections that CTF will not cure; and (C) neither CTF nor Marriott shall
have any obligation or liability whatsoever after the Closing with respect to
CTFs failure to cause any of the Purchasers Objections to be eliminated; or
(ii) terminate this Agreement by written notice given to Marriott within four
(4) calendar days after expiration of the Title Cure Period, in which event
this Agreement shall terminate, the Deposit and all interest accrued thereon
shall be returned to Purchaser and neither party hereto shall have
any further obligations thereunder other than those obligations expressly
stated herein to survive the termination of this Agreement. In the event
Purchaser elects to proceed to Closing, the Pro Formas shall be revised to (1)
delete those Requirements objected to by CTF and (2) add Purchasers
Objections that CTF will not cure so that the Pro Formas shall be consistent
with the quality of title accepted or deemed accepted by the Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 9.1(d).



(e) _Requirement to Eliminate Purchaser s Objections; Requirement to Remove
Liens Additional Title Matters_. It is expressly understood that unless CTF
expressly agrees, in the exercise of its sole discretion, to cure or remove a
matter identified in the Purchasers Objections prior to Closing, neither CTF
nor Marriott shall be required to bring any action, institute any proceeding,
or otherwise incur any costs or expenses in order to attempt to eliminate any
of the Purchasers Objections or to  



 

-55-  otherwise cause title to the Real Properties to comport with the terms of
this Agreement on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Marriott shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause CTF to remove (i)
any liens that are filed against the Real Properties during the period after
the expiration of the Title Cure Period and before Closing but only if they
are recorded by CTF or caused by CTFs actions or failure to act; and (ii)
any liens securing Debt not assumed by the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement or under the terms of the CTF Agreement. Should matters relative to
title, other than liens CTF is obligated to remove pursuant to the preceding
sentence, be discovered from any update of the Title Materials received by
Purchaser or otherwise after the expiration of the Objection Period that were
not disclosed in the Title Materials received by the Purchaser prior to the
expiration of the Objection Period (collectively, the " _New Title Matters_
"), the Purchaser shall have the right to notify Marriott in writing of any
new Title Matters which are not Permitted Encumbrances set forth in items
(b)-(e) of the definition thereof to which the Purchaser objects provided that
Purchaser notifies Marriott in writing of its objection within twenty-four
(24) hours after such matter is disclosed to Purchaser. Marriott shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause CTF to remove any New Title Matters
that are filed against any of the Real Properties during the period after the
expiration of the Title Cure Period and before Closing but only if they are
recorded by CTF or caused by CTFs actions or failure to act. With respect to
all other new Title Matters, Marriott shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to cause CTF within five (5) days after receipt of notice of the New
Title Matters, to advise Marriott whether CTF will cure such New Title
Matters prior to the Closing Date and Marriott will promptly notify Purchaser
of CTFs response. Should CTF fail to cure or remove prior to the Closing Date
any New Title Matter which is objected to by Purchaser, and should such New
Title Matter materially and adversely impair the value or use of any of the
Real Properties to which such objection relates, such failure shall constitute
a failure of a condition to Purchasers obligation to proceed to Closing with
respect to the Real Properties affected by such New Title Matters, and
Purchaser may, at its election, determine not to close with respect to such
Real Properties. All other New Title Matters which are not cured or removed by
CTF shall be deemed waived by the Purchaser and shall constitute Permitted
Encumbrances for all purposes under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements. If the Purchaser elects not to close with respect to any Real
Properties in accordance with Section 9.1(e), in such case, the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Preliminary Allocated Price
applicable to any such Real Properties.



(f) _Related Fees, Cost and Expenses_. All the fees, costs and expenses
associated with the Purchasers procurement, preparation, delivery and review
of the Title Materials, the issuance of title policies and any endorsements
related thereto shall be for the account of the Purchaser pursuant to Section
13.1 herein.



(g) _Marriott Assurance_. Marriott covenants and agrees to cooperate with the
Purchaser in connection with the Title Materials and the title review process
and will cause CTF to provide such affidavits or other documents and
information as Purchaser may reasonably require in order to obtain
affirmative endorsements or other assurances available under local practice
as the Purchaser may require, including  



 

-56-  non-imputation endorsements, where applicable, _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) all of the foregoing requirements are commercially reasonable,
(ii) Marriott shall not be obligated to cause CTF to provide any affidavit,
certification or indemnification to the Title Company that causes CTF to incur
any liability in excess of CTFs liability under the CTF Agreement, and (iii)
Marriott shall not be obligated to cause CTF to provide any affidavit,
certification or indemnification with respect to the Minority Owned Entities.



(h) _Form of Fee Sale Transfer and Conveyance Documents_. Seven (7) days prior
to the expiration of the Objection Period, Purchaser shall forward to
Marriott the proposed form of the deeds, bills of sale, assignments,
certificates, affidavits and such other instruments and documents (excluding
any documents previously provided in connection with the Requirements)
(collectively, " _Proposed Conveyance Documents_ ") as may be reasonably
necessary in order to consummate the Transactions and facilitate the issuance
by the Title Company of the title insurance policies reasonably requested by
Purchaser and facilitate the obtaining of other commercially reasonable
assurances available under local practice. Marriott and Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to agree upon the final form of the Proposed
Conveyance Documents on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser and Marriott
acknowledge and agree that the warranty of title set forth in the various
deeds and other conveyancing documents shall be in accordance with the
commercially reasonable customary practices of the applicable
jurisdictions but in all cases sufficient to enable the Title Company to
issue the title policies in the forms of the Pro Formas. The warranties of
title contained in the various deeds shall not be subject to the provision of
Section 10.8(b) of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed as
requiring Marriott to cause CTF to make any representations, warranties or
covenants in the Proposed Conveyance Documents other than those contained in
Article 5 and Article 7 of the CTF Agreement.



_Section 9.2_ _Lack of Consents or Estoppels for Certain
Leasehold Interests_.



(a) Matters concerning the consents for the Transfer of the interests in the
Minority Owned Entities are addressed in _Schedule 9.2(d)_.



(b) If any Estoppel Certificate satisfying the requirements of Section 7.9(d)
is not obtained prior to the Closing Date or if obtained, contains
information which is inconsistent with Marriotts representations and
warranties set forth herein in Article 5 and 5A, then Purchaser shall elect to
either: (i) proceed with Closing with respect to the applicable Hotel or
Hotels and waive any right to require the receipt of an Estoppel Certificate
and the right to make a claim for indemnification under Article 10 based upon
the facts or circumstances disclosed by the applicable Estoppel Certificate,
or (ii) elect not to proceed with Closing with respect to the applicable
Hotel or Hotels (in which case the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the Preliminary Allocated Price for such Hotel or Hotels) in
order to permit Marriott a period of time during which to attempt to obtain
an Estoppel Certificate in the form required hereby. In the event that
Purchaser elects under clause (ii) above to permit Marriott additional time to
obtain an Estoppel Certificate and Marriott fails to deliver an
Estoppel Certificate satisfying the requirements of Section 7.9(e) to
Purchaser prior to December 31, 2005, then Purchaser  



 

-57-  shall either (A) elect not to proceed to Closing with respect to the
applicable Hotel or Hotels or (B) shall proceed to consummate the Transaction
with respect to the applicable Hotel and shall retain any rights it may have
under the indemnification provisions of Article 10.



_Section 9.3_ _General Conditions_. The respective obligations of the
Purchaser and Marriott to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be subject to the fulfillment, at or prior to the
Closing, of each of the following conditions, any of which may, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, be waived in writing by either party in its sole
discretion ( _provided_ , that such waiver shall only be effective as to the
obligations of such party):



(a) No Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any Law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent),
that is then in effect and that enjoins, restrains, makes illegal or otherwise
prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements.



(b) Any waiting period (and any extension thereof) under any antitrust laws
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements shall have expired or shall have been terminated. All
other material consents of, or registrations, declarations or filings with,
any Governmental Authority legally required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall
have been obtained or filed or (with respect to liquor licenses) shall be in
the process of being obtained and Marriott shall be responsible for the
process with respect to liquor licenses such that there will be no
interruption in the sale of liquor at the Hotels being purchased by Purchaser.



(c) Closing under the CTF Agreement with respect to the Hotels shall have
occurred or shall occur simultaneously with Closing hereunder.



_Section 9.4_ _Conditions to the Obligations of Marriott_. The obligations of
Marriott to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be subject to the fulfillment, at or prior to the Closing, of each the
following conditions, any of which may be waived in writing by Marriott in its
sole discretion:



(a) The Purchaser shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations and agreements and complied in all material respects with all
covenants and conditions required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it prior to or at the Closing and Marriott shall have
received from the Purchaser a certificate to such effect, signed by a duly

-59- _ARTICLE 10_. _INDEMNIFICATION_.



_Section 10.1_ _Pass-Through Representations_.



(a) The representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1 through 4.17
hereof are substantially identical to those certain representations and
warranties made by CTF to Marriott in Sections 5.1 through 5.17 of the CTF
Agreement (the " _Pass_ _Through Representations_ "). Purchaser acknowledges
that Marriott may have no direct or actual knowledge of the facts contained in
certain of the Pass Through Representations and that except as set forth in
Section 5.18A, Marriott is relying exclusively on the correctness of the
Pass Through Representations of CTF in making the Pass Through
Representations to Purchaser. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
Marriotts liability to Purchaser for any Breach of the Pass Through
Representations shall be limited to the actual monetary damages or other
relief received by Marriott based on the breach of the Pass Through
Representations by CTF. Except as set forth in this Section 10.1(a)-10.1(b),
Marriott shall have no liability or obligation to Purchaser for any Breach
by Marriott of the Pass Through Representations.



(b) Upon the occurrence of a Breach of the Pass Through Representations and
upon Purchaser making a claim against Marriott, Marriott shall exercise any
and all rights and remedies available to Marriott under the CTF Agreement or
at law or in equity (i) to bring against CTF a claim for indemnification and
institute litigation to enforce such claim to the same extent as made by
Purchaser against Marriott (but only to, and in the manner permitted by the
CTF Agreement and subject to the limitations of Article 10 of the CTF
Agreement, which for the avoidance of doubt, exempts Tax matters from any such
limitations imposed by Article 10 of the CTF Agreement) (a " _Mirror Claim_
"); and (ii) to seek as damages in the Mirror Claim, all Losses of the
Purchaser arising from the Mirror Claim (but only to in the manner permitted
by this Agreement and subject to the limitations of Article 10 as aforesaid).
In taking any action against CTF, Purchaser shall have the right to select
counsel and to manage any and all claims, actions, causes of action and/or
litigation which Marriott may pursue in order to enforce its rights hereunder.
Marriott shall cooperate fully with Purchaser in Purchasers efforts
to enforce its right based on a Breach of the Pass Through Representations.
Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall pay all of Purchasers
reasonable expenses which Purchaser may suffer, incur or expend in its efforts
to enforce its rights against CTF, including, without limitation, reasonable
counsel fees, fees of experts, and court costs and may include such costs as a
part of its claim for damages.



_Section 10.2_ _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Indemnities_. The
representations, warranties and covenants of Marriott and the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until April 30, 2007,
provided, however, that the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 5.2, 5.3(a)-(e), 7.4 and 7.11 shall  



 

-60-  survive indefinitely. Survival of the representations and warranties in
Sections 5.16 and 5.16A shall be governed by the provisions of Section 8.9. 



_Section 10.3_ _Indemnification by Marriott_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article 10, Marriott shall save, defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser (including the Targets and their Subsidiaries) and the
respective Representatives, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing
(collectively, the _"Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any
and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating,
preparing or defending the foregoing) (hereinafter collectively, " _Losses_
"), incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing to the extent
arising out of or resulting from:



(a) any breach of any material representation or warranty made by Marriott
contained in this Agreement other than the Pass Through Representations set
forth in Section 5 of this Agreement;



(b) any breach of any material covenant or agreement by Marriott (hereinafter
the " _Marriott Covenants_ ") contained in this Agreement other than a
covenant by Marriott to cause CTF to perform in any stated manner;



(c) any Third Party Claim that arises from an event that occurs prior to
Closing regarding any Interest Holder other than (i) a liability reflected on
the Balance Sheet of such Target to the extent of the amount so reflected, or
(ii) any Assumed Liability and any other liability expressly assumed by
Purchaser under this Agreement to the extent of the amount so assumed;



(d) any liability for any brokers or investment banking fees of Marriott or
its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; and



(e) Marriotts actions or failure to take actions where required, all

and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or other similar state
laws, arising from the Transactions,



_Section 10.4_ _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. The Purchaser shall save,
defend, indemnify and hold harmless Marriott and its Affiliates and the
respective Representatives, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Marriott Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any
and all Losses incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the foregoing to
the extent arising out of or resulting from:



(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement;



 

-61- (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Purchaser contained in this
Agreement; 



(c) any Third Party Claim which arises from an event that occurs after the
Closing against any Marriott Indemnified Party with respect to the operations
or ownership of the Hotels or Hotel Interests except to the extent that such
claim was caused by a breach of Marriotts obligations and duties as manager
under the Hotel Management Agreements or with respect to which Marriott is
otherwise responsible pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Hotel
Management Agreements (in which event the terms and conditions of the
Hotel Management Agreements shall govern);



(d) any Assumed Liabilities;



(e) any claim for any brokers or investment banking fees of the Purchaser in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and



(f) arising other than from CTFs actions or failure to take actions where
required, all obligations, penalties, liabilities and expenses under the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or
other similar laws arising from the Transactions.



_Section 10.5_ _Procedures_.



(a) In order for a Purchaser Indemnified Party or Marriott Indemnified Party
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided
for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a Loss or
a claim or demand made by any Person other than Marriott and its Affiliates
and the Purchaser against the Indemnified Party, including a Mirror Claim (a
" _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof
to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the
Third Party Claim, but in no event later than the Claims Deadline, describing
in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification
hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim
(if known) and such other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying
Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide as part of the initial
written notice of claim, the information set forth in the preceding sentence
shall not invalidate the effectiveness of the written notice provided the
information is delivered in a reasonable time period thereafter. The failure
to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this Article 10 except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.



(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the
Indemnified Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim except as may
be provided to the contrary as to a Mirror Claim in which case Purchaser shall
bear all of the costs associated therewith, to assume the defense thereof at
the expense of the Indemnifying  



 

-62-  Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys
possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not
admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, or
offer to compromise, settle or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent unless the Indemnifying
Party withdraws from the defense of such Third Party Claim or unless a final
judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying
Party is entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such claims or
proceeding pursuant to this Section 10.5 and the Indemnified Party proposes to
settle such claims or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forgo
any appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume
the defense of such claims or proceeding. The Indemnifying Party and its
counsel shall conduct such defense or settlement in a manner reasonably
satisfactory and effective to protect the Indemnified Party fully. The
Indemnifying Party and its counsel shall keep the Indemnified Party
fully advised as to its conduct of such defense or settlement, and shall not
compromise or settle such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless
such settlement or compromise does not subject the Indemnified Party to any
monetary liability, includes a complete, unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim,
and does not constitute an acknowledgement or acceptance by the Indemnified
Party of fault, culpability, or responsibility of any kind. Notwithstanding
the Indemnifying Partys election to defend against or settle the Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party may, upon written notice to the Indemnifying
Party, elect to employ its own counsel and assume control of such defense or
settlement if (A) the Indemnifying Party is also a Person against whom the
Third Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith
that joint representation would be inappropriate; (B) the Indemnified Party
determines in good faith that the Indemnified Party may have available to its
one or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with, different
from, or in addition to one or more of those that may be available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim; (C) the
Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified
Party of its financial capacity to defend such Third Party Action; (D) the
Indemnifying Party shall not in fact have employed counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party for the defense or settlement of such
Third Party Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that the assumption of control
of the defense or settlement of a Third Party Action by the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this sentence shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligation to indemnify and hold the Indemnified Party harmless.



 

-63- (c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party
no later than the Claims Deadline, describing in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method
of computation of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request. The failure to provide as part of the initial written notice of
claim, the information set forth in the preceding sentence shall not
invalidate the effectiveness of the written notice provided the information is
provided in a reasonable time period thereafter. The failure to provide such
notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article 10 except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty
(30) days after receipt of notice of any claim pursuant to this Section
10.5(c) to (i) agree to the amount or method of determination set forth in
such claim and to pay such amount to such Indemnified Party or (ii) provide
the Indemnified Party with notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") that it disagrees
with the amount or method of determination set forth in such claim. If the
Indemnifying Party has timely delivered a Dispute Notice, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall, during a period 30 days from the
Indemnified Partys receipt of such Dispute Notice, negotiate to achieve
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations,
such dispute shall be resolved as provided in Section 12.9.



_Section 10.6_ _Limits on Indemnification_.



(a) No claim may be asserted against any party for breach of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement unless written notice
of such claim is received by such party describing in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim
on or prior to May 30, 2007 (the " _Claim Deadline_ ") in which case such
representation, warranty or covenant shall survive as to such claim until such
claim has been finally resolved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall
be no Claims Deadline applicable to a claim raised with respect to a breach of
Sections 5.2, 5.3(a)-(e), 7.4 and 7.11 hereof. In addition, no claim may be
asserted against Marriott for breach of any of CTFs or Marriotts
representations or warranties to the extent that the Title Materials contain
information that is inconsistent with such representations or warranties.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement with
respect to each Fee Property, Target, Leasehold Interest in a Minority Owned
Entity: (i) Marriott shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification of
$5,000 or less pursuant to Sections 10.1(a), 10.1(b), or 10.3 resulting from
any single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or
circumstances (the " _De Minimus Amount_ ", (ii) Marriott shall not be liable
unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may
be recovered from Marriott on account of all claims  



 

-64-  equals or exceeds $50,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "), at which time
Marriott shall be liable for all such Losses, (iii) the maximum
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered by Purchaser
Indemnified Parties arising out of or relating to the causes set forth in
Sections 10.3(a), 10.3(b) or 10.3(c) in relation to any single Fee Property,
Target, Leasehold Interest or in a Minority Owned Entity shall equal fifty
percent (50%) of the Preliminary Allocated Price in respect of such Fee
Property, Target, Leasehold Interest or in such a Minority Owned Entity, as
the case may be (the " _Indemnification Limit_ "); and (iv) no party hereto
shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any
punitive, consequential, incidental, special or indirect damages relating to
the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnification Limit applicable to Losses
related to a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant under Sections
5.2 and 5.3(a)-(e) shall be the Preliminary Allocated Price of each Target.



(c) For all purposes of this Article 10, "Losses" shall be net of (i) any
insurance (other than any self-insured retention program) or other recoveries
paid (subject to Section 10.8 by a third party to the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates in connection with the facts, events or circumstances giving rise
to the right of indemnification and (ii) any net Tax benefit available to such
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with the accrual,
incurrence or payment of any such Losses (including the net present value of
any Tax benefit arising in subsequent taxable years).



(d) The Purchaser and Marriott shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any Third Party claim with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making Commercially
Reasonably Efforts to mitigate such claim. In the event that the Purchaser or
Marriott shall fail to make such Commercially Reasonably Efforts to mitigate
or resolve any claim or liability, then notwithstanding anything else to
the contrary contained herein, the other party shall not be required to
indemnify any person to the extent of any loss, liability, claim, damage or
expense that could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the
Purchaser or Marriott, as the case may be, had made such efforts.



(e) For purposes of this Article 10, "Losses" shall be determined in all
cases without regard to any qualification or limitation with respect to
"materiality" whether by reference to "in any material respect" or any other
use of "material."



_Section 10.7_ _Tax Matters_. Anything in this Article 10 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be governed by Article 8.



_Section 10.8_ _Assignment of Claims_. If any Purchaser Indemnified Party
receives any payment from Marriott in respect of any Losses pursuant to
Section 10.3 and the Purchaser Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a
part of such Losses from a third party (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based
on the underlying claim asserted against Marriott, the Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall assign, on a non-recourse basis and without any representation or
warranty, such of its rights to proceed against the Potential  



 

-65-  Contributor as are necessary to permit Marriott to recover from the
Potential Contributor the amount of such payment. Any payment received in
respect of such claim shall be distributed, (i) first to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party in the amount of any deductible or similar amount required
to be paid by the Purchaser Indemnified Party prior to Marriott being required
to make any payment to the Purchaser Indemnified Party, (ii) second to
Marriott in an amount equal to the aggregate payments made by Marriott to the
Purchaser Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, plus costs and expenses
incurred in investigating, defending or otherwise incurred in connection with
addressing such claim and (iii) the balance, if any, to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party.



_Section 10.9_ _Disclaimer of Implied Warranties_.



(a) It is the explicit intent and understanding of each party hereto that
neither party hereto nor its Representatives is making any representation or
warranty whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, as to the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding the Property, except as expressly
set forth in this Agreement, and neither party hereto is relying on
any statement, representation or warranty, oral or written, express or
implied, made by the other party hereto or such other partys Representatives,
except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

 



(b) Each party hereto hereby agrees and acknowledges that with the exception
of the various deeds which will be placed of record in the applicable real
property records each of the conveyance documents contemplated hereunder and
under the CTF Agreement to consummate the Transaction shall explicitly
reflect the fact that the Purchaser is purchasing the applicable Owned Real
Property or Leased Real Property on an "as is" condition "with all faults" and
without any warranties, representations or guaranties of any kind, oral
or written, express or implied, concerning the Property from or on behalf of
Marriott or CTF, except as may be expressly set forth in the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as contemplated under Section 9.1(g). The
Purchaser acknowledges that, except as may be expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the conveyance documents contemplated hereunder and under the
CTF Agreement, Marriott has not, does not, and will not make any
representations, warranties or guaranties, of any kind, oral or written,
express or implied, concerning the Property including, without limitation (i)
the quality, adequacy, state of repair or physical condition of the Property,
(ii) the habitability, merchantability or fitness, suitability or adequacy of
the Property or any portion thereof for any particular use or purpose, (iii)
the zoning or other legal status of the Property, (iv) the compliance by the

environmental condition of the Property, including its compliance with
environmental laws and the presence or non-presence of hazardous substances.
At the Closing Purchaser shall execute and deliver a certificate to and for
the benefit of CTF and Marriott reflecting its acknowledgement of the
foregoing provisions.

_Section 11.1_ _Purchaser s Default_. Should Purchaser default under this
Agreement prior to Closing, Marriott shall be entitled (i) to retain the
Deposit, and (ii) to collect the sum of $5 million from Purchaser (which shall
become due and payable upon such default), collectively as liquidated damages
and terminate this Agreement (and the retention of the Deposit and such $5
million shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Marriott for such default)
in which event Purchaser shall have no rights under this Agreement or the CTF
Agreement, and Marriott shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
close under the CTF Agreement. Following Closing, in the event the Deposit is
retained by the Title Company pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 9.2(d)),
the provisions of subsection (ii) above shall have no further force or
effect.



_Section 11.2_   _Marriott s Default_.



(a) If all other parties, including CTF and the other purchaser of Hotels
under contract with Marriott to acquire such hotels, shall have fully
performed their respective obligations under this Agreement and any other

the CTF Agreement, and Marriott shall default hereunder, Purchaser shall be
entitled to receive from Marriott as its sole and exclusive remedy (i) a
refund of its Deposit and all interest earned thereon, (ii) Purchasers Out
of Pocket Costs, and (iii) a payment in the amount of Five Million Dollars

(i) a refund of its Deposit and all interest earned thereon and its
reasonable Purchasers Out of Pocket Costs not to exceed Two Million Dollars

CTF Agreement, Marriott shall determine which if any remedy it wishes to
pursue against CTF and shall provide to Purchaser notice of such
determination. Purchaser shall have a period of ten (10) days after receipt of
Marriotts determination within which to elect to participate in such action

any such litigation, Purchaser shall be entitled to its pro rata share of
damages in fact awarded to, and received by Marriott, and if such litigation

decree of the applicable court, the Hotels which are the subject of this
Agreement. For the purposes of this Section 11.2(c), the pro rata share of

Hotels which are the subject of this Agreement as compared with
the Unadjusted Purchase Price under the CTF Agreement, unless any such
damages as contemplated in this Section 11.2(c) shall be awarded based on
specific damage to a

to the party taking title to such Hotel. If Purchaser elects not to
participate in any such action, this Agreement shall terminate and neither
party shall have any further liability or obligation to the other under this
Agreement. In any event, all decisions as to the pursuit of remedies and the
prosecution of any litigation shall be made solely by Marriott.

Marriott either acquires the Hotels under the CTF Agreement or otherwise
transfers its right to acquire the Hotels under the CTF Agreement to a third
party, Purchaser shall have the right to specific performance as to this
Agreement; provided, however, Purchaser must (i) institute such action for
Specific Performance against Marriott within three (3) months from the first
date on which Purchaser first learns or discovers that Marriott has so
acquired the Hotels under the CTF Agreement or so transferred its rights under
the CTF Agreement and (ii) as a closing condition to the Purchaser of
such Hotels, repay to Marriott any sums previously paid by Marriott to
Purchaser for out-of-pocket expenses as provided in Sections 11.2(a) and
11.2(b) hereof less however Purchasers costs in pursuing such action for
specific performance against Marriott. In the event that an action for
specific performance is not available, Purchaser shall be entitled to a refund
of its Deposit and its reasonable third party out-of-pocket expenses not to
exceed $2,000,000 as liquidated damages.

this Agreement under this Section 11.1(c) shall not be available if the
