                                      -2-
<PAGE>

on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the
following securities, the following shall occur:

         (a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. In accordance with the
             ----------------------------------
Certificate of Designation of the Company, each share of Preferred Stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into
30.2526 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Company (the
"Company Common Stock"). Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares of
Preferred Stock converted into Company Common Stock, but excluding any share of
Company Common Stock to be canceled and extinguished pursuant to Section 1.6(b))
will be automatically converted (subject to Sections 1.6(e) and (f)) into 1.82
(the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share,
of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock"), which shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the "Merger Consideration." If any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject
to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any
applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with Company,
then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of
Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing
such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate
legends.

         (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common
             -----------------------------------
Stock held by Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.

         (c) Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans. At the Effective
             --------------------------------------------
Time, all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding under

Corporation 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, the Silicon Investor, Inc. 1996 Plan, the
Web 21 Stock Option Plan, the Haggle Online, Inc. Non-qualified Stock Option
Agreement and the IQC Option to Purchase Common Stock (collectively, the

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

"Company Option Plans"), and Company Option Plans themselves, shall be assumed

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") will be terminated in accordance with

             ---------------------------
value per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001 par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing
ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
             -----------------------------
to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock), extraordinary cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring or having a
record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

         (f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
             ------------------
will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder)
shall, upon surrender of such holder's Certificates(s) (as defined in Section
1.7(c)) receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole
cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied
by (ii) the average closing price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the
five (5) most recent days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the
trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time, as reported on the Nasdaq
National Market ("Nasdaq").

     1.7 Surrender of Certificates.
         -------------------------

         (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
             --------------
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the exchange
agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

         (b) Parent to Provide Common Stock. Promptly after the Effective Time,
             ------------------------------
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance
with this Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and
cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares
of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

          (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective
              -------------------
Time, and in no event later than fifteen (15) days thereafter, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective
Time) of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.6(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock into which their shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to
Section 1.6(a), payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holders have the
right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only
the ownership of the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which
such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted (including any
voting, notice or other rights associated with the ownership of such shares of
Parent Common Stock under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent
or under Delaware Law) and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the
issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f) and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

          (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Dividends or
              ------------------------------------------------
other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will
be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby when the holders of record of
such Certificates surrender such Certificates.

          (e) Transfers of Ownership. If certificates representing shares of
              ----------------------
Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons
requesting such exchange will have (i) paid to Parent or any agent designated by
it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or (ii)
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

          (f) Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
              --------------------
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder
of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or state, local or foreign law. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

          (g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
              ------------
Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     1.8  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of
          ---------------------------------------------------
Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any
cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Sections 1.6(f) and 1.7(d)) shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock. There shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article I.

     1.9  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any
          --------------------------------------
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section
1.6(a), cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to
Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.7(d); provided, however, that the Exchange Agent, may, in its discretion and
        --------  -------
as a condition precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock and the payment of cash and other distributions,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

assist such party in accounting for and reporting the Merger being so qualified.

          (b) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall qualify

purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger
Sub, Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise) to take all such
necessary action.

to any such Parent Plan. There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened by the IRS or the DOL with respect to
any Parent Plans. All contributions, reserves or premium payments required to be
made or accrued as of the date hereof to the Parent Plans have been timely made
or accrued. Any Parent Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code (i) has
either obtained a favorable determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion
letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status from the IRS or still has a
remaining period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination, and (ii) incorporates or has been
amended to incorporate all provisions required to comply with the Tax Reform Act
of 1986 and subsequent legislation. To the knowledge of Parent, no condition or
circumstance exists giving rise to a material likelihood that any such Parent
Plan

                                     -29-
<PAGE>

would not be treated as qualified by the IRS. Parent does not have any plan
or commitment to establish any new Parent Plan, to modify any Parent Plan
(except to the extent required by law or to conform any such Parent Plan to the
requirements of any applicable law, in each case as previously disclosed to
Company in writing, or as required by the terms of any Parent Plan or this
Agreement), or to enter into any new Parent Plan. Each Parent Plan can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms, without liability to Company, Parent or any of its
ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses).

          (c) Neither Parent, any of its subsidiaries, nor any of their ERISA
Affiliates has at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated
in, or contributed to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code and at no time has Parent contributed to or been requested to
contribute to any "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in ERISA.
Neither Parent, any of its subsidiaries, nor any officer or director of Parent
or any of its subsidiaries is subject to any material liability or penalty under
Section 4975 through 4980B of the Code or Title I of ERISA. No "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and
407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 4975 of the Code and
Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Parent Plan which could
subject Parent or its ERISA Affiliates to material liability.

          (d) None of the Parent Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person except as required by applicable
law, and neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has represented, promised or
contracted (whether in oral or written form) to provide such retiree benefits to
any Parent Employee, former employee, director, consultant or other person,
except to the extent required by statute.

          (e) Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect, Parent is in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable material foreign,
federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations respecting employment,
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours.

          (f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any
payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus
or otherwise) becoming due to any stockholder, director or Parent Employee or
any of its subsidiaries under any Parent Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Parent Plan, or (iii) result
in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

     3.13 Absence of Liens and Encumbrances.  Parent and each of its
          ---------------------------------
subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased properties
and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its material tangible
properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used in its business, free and
clear of any liens or encumbrances except as reflected in the Parent Financials
and except for liens for taxes not yet due and payable and such imperfections of
title and encumbrances, if any, which would not be material to Parent.

          ---------------------

          (a) Hazardous Materials Activities.  Except as would not reasonably be
              ------------------------------
likely to result in a material liability to Parent (in any individual case or in

stored, used, manufactured, disposed of, released or exposed its employees or
others to Hazardous Materials in violation of any law in effect on or before the
Closing Date, and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has engaged in

              -------------------------
proceeding, amendment procedure, writ, injunction or claim is pending, or to
Parent's knowledge, threatened concerning any Parent Permit relating to any
environmental matter, Hazardous Material or any Hazardous Materials Activity of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries.  Parent is not aware of any fact or
circumstance which could involve Parent or any of its subsidiaries in any
environmental litigation or impose upon Parent or any of its subsidiaries any
environmental liability.

     3.15 Labor Matters.  (i) There are no controversies pending or, to the
          -------------
knowledge of each of Parent and its respective subsidiaries, threatened, between
Parent or any of its subsidiaries and any of their respective employees which
could reasonably be expected to result in a cash payment obligation by Parent in
excess of $250,000; (ii) as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
any of its subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining agreement or
other labor union contract applicable to persons employed by Parent or its
subsidiaries nor does Parent or its subsidiaries know of any activities or
proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees; and (iii) as of
the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has any
knowledge of any strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages or lockouts, or threats
thereof, by or with respect to any employees of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries.

Parent and Company shall jointly prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC the

as



                                     -40-
<PAGE>

practicable after the date hereof, and, prior to the effective date of the S-4,
the parties hereto shall take all action required under any applicable laws in
connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger. Each of Parent and Company shall provide promptly to the other such
information concerning its business and financial statements and affairs as, in
the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be required
or appropriate for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-
4, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and cause its counsel and
auditors to cooperate with the other's counsel and auditors in the preparation
of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the S-4. As promptly as practicable
after the effective date of the S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
be mailed to the stockholders of Company and of Parent. Each of the parties
hereto shall cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to comply as to form and
substance with respect to such party in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, (ii) the Securities Act, (iii)
the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq. As promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, each of Company and Parent will prepare and file any
other filings required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act or any other Federal, foreign or Blue Sky or related laws relating to the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Other
Filings"). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that the
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will be registered or qualified
under the securities law of every jurisdiction in the United States in which any
registered holder of Company Common Stock has an address of record on the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the
Company Stockholders' Meeting; provided that Parent shall not be required to
consent generally to the service of process in any jurisdiction in which it is
not so subject. Each of Company and Parent will notify the other promptly upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government
officials of the receipt of notice that the S-4 has become effective, of the
issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government
officials for amendments or supplements to the S-4, the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any Other Filing or for additional information and,
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Legal
Requirement, will supply the other with copies of all correspondence between
such party or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the
S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Merger or any Other Filing. Each
of Company and Parent will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing
with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under this Section 5.2(a) to comply
in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder.

          (b) The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall (i) solicit the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger and include the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of Company to Company's stockholders that they vote in favor
of approval of this Agreement and the Merger, subject to the right of the Board
of Directors of Company to withdraw its recommendation and recommend a Superior
Offer in compliance with Section 5.2(c) of this Agreement, and (ii) include

                                     -41-
<PAGE>

the opinion of Merrill Lynch & Co. referred to in Section 2.19; provided,
however, that the Board of Directors of Company shall submit this Agreement to
Company's stockholders whether or not at any time subsequent to the date hereof
such board determines that it can no longer make such recommendation. The Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall (A) solicit the approval of the Share Issuance
and include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent to Parent's
stockholders that they vote in favor of approval of the Share Issuance, and (B)
include the opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated referred to in Section
3.12. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors
of Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act.

          (c) Each of Parent and Company shall promptly inform the other of any
event which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the S-4 or any Other Filing and each of Parent
and Company shall amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
the extent required by law to do so. No amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the S-4 shall be made without the approval of
Parent and Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Each of the parties hereto shall advise the other parties hereto,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the S-4 has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any
stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction,
or of any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information.

          --------------------

          (a) Company shall call and hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting and
Parent shall call and hold the Parent Stockholders' Meeting as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof for the purpose of voting upon the approval of
this Agreement and the Merger or the Share Issuance, as the case may be,
pursuant to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Company and Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting
and the Parent Stockholders' Meeting on the same day and as soon as practicable
after the date on which the S-4 becomes effective. Nothing herein shall prevent
Company or Parent from adjourning or postponing the Company Stockholders'
Meeting or the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, as the case may be, if there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case
may be, necessary to conduct business at their respective meetings of the
stockholders. Unless Company's Board of Directors has withdrawn its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in compliance with Section
5.2(c), Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger
pursuant to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of stockholders required by
Delaware Law or applicable stock exchange requirements to obtain such approval.
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the Share Issuance pursuant to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or

                                     -42-
<PAGE>

consent of stockholders required by Delaware Law or applicable stock exchange
requirements to obtain such approval. Unless Company's Board of Directors has
withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in compliance with
Section 5.2(c), each of the parties hereto shall take all other action
reasonably necessary or advisable to promptly and expeditiously secure any vote
or consent of stockholders required by applicable Law and such party's
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to effect the Merger. Company's
obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders'
Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited to or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
to Company of any Acquisition Proposal or any change in the Board of Directors
recommendation regarding the Merger.

     (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c): (i) the Board of Directors of Company shall
recommend that Company's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve
this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders' Meeting; (ii) the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect that
the Board of Directors of Company has recommended that Company's stockholders
vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger at the
Company Stockholders' Meeting; and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of
Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or
resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Company that Company's stockholders
vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger.

     (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of
Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation
in favor of adopting and approving this Agreement and the Merger or from not
including its recommendation in favor of adopting and approving this Agreement
and the Merger in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus if (i) a Superior Offer
(as defined below) is made to Company and not withdrawn, (ii) neither Company
nor any of its representatives shall have violated any of the restrictions set
forth in Section 5.4 and Company is not then in breach of this Agreement, and
(iii) the Board of Directors  of Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with and receiving advice from its outside counsel, that, in light
of such Superior Offer, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification
of such recommendation is necessary in order for the Board of Directors of
Company to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Company's stockholders under
applicable law; provided, however, that prior to any commencement thereof
                --------  -------
Company shall have given Parent at least forty eight (48) hours notice thereof
and the opportunity to meet with Company and its counsel. Nothing contained in
this Section 5.2 shall limit Company's obligation to hold and convene the
Company Stockholders' Meeting (regardless of whether the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of Company shall have been withdrawn, amended or modified).
For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona
fide written offer made by a third party to consummate any of the following
transactions: (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Company pursuant to which the stockholders of Company immediately preceding such
transaction hold less than 51% of the equity interest in the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction; (ii) a sale or other disposition by
Company of assets



                                     -43-

(excluding inventory and used equipment sold in the ordinary course of business)
representing in excess of 51% of the fair market value of Company's business
immediately prior to such sale, or (iii) the acquisition by any person or group
(including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by
Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire
beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 51% of the voting power
of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of Company, in each case on
terms that the Board of Directors of Company determines, in its reasonable
judgment (based on written advice of a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be more favorable to Company stockholders from a
financial point of view than the terms of the Merger; provided, however, that
                                                      --------  -------
any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Offer" if any financing
required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer is not
committed and is not likely in the judgment of Company's Board of Directors to
be obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

     5.3  Confidentiality; Access to Information.

may reasonably request; provided, that Parent will conduct any such review in a
                        --------
manner that does not interfere with the normal business operations of Company.
No information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 5.3 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger.  Parent will afford Company and its accountants, counsel
and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books, records and personnel of Parent
during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information

properties, results of operations and personnel of Parent, as Company may
reasonably request; provided, that Company will conduct any such review in a
                    --------
manner that does not interfere with the normal business operations of Parent.

     5.4  No Solicitation.
          ---------------

     (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Company and its
subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their respective
officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment banker, attorney
or other advisor or representative retained by any of them to, directly or

any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) subject to Section

--------  -------
of Directors from (A) furnishing information regarding Company and its
subsidiaries to, entering into a confidentiality agreement with or entering into
discussions with, any person or group in response to a Superior Offer submitted
by such person or group (and not withdrawn), (B) taking the actions described in
Section 5.2(c) as permitted thereby, (C) recommending a Superior Offer to

person or group and (y) Company receives from such person or group an executed
confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and

by or on behalf of Company, and (4) contemporaneously with furnishing any such
information to such person or group, Company furnishes such information to
Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished by
Company to Parent).  Nothing in this Section 5.4(a) shall prevent Company or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal with respect to which no violation of
this Section 5.4 shall have occurred.  Company and its subsidiaries will
immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding two sentences by any officer or director

prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the members of
Company's Board of Directors) of any meeting of Company's Board of Directors at

to such release or public statement. The parties have agreed to the text of the
joint press release announcing the signing of this Agreement.

complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, where the
conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would not be satisfied
as a result thereof; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect

notification shall affect the

<PAGE>

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

          (a) Stock Options.  At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
              -------------
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") under
the Company Option Plans, whether or not vested, shall be assumed by Parent.
Each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such
Company Stock Options immediately prior to the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, any repurchase rights or vesting provisions and provisions
regarding the acceleration of vesting on certain transactions, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), except that (i) each Company Stock
Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its
terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent.  Parent shall comply with the terms of all
such Company Stock Options and use its best efforts to ensure, to the extent
required by and subject to the provisions of, the Company Option Plans, and to
the extent permitted under the Code, that any Company Stock Options that
qualified for tax treatment as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the
Code prior to the Effective Time continue to so qualify after the Effective
Time.  Parent shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of assumed Company Stock Options on the terms set forth in this Section 5.8 (a).

          (b) ESPP. As of the Effective Time, the ESPP shall be terminated.  The
              ----

underway under the ESPP shall be determined by treating the last business day

making such other pro rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period
as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
ESPP.  Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take all commercially
reasonable actions (including but not limited to, if appropriate, amending the
ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transaction contemplated by this
Section

<PAGE>

5.8(b). As of the Effective Time, participants in the ESPP ("ESPP Participants")
shall become participants in Parent's Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("Parent

shall begin as of the Effective Time and continue through January 31, 2000. As
of February 1, 2000, ESPP Participants will proceed with participation in
Parent's ESPP according to the provisions of the Parent ESPP. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall take commercially reasonable efforts (including,
but not limited to, if required, amending the Parent ESPP) that are necessary to
give effect to the transaction contemplated by this Section 5.8(b).

          (c) 401(k).  Company shall terminate, effective as of the day
              ------
immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all 401(k) plans sponsored or
maintained by Company unless Parent provides written notice to Company prior to
the Effective Time that any such 401(k) plan shall not be terminated.  Parent
shall receive from Company evidence that Company's plan(s) and / or program(s)
have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of Company's Board of Directors
(the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent), effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective
Time.  Company employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan
sponsored by Parent as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective
Time.

          (d) Benefits; Prior Service.  From and after the Effective Time,
              -----------------------

those provided to employees of Parent who are similarly situated. Parent shall
cause employees of Company and its subsidiaries to be credited with service with
Company and each of its subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
accrual  of vacation days, personal days and sick leave under each employee
benefit plan maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time.  Parent shall have the absolute discretion to (i) cash-out Company
employees accrued and unused vacation, personal and sick leave days or to (ii)
carry over Company employees' accrued but unused vacation, personal and sick
leave days; provided, that, such service shall not be recognized to the extent
            --------  ----
that such recognition would result in duplication of benefits.

          --------
for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company
Stock Options as soon as is reasonably practicable, and in any event within

Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company (or
any predecessor corporation) pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement
between Company and its directors or officers in effect immediately prior to the

provision under the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof.

to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Company Charter Documents
as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified
Party or of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were
employees or agents of Company, unless such modification is required by law.

          (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to maintain in
effect policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance with coverage in
amount and scope at least as favorable as Company's existing policies with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the

                --------  -------
Corporation shall in no event be required to expend pursuant to this Section
5.10(b) more than an amount per year equal to 150% of current premiums paid by
Company for such insurance, which current premium amount is set forth in Section

person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers a material amount of its
properties and assets to any person in a single transaction or a series of
transactions, then, and in each such case, Parent will make or cause to be made
proper provision so that the successors and assigns of Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, assume the indemnification obligations
described herein for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties.

          (d) The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall survive the Effective
Time and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,

(or to cause the Surviving Company or any Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub not
to fail to take any action), which if taken or not taken, as the case may be,
would reasonably be expected to prevent, the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails to pay in a timely manner the
amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3(b) and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment against Company for the
amounts set forth in this Section 7.3(b), Company shall pay to Parent its

expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts
