 _WHEREAS_ , the respective Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (a) determined that the Offer and the Merger (both as defined herein) and the other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (b) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and (c) to the extent required by applicable law, recommended that the Companys shareholders adopt this Agreement;

     1.  |   | THE OFFER  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) Provided that (i) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section 10 and (ii) none of the events set forth in _Annex I_ hereto shall have occurred or be existing, Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event not later than eight (8) Business Days after the date of this Agreement), commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer for all of the Shares, at the Offer Price, without interest. 

  

 (b) The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to accept and pay for Shares tendered shall be subject only to (i) the condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer prior to the expiration date of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of Shares (including the Shares tendered under the Shareholder Agreements) which, together with the Shares then owned by Parent and Merger Sub, represents at least ninety percent (90%) of the total number of Fully Diluted Shares (as defined below) (the " _Minimum Condition_ "), subject to such waivers of, and changes to, the Minimum Condition as may be required pursuant to Section 1.1(e), and (ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ hereto (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Fully Diluted Shares_ " shall mean the total number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, assuming (A) exercise on a cash basis of all outstanding Company Options, whether vested or unvested (excluding for this purpose all Company Options, whether vested or unvested, held by holders who have entered into binding written agreements with the Company agreeing to refrain from exercising all or any portion of such Company Options during any period that the Offer remains pending _and_ all Company Options with an exercise price greater than the Offer Price, irrespective of whether the holders thereof have entered into such binding written agreements), and (B) exercise or conversion of all other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or securities convertible into Company Common Stock and issuance of all shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is obligated to issue. 

  

 (c) Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any of the Offer Conditions and to make any change in the terms or conditions of the Offer; _provided_ that, without the prior written consent of the Company, no change may be made which (i) changes the form or amount of consideration to be paid (other than by adding consideration) or changes the number of Shares sought in the Offer, (ii) imposes any conditions to the Offer other than the Offer Conditions or modifies the Offer Conditions (other than to waive any Offer Condition to the extent permitted by this Agreement), (iii) changes or waives the Minimum Condition, except as required pursuant to Section 1.1(e), (iv) extends the Offer beyond the initial expiration date of the Offer (except as permitted or required by Section 1.1(d)), or (v) makes any other change to the terms of the Offer which is adverse to the holders of Shares. 

  

 (d) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement, satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (subject to such waivers of, and changes to, the Minimum Condition as may be required pursuant to Section 1.1(e)) and the absence (or waiver to the extent permitted by this Agreement) of the other Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the

   ##### 

  

    

Offer as soon as it is permitted to do so under applicable law and shall pay
for all such Shares promptly after acceptance. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at 12:00 midnight Central time on the date that is the
20th Business Day after the commencement date of the Offer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the
parties termination rights under Section 10.1, (i) if, immediately prior to
the initial expiration of the Offer, the number of Shares validly tendered in
accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn is at least seventy
percent (70%) of the Fully Diluted Shares but less than the Minimum
Condition, Merger Sub shall have a one time right to extend the expiration
date of the Offer, without the consent of the Company, for an additional
period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days; (ii) if, immediately prior to the
initial expiration of the Offer, the number of Shares validly tendered in
accordance with the terms of the Offer is either (A) greater than thirty five
percent (35%) of the Fully Diluted Shares but less than forty nine and nine-
tenths percent (49.9%) of the Fully Diluted Shares or (B) greater
than seventy percent (70%) of the Fully Diluted Shares but less than the
Minimum Condition, the Company shall have the right to require Merger Sub to
extend the expiration date of the Offer for an additional period not to
exceed ten (10) Business Days; (iii) if, immediately prior to the
initial expiration of the Offer or the expiration of any extension thereof
permitted or required pursuant to this Section 1.1(d), an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal has been made and remains pending, Merger Sub shall have
a one time right to extend, and the Company shall, so long as it has
not breached in any material respect its obligations under Section 8.8, have
a one time right to require Merger Sub to extend, the expiration date of the
Offer for an additional period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days; (iv) if,
immediately prior to the initial expiration date of the Offer or any
extension thereof permitted or required by this Section 1.1(d), the Minimum
Condition, the Option Exercise Minimum Condition or the Revised Minimum
Condition, as applicable, has been satisfied but any of the other Offer
Conditions exists and has not been waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, take all action necessary to extend the expiration date
of the Offer until the earlier of the removal or waiver of all of such other
Offer Conditions or the termination of this Agreement; and (v) without the
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall have the right, subject to its
compliance with the terms of this Agreement, to extend the expiration date of
the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the Securities Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") applicable to
the Offer. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, the expiration date
of the Offer shall not be extended without the prior written consent of the
Company. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if, at the end of the initial expiration of the Offer or any extension thereof permitted or required pursuant to Section 1.1(d), the Minimum Condition is not satisfied but the number of Shares then tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn is equal to or greater than forty nine and nine-tenths percent (49.9%) of the Fully Diluted Shares, then, at the request of the Company and subject to any right of Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to: (i) exercise the Top-Up Stock Option (as defined below), waive the Minimum Condition, and, in contemplation of the exercise of the Top-Up Stock Option, reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer to that percentage of the Fully Diluted Shares (the " _Option Exercise Minimum Condition_ ") that, when combined with the number of shares issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Stock Option, equals ninety percent (90%) of the Fully Diluted Shares; or (ii) waive the Minimum Condition and amend the Offer to reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer to 49.9% of the Fully Diluted 

   ##### 

  

    

Shares (the " _Revised Minimum Condition_ ") and, subject to the prior
satisfaction or waiver of the other Offer Conditions, purchase, on a pro rata
basis, the number of Shares comprising the Revised Minimum Condition
(it being understood that the Companys right to require Merger Sub to take
the actions described in clause (ii) is triggered if and only if the exercise
of the Top-Up Stock Option would not, when combined with the number of Shares
then tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn, result in Merger Sub
holding ninety percent (90%) of the Fully Diluted Shares; it being further
understood that Merger Sub shall not in any event be required to accept for
payment, or pay for, any Shares if the number of Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer and not withdrawn at the expiration date is less than the Revised
Minimum Condition). 

  

 (f) As soon as practicable on or prior to the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer which will contain or incorporate by reference all or part of the form of the related letter of transmittal (together with any supplements or amendments thereto, collectively the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC. 

  

 1.2 _Company Action_. 

  

 (a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer and represents that its Board of Directors (the " _Company Board_ "), at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and are in the best interest of the Companys shareholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and the Shareholder Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereby, such that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are not and shall not be subject to any state takeover statutes, and (iii) resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and, to the extent required by applicable law, approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Companys shareholders (the recommendations referred to in this clause (iii) are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the " _Company Recommendation_ "). The Company further represents that Goldman Sachs and Co. has rendered to the Company Board its opinion that the $31.00 in cash to be received by the holders of Shares in the Offer and the Merger is fair from a financial point of view to such holders. The Company has been advised that all of its directors and executive officers presently intend to tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer pursuant to the Shareholder Agreements. The Company will promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with a list of its shareholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case as of the most 

   #####

terms for the purpose of contacting all record holders of Shares regarding
the Offer and provide to Parent and Merger Sub such additional information
(including, without limitation, updated lists of shareholders, mailing labels
and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent or
Merger Sub may reasonably request in connection with the Offer. 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable on the day that the Offer is commenced, the Company will file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (the " _Schedule 14D-9_") which shall reflect the Company Recommendation. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC. 

  

 1.3 _Directors_. 

  

 (a) Effective upon consummation of the Offer, Parent shall, subject to Section 1.3(c), be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub (including Shares accepted for payment in connection with the Offer) bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding, and the Company shall take all action necessary to cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including increasing the number of directors, or seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors, or both; provided that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall always have at least two (2) Continuing Directors (as defined below). If the number of Continuing Directors is reduced to less than two (2) for any reason prior to the Effective Time, the remaining and departing Continuing Directors shall be entitled to designate a person to fill the vacancy. At such times, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Company Board of (x) each committee of the Company Board, (y) each board of directors of each subsidiary and (z) each committee of each such board. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that Parents designees are elected to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time, the unanimous affirmative vote of the Continuing Directors shall be required for the Company to (a) amend or terminate this Agreement or agree or consent to any amendment or termination of this Agreement, (b) waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, (c) extend the time for performance of Parents and Merger Subs respective obligations hereunder, or (d) approve any other action by the Company which is reasonably likely to adversely affect the interests of the shareholders of the Company (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)), with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, in the event approval of

Directors_ " shall mean members of the Company Board who were directors of
the Company prior to the consummation of the Offer. 

  

 (b) The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3. Parent will supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

  

 (c) Parent agrees that it will not exercise its right to designate members of the Company Board pursuant to this Section 1.3 in any manner that would result in the Company becoming non-compliant with the corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq National Market applicable to listed companies, including Rule 4350 thereof.

No offering periods or purchase periods under the ESPP that are subsequent to the current purchase period in process as of the date of this Agreement shall be commenced, and the ESPP and all purchase rights thereunder shall terminate effective as of the Effective Time. The Company Board or compensation committee of the Company Board shall take all necessary action to provide that participants under the ESPP may not increase their payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement.

be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The
Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of
the holders of shares Company Common Stock and Company Options and
(ii) applied promptly to making the payments provided for in Section 3\. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly
provided for in this Agreement. 

  

 4.2 _Exchange of Shares_. 

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the amount of the Merger Consideration that such former holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 3, in each case, in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 

  

 (b) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to any Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent in advance any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to any Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. As used herein, " _Person_ " means an individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, business trust, joint stock company, trust, unincorporated association, joint venture or other entity of whatever nature. 

  

 (c) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Paying Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 4. 

  

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the Companys shareholders for one year after the Effective Time shall 

   ##### 

  

    

be paid, at the request of Parent, to Parent. Any shareholder of the Company
who has not theretofore complied with this Section 4 shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock held by such shareholder at the Effective
Time as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
none of Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, Merger Sub or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (f) Parent or the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, or any affiliate (as defined under the Exchange Act (an " _Affiliate_ ")) thereof, or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Parent or the Paying Agent. 

  

 4.3 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the other provisions of the Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Offer or the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had

represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows: 

  

 5.1 _Corporate Organization_. 

  

 (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of California. The Company has the corporate power and corporate authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business currently conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change or effect that is (i) materially adverse to the business, operations, assets, properties, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) prevents the Company from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis; _provided, however,_ that in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred, there shall be excluded any effect on the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to or arising in connection with (A) the negotiation (including activities relating to due diligence), execution, delivery or public announcement or the pendency of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any actions required to be taken in compliance herewith (exclusive, however, of the actions required to be taken by Section 7.1 hereof) or otherwise with the consent of the other party hereto, including the impact thereof on the relationships of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers, distributors, consultants, employees or independent contractors or other third parties with whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any relationship and including any litigation brought by any shareholder of the Company solely as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) any event, occurrence, circumstance or trend, including a diminution in value, related to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, properties, assets, results of operations or financial condition that, to the Knowledge of Parent, exists as of the date hereof, (C) any fact, circumstance or condition disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent such change, effect or circumstance is specifically set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or is reasonably apparent from the face of the Company Disclosure Schedule without additional information, (D) any change in the market price or trading volume of the Companys securities, in and of itself, (E) any failure, in and of itself, by the Company to meet any projections or forecasts for any period ending (or for which revenues or earnings are released) on or after the date hereof, (F) any change in federal, state, non-U.S. or local law, regulations, policies or procedures, or interpretations thereof, generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or regulatory accounting requirements applicable or potentially applicable to the industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate, (G) changes generally affecting the industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate, (H) changes in economic conditions (including changes in the prevailing interest rates) in the United States, in any region thereof, or in any non-U.S. or global economy or (I) any attack on, 

   #####

the United States, or any declaration of war by the United States Congress or
any hurricane or other natural disaster; _provided, however_ , that
the changes referred to in clauses (F) through (I) do not have a materially
disproportionate effect (relative to other industry participants) on the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As used herein, "
_Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any Person, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or any other entity
that is consolidated with such Person for financial reporting purposes.

 (d) The minute books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries previously made available to Parent contain true, complete and correct records in all material respects of all meetings and other material corporate actions held or taken since January 1, 2004 of their respective shareholders, members, partners or other equity holders and Boards of Directors or other governing bodies (including committees of their respective Boards of Directors or other governing bodies) through the date hereof.

As of the close of business on the Capitalization Date, no shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock were reserved or to be made available for issuance, except as set forth in Section 5.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of
any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or any other
equity securities of the Company or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of the Company capital stock
(including any rights plan or agreement). Section 5.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct list of

convertible into or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock, other

date and disclosed in this Section 5.2(a) or pursuant to the surrender of
shares to the Company or the withholding of shares by the Company to cover
tax withholding obligations under the Company Stock Plans, or (ii) issued or

Except as set forth in Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of or all other equity interests in each of the Companys Subsidiaries free and clear of any liens, charges, encumbrances, adverse rights or claims and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such shares are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase, sale or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of any Subsidiary of the Company or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of any such Subsidiary.

delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution

obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by general principles of
equity whether applied in a court of law or a court of equity and

The Company has filed all forms, reports, statements, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2004 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Reports_ ").

None of the Company SEC Reports contained, when filed or, if amended or supplemented prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment or supplement, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company has furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications which have not yet been filed with the SEC but which are required to be filed, to reports, agreements, documents or other instruments which previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any material agreements potentially required to be filed that have not been so filed.

6\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB 

   

 Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows: 

  

 6.1 _Corporate Organization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation.

The copies of the charter documents of Parent and Merger Sub which have previously been made available to the Company are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a timely manner or otherwise prevent or materially delay Parent or Merger Sub from performing any of its material obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 6.2 _Authority; No Violation_. 

  

 (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), nor compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of charter documents of Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Section 6.3 are duly obtained or made, (A) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, or (B) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit under, or require redemption or repurchase or otherwise require the purchase or sale of any securities, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except (in the case of clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults or other events which either individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 6.3 _Consents and Approvals_. No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, any Governmental Entity or any third Person are necessary in connection with (a) the execution and delivery by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement or (b) the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Offer or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) any notices required to be filed under the HSR Act, (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger and related certificates with the California Secretary pursuant to the CGCL, (iii) any notices or filing requirements under the Exchange Act and (iv) consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations with, Governmental Entities or third parties the failure of which to be obtained would not be reasonably expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 6.4 _Broker s Fees_. Except as set forth in Schedule 6.4, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Subsidiaries has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 6.5 _Legal Proceedings_. 

  

 (a) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, material legal, administrative, arbitral or other material proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature challenging the validity or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As used herein, " _to the Knowledge of Parent_ " means the actual knowledge of the officers of the Parent listed in Schedule 6.5(a), in each case without such individual being obligated to conduct any special inquiry or investigation into the affairs or records of the Company. The officers of the Parent listed in 

     ##### 

  

    

Schedule 6.5(a) shall not be deemed to have knowledge (actual, constructive
or otherwise) of any fact, event, condition or occurrence known or deemed to
be known by any other person other than as expressly set forth in
the foregoing sentence. 

   

 (b) There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory restriction of any Governmental Entity specifically imposed upon Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the assets of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries which has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

   

 6.6 _Financial Capability_. Parent, through its wholly owned subsidiary American Medical Systems, Inc. (" _AMS_ "), will have available at the consummation of the Offer sufficient immediately available funds through cash on hand or binding credit facility commitments from reputable lenders and financial institutions for borrowings of up to $745,000,000 in funds (the " _Commitments_ "), true and complete copies of which have been furnished to the Company, to enable Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement, to consummate the Offer and the Merger and to pay in full all fees and expenses payable by Parent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of AMS and, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, the other parties thereto. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of AMS, Parent or Merger Sub under any term or condition of the Commitments. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that AMS, Parent and Merger Sub will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Commitments. AMS, Parent or Merger Sub will pay in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitments prior to the end of the first Business Day following the date of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parents ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby is not contingent on Parents ability to complete any public offering or private placement of equity or debt securities or to obtain any other type of financing prior to consummating the Offer and the Merger. 

  

 6.7 _Parent Information_. Neither the Offer Documents nor any of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or its Subsidiaries or representatives for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 or the Proxy Statement will, at the respective times any such documents or any amendments or supplements thereto are filed with the SEC, are first published, sent or given to shareholders or become effective under the Securities Act or, in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The Offer Documents will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of all applicable laws, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations thereunder. No representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. 

  

 6.8 _No Business Activities by Merger Sub_. All of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is owned by AMS and all of the outstanding 

   ##### 

  

 

capital stock of AMS is owned by Parent. Merger Sub is not a party to any
contract and has not conducted any activities other than in connection with
the organization of Merger Sub, the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Merger Sub has no Subsidiaries. 

   

 6.9 _Ownership of Company Common Stock; No Other Agreements_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their respective Affiliates or associates (as such term is defined under the Exchange Act) (a) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or (b) is a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in case of either clause (a) or (b), any Company Common Stock, in each case, except in accordance with this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger.

 (a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) give those employees who are, as of the Effective Time, employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Company (collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ ") for such Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor entity) to the same extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees under any Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time; (iii) provide credit under any such welfare plan for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the coverage period during which any transfer of coverage occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service shall be recognized to the extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits; and (iv) honor in accordance with their terms all employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time but no later than December 31, 2006, and subject to the immediately following sentence, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to the Continuing Employees 

     ##### 

  

    

compensation and benefit arrangements that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation and benefit arrangements that are provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to, cause the Continuing Employees to commence participation in
such Parent Plans as are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall
keep in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions of,
any agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between or among the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its or their employees
relating to severance pay or similar benefits. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this Section 8.6 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of doubt any Continuing Employees, present or former employees or directors, consultants or independent contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 8.6) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 8.6 or elsewhere in the Agreement shall be construed to prevent, from and after the Effective Time, the termination of employment of any individual Continuing Employee or, subject to the provisions of Section 8.6(a), any change in the employee benefits available to any Continuing Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular Plan in accordance with its terms. 

   

 (d) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all requisite action necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan, including notifying the participants that the 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan has been terminated; provided, that immediately following the Effective Time all Continuing Employees are permitted to participate in Parents 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan. 

   

 8.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Company shall jointly and severally: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who served as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by California law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim (as defined below) and any judgments, fines (including excise taxes), penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by California law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses (as defined below) incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the 

      ##### 

  

    

requirement of any bond or other security, but in the case of advancement of
Expenses upon receipt of an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable
law, from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced Expenses if it is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final order that such
Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect
to such Expenses. In the event any Claim is brought against any Indemnified
Party, Parent and the Surviving Company shall each use all commercially
reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of such matter, provided
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder) without
the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party if and to the extent the
claimant seeks any non-monetary relief from such Indemnified Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company pursuant to this
Section 8.7(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the
Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any Claim
relating thereto) and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to an individual who has ceased to be a
director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time and shall inure to the benefit of such individuals heirs, executors and
personal and legal representatives. In connection with any determination as
to whether the Indemnified Parties are entitled to the benefits of this
Section 8.7(a), the burden of proof shall be on Parent and the Surviving
Company to establish that an Indemnified Party is not so entitled. As used in
this Section 8.7(a), (A) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry
or investigation, whether instituted by the Company, any Governmental Entity
or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might
lead to the institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including
any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising
out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys
duties or service as a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or
fiduciary of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any employee benefit
plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective Time and
any other Person at the request the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and
(B) the term " _Expenses_ " means attorneys fees and all other costs,
expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses,
court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding
costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or
incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification
is authorized pursuant to this Section 8.7(a), including any action relating
to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified
Party. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall keep in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions of, any agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party providing for the indemnification of such Indemnified Party. 

   

 (c) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this Section 8.7, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Companys Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws or 

     ##### 

 

    

in the corresponding constituent documents of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to
matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter, without any amendment
thereto. 

   

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company, as the case may be (including Parents ultimate parent entity, if applicable), assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company set forth in this Section 8.7. 

   

 (e) As of the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Company or the Company (with the election being at Parents option) shall have purchased and shall maintain in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date (or, if any Claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, Parent shall ensure that such insurance remains in effect until final disposition of such Claim) a directors and officers liability insurance policy or policies providing each individual currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions relating to the approval of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are in the aggregate no less advantageous to such directors and officers of the Company than the terms and conditions of the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of the Company from reputable carriers having a rating comparable to the Companys current carrier. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this Section 8.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent or the Surviving Company under this Section 8.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under this Section 8.7 without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Company under this Section 8.7. 

   

 8.8 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, and shall cause their respective officers, directors, representatives and agents (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) (collectively, " _Company Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease any existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and will use its best efforts to cause all Persons other than Parent who have been furnished with confidential 

    ##### 

  

    

information regarding the Company in connection with the solicitation of or
discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to
the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. The Company
agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party
from the confidentiality and stand still provisions of any agreement to which
the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or becomes a party, and
will immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may
have heretofore been given under any such provisions authorizing any Person
to make an Acquisition Proposal, unless the Company Board reasonably
determines in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably
likely to be, a Superior Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall not
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Representative to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish or disclose to any Third Party non-public
information with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) negotiate
or engage in substantive discussions with any Third Party with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) enter into any agreement (whether or not
binding) or agreement in principle with respect to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that at any time prior to the consummation of the
Offer, in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not
solicited by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Company Representative and
which the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consulting
with its financial advisors and legal counsel, constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to constitute, a Superior Proposal, the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (and its officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and
other representatives) and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with, and provided draft documents and agreements to, the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and its officers, directors, employees, accountants,
consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives)
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if (prior to furnishing such information
to, or entering into such discussions or negotiations with, such Person) the
Company (A) provides reasonable notice to Parent to the effect that it is
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such Person, (B) provides Parent with all information to be provided to such
Person which Parent has not previously been provided, and (C) receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement reasonably satisfactory to
the Company Board with terms, as a whole, that are no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (b) Except as set forth in this Section 8.8(b), the Company Board shall not (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement (whether or not binding) or agreement in principle with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 8.8(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to consummation of the Offer, in response to the receipt of an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if the Company Board (A) reasonably determines in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (B) determines in good faith after consultation with its legal counsel that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable law, then the Company Board may approve and recommend such Superior Proposal and, in connection with such approval and recommendation, withdraw, or modify or change in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation (either, a " _Company Recommendation Change_ "); 

    ##### 

  

    

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Recommendation Change shall be valid
or effective until (i) the Company has provided written notice to Parent
advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying in writing all of the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal and,
(ii) Parent does not make, within three (3) Business Days after receipt of
such notice from the Company, an offer that the Company Board reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, is at least as favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock
as the Superior Proposal and during such three (3) Business Day period the
Company reasonably considers and discusses in good faith all proposals
submitted by Parent and, without limiting the foregoing, causes its financial
advisors and legal advisors as requested by Parent to reasonably consider and
discuss with Parent and its representatives such proposals in good faith. In
the event that the Company enters into a definitive agreement with a Third
Party with respect to a Superior Proposal and in connection therewith this
Agreement is terminated, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the standstill provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall be
entitled to present an Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board (it being
understood that except as modified hereby such standstill provisions shall
remain in full force and effect). 

   

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith that such disclosure is required by applicable law. 

   

 (d) As used in this Agreement: 

   

 (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer relating to (i) the acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock or any other voting securities of the Company by any Third Party, (ii) a merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization, share exchange, sale of assets, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction which would result in any Third Party acquiring 20% or more of the fair market value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including capital stock of Subsidiaries of the Company), (iii) any other transaction which would result in a Third Party acquiring 20% or more of the fair market value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including capital stock of Subsidiaries of the Company), immediately prior to such transaction (whether by purchase of assets, acquisition of stock of a Subsidiary or otherwise), (iv) any combination of the foregoing or (v) any other transaction that is conditioned or predicated on the Merger not being completed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to result in the Merger not being so completed. 

  

 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal (with all of the percentages included in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to 75%) the terms of which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel), taking into account, among other things, the legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, whether the acquiring party is capable of consummating the Acquisition Proposal on the terms 

   ##### 

  

 

proposed, and whether the Acquisition Proposal is subject to any financing
contingency, would, if consummated, be more favorable from a financial point
of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than those set forth in
this Agreement. 

   

 8.9 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take all such steps as may be required and permitted to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such Company Common Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 8.10 _InnovaQuartz Stock Purchase Agreement_. Parent hereby agrees and acknowledges that following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall assume (i) any and all of the Companys payments obligations specified in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of April 30, 2006 by and between the Company, InnovaQuartz Incorporated, an Arizona corporation (" _InnovaQuartz_ "), and the stockholders of InnovaQuartz (the " _InnovaQuartz Stock Purchase Agreement_ "), and (ii) any and all of the Companys operational covenants specified in Section 6.10 of the InnovaQuartz Stock Purchase Agreement. 

  

 8.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Parent, and the Parent will give prompt written notice to the Company, of any material failure of the Company or Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.11 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice; _provided_ , _further_ , the failure to deliver any such notice shall not be considered in determining whether the condition set forth in paragraph (c) of _Annex I_ exists. 

  

9\. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT 

   

 _Conditions to Each Party s Obligation to Effect the Merger_. The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions: 

  

 (a) _Shareholder Approval_. If required by applicable law, the Agreement of Merger shall have been approved by the Company Required Vote. 

   

 (b) _HSR Compliance_. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated. 

   

 (c) _No Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality_. No order, injunction, statute, rule, regulation or decree shall have been issued, enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a Governmental Entity that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger.

    ##### 

  

    

Condition or the Revised Minimum Condition, provided that no party shall be
entitled to invoke this condition if, in breach of its obligations under this
Agreement, it shall have been the cause of the failure of Merger Sub to
purchase pursuant to the Offer, the Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn. 

   

10\. TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT 

   

 10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the terminating party or parties, notwithstanding any requisite approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, and whether before or after the shareholders of the Company have approved this Agreement at the Company Shareholder Meeting, as follows (the date of any such termination, the " _Termination Date_ "): 

  

 (a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines; 

   

 (b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order which has the effect of making consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger; 

   

 (c) by either Parent or the Company if the Offer has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2006; _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(c) shall not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement materially contributed to the failure of the Offer to be consummated on or before such date; 

   

 (d) by either Parent or the Company if the Offer terminates or expires in accordance with its terms, after giving effect to the rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Section 1.1(d) and Section 1.1(e), without Merger Sub having accepted for payment any Shares pursuant to the Offer due to its failure to achieve the Revised Minimum Condition, except that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(d) will not be available to any party whose failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement has been the proximate cause of, or resulted in, such failure to achieve the Revised Minimum Condition; 

   

 (e) by Parent if it is not in material breach of this Agreement and if (i) there has been a breach on the part of the Company of any of its covenants or agreements herein such that the condition set forth in paragraph (b) of _Annex I_ exists or (ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company herein are or become untrue or incorrect such that the condition set forth in paragraph (c) of _Annex I_ exists (in each case, after giving effect to the cure periods specified therein); 

   

 (f) by the Company if it is not in material breach of this Agreement, and if (i) the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in Section 6.6 are or become untrue or inaccurate or (ii) any of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub herein, other 

  ##### 

  

    

than those set forth in Section 6.6, are or become untrue or inaccurate, or
(iii) there has  been a breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub of any of
their respective covenants or agreements herein, and, in the case of clause
(ii) and (iii) only, (A) such breach has not been, or cannot be, cured in all
material respects within thirty (30) Business Days after written notice to
Parent and Merger Sub, or (B) without regard to any qualification or reference
to materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect set forth in such
representations and warranties, such inaccuracy or breach would, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; 

   

 (g) by Parent (i) if the Company breaches in any material respect any of its obligations under Section 8.8, (ii) if the Company Board shall have effected a Company Recommendation Change, or (iii) the Company shall have failed to include in the Proxy Statement distributed to the Companys shareholders, if any, its recommendation that shareholders approve this Agreement and the Merger; 

   

 (h) by the Company (i) if the Company Board shall have effected a Company Recommendation Change prior to the consummation of the Offer and the Company is not concurrently in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and has materially complied with its obligations under Section 8.8, or (ii) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have failed to commence the Offer in accordance with Section 1.1(a); _provided_ , _however_ , the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(h)(ii) if such failure to have commenced the Offer shall have been caused by the Companys failure to perform in all material respects its obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. 

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that (i) Section 8.2(b), the last sentence of Section 8.8(b), Section 10.2 and Section 11 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that receipt of the Termination Fee (as defined below) as provided herein shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable by the Company. 

   

 (b) The Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of $25,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated as follows: 

   

 (i) if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 10.1(g) or 10.1(h)(i), then (so long as neither Parent nor Merger Sub was in material breach of this Agreement) the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent on the second Business Day after the date of 

   ##### 

  

  

 termination; or (ii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Sections 10.1(c), 10.1(d) or 10.1(e), (B) in the case of a termination pursuant to Sections 10.1(c) and 10.1(d) only, prior to the Termination Date there shall have been an Acquisition Proposal, and (C) within twelve (12) months of the Termination Date, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with a Third Party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal is consummated by such Third Party, then (so long as neither Parent nor Merger Sub was not in material breach of this Agreement) the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid to, Parent the Termination Fee upon consummation of such Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (c) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to Section 10.2(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 

   

 (d) The Company and Parent agree that the agreements contained in Section 10.2(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreements Parent would not have entered into this Agreement, and that the amount of the Termination Fee does not constitute a penalty. 

   

 10.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company Required Vote, there may not be any amendment of this Agreement which, by applicable law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval of the Companys shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

 10.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after receipt of the Company Required Vote, there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement which decreases the Merger consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Companys shareholders hereunder without the approval of such shareholders. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 

  

11\. GENERAL PROVISIONS 

   

 11.1 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, except for those

covenants and agreements contained herein and therein which by their terms
apply in whole or in part after the Effective Time.
