WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (upon the unanimous

ARTICLE I.

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the
Company, as the surviving entity in the Merger (the "Surviving Company"),
shall, by virtue of the Merger, continue its existence under the laws of the
State of Delaware.

  

  

Section 1.2. Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the third
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of
the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII (excluding conditions
that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject
to the satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of those conditions as of the
Closing), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto (the actual date of the Closing, the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall
be held at the offices of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue,
New York, New York 10019, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.

  

  

Section 1.3. Effective Time. Upon the Closing, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and
time the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the "Effective
Time").

  

  

Section 1.4. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers, and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Company.

  

  

Section 1.5. Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of
the Company will be amended in the Merger to read in its entirety as set forth
on Exhibit A hereto, and thereafter may be amended as provided therein or by
law, subject to Section 6.2.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 1.6. Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company, and thereafter may be
amended as provided therein or by law, except that references to Merger Sub's
name shall be replaced at the Effective Time with references to Artio Global
Investors Inc., subject to Section 6.2.

  

  

Section 1.7. Directors; Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company
and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Company, in each case, until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified or until their death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Company.

  

  

ARTICLE II.

  

  

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

  

Section 2.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
or the holder of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company:

  

  

(a) Cancellation of Certain Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock that is
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise) or
any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries (other
than shares held on behalf of third parties) will automatically be cancelled
and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

  

(b) Conversion of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to
be cancelled and retired in accordance with Section 2.1(a), and (ii)
Dissenting Shares (each, an "Excluded Share" and collectively, the "Excluded
Shares")) will automatically be converted into the right to receive $2.75 in
cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), payable upon surrender of
such shares in the manner provided in Section 2.4.

  

  

(c) Cancellation of Common Stock. All shares of Common Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and,
in the case of book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares"), the names of the
former registered holders shall be removed from the registry of holders of
such shares, and, subject to Sections 2.1(a) and 2.3, each holder of Book-
Entry Shares and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Common Stock (each, a
"Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of Common Stock, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.4.

  

  

(d) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into
one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. If prior to the Effective Time, the
Company should split, combine or otherwise reclassify the Common Stock, or pay
a stock dividend or other stock distribution in Common Stock or otherwise
change the Common Stock into any other securities, or make any other such
stock dividend or distribution in capital stock of the Company in respect of
the Common Stock, then any number or amount contained herein which is based
upon the price or the number of shares of Common Stock will be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such split, combination, dividend or other distribution or
change; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited or not
expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.2. Treatment of Stock Awards.

  

  

(a) Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.

  

  

By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of any outstanding Company Equity Award or
share of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plan:

  

  

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all transfer restrictions imposed
on any outstanding shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Company Stock
Plan (collectively, the "Restricted Stock") shall lapse. At the Effective
Time, the Restricted Stock shall be treated in a manner consistent with
Section 2.1(b) hereof.

  

  

(ii) Except as provided in Section 2.2(a)(iii) or (iv), at the Effective Time,
any "restricted stock units" issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plan (each,
a "Restricted Stock Unit") that are outstanding as of the Effective Time shall
be cancelled, and (A) the holder of each such Restricted Stock Unit shall
become entitled to receive, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
thereto, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the
sum of (x) for each Time-Based RSU award, the number of shares of Common Stock
represented by such Time-Based RSU award and (y) for each Performance-Based
RSU award, the number of shares of Common Stock the holder would have been
entitled to receive upon a termination resulting from a change in control
under the terms of the applicable award agreement, and (B) all dividends and
interest, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to
such Restricted Stock Units, shall vest and be paid to the holder of the
associated Restricted Stock Unit.

  

  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.2(a)(ii) or (iv) to the contrary,
each Restricted Stock Unit award held by any individual identified on Section
2.2(a)(iii) of the Disclosure Letter (each, a "Section 2.2(a)(iii) Employee")
shall, at the Effective Time, be converted automatically into an award with
respect to Parent Shares as provided in this Section 2.2(a)(iii), and Parent
shall assume all obligations with respect to such Restricted Stock Unit award,
subject to the terms of the Company Stock Plan and the applicable Restricted
Stock Unit award agreement, including with respect to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

vesting and settlement. From and after the Effective Time, the number of
Parent Shares subject to each outstanding Restricted Stock Unit award held by
a Section 2.2(a)(iii) Employee shall be equal to the product of (A) the number
of shares of Common Stock that related to such Restricted Stock Unit award
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Exchange Ratio; provided
that any fractional Parent Share resulting from the foregoing conversion shall
be rounded up to the nearest whole Parent Share. For purposes of this Section
2.2(a)(iii), "Exchange Ratio" means the quotient, rounded to the nearest
1/100th, determined by dividing the Merger Consideration by the Average Parent
Share Price. The "Average Parent Share Price" shall mean the volume weighted
average price per Parent Share on the London Stock Exchange (as reported by
Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported thereby, by another authoritative source
mutually agreed by the parties) for the five consecutive trading days
immediately preceding, and including the trading day immediately prior to the
Closing Date (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent), converted
from pounds sterling into U.S. dollars at the rate for conversion of pounds
sterling into U.S. dollars displayed (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not
reported thereby, by another authoritative source mutually agreed by the
parties) at (or if not available, most recently prior to) 4:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. The
identity of the Section 2.2(a)(iii) Employees may be updated by Parent at any
time until five Business Days prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.2(a)(ii) or (iii) to the contrary,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all obligations with
respect to each Restricted Stock Unit award held by any individual identified
on Section 2.2(a)(iv) of the Disclosure Letter (each, a "Section 2.2(a)(iv)
Employee"); provided, that each such Restricted Stock Unit award shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be notionally invested in mutual funds managed
by the Company, and allocated among such funds as may be determined by Parent,
with a value as of the Effective Time equal to the sum of (A) the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock represented
by such Restricted Stock Unit Award, and (B) all dividends and interest, if
any, accrued but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to such
Restricted Stock Units (each, a "Rollover Award"). Each Rollover Award will
remain subject to the terms of the Company Stock Plan and the applicable
Restricted Stock Unit award agreement (other than as set forth in this Section
2.2(a)(iv)), including with respect to vesting and settlement.

  

  

(v) Any amounts under this Section 2.2 shall be payable in accordance with,
and to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any penalty or other
taxes under, Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

(b) Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such
resolutions and take such other actions as are reasonably necessary in order
to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.2, without paying any
consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company
or the Surviving Company (except where specifically provided by this Section
2.2), provided that such resolutions and actions shall

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

expressly be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and shall be of no effect if this Agreement
is terminated.

  

  

(c) Parent Actions. With respect to the Restricted Stock Unit awards to be
rolled over in accordance with Section 2.2(a)(iii) (collectively, the
"Rollover RSUs"), Parent shall (i) take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery upon
settlement of the Rollover RSUs, (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts
to grant Parent Shares pursuant to a registration statement, or an exemption
from registration, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and (iii)
maintain a mechanism that enables each Section 2.2(a)(iii) Employee to
monetize in U.S. Dollars and without transaction fees Parent Shares delivered
upon settlement of the Rollover RSUs held by such Section 2.2(a)(iii) Employee
(which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, include the right of each Section
2.2(a)(iii) Employee to elect to direct Parent Shares to be sold immediately
upon the vesting of the Rollover RSUs in accordance with Parent's equity and
equity-based plans and agreements in place as of the date hereof). With
respect to the Restricted Stock Unit awards to be rolled over in accordance
with Section 2.2(a)(iii) and (iv), Parent shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, deliver to each Section 2.2(a)(iii)
Employee and Section 2.2(a)(iv) Employee written notice describing the effect
of the Merger on such Restricted Stock Unit awards.

  

  

Section 2.3. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders
that have properly perfected their rights of appraisal within the meaning of
Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such
stockholders shall have failed to perfect any available right of appraisal
under applicable law, but, instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to
payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of appraisal, the shares
of Common Stock held by such stockholder shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares
for purposes of this Agreement and shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance
with Section 2.1(b). The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt written notice
of any demands for appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
received by Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served or delivered in connection with such demands pursuant to the DGCL and
received by Company, and (b) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands made pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, (i) make any payment with respect to any such demand, (ii) offer to
settle or settle any such demand, or (iii) waive any failure to timely deliver
a written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect
appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL.

  

  

Section 2.4. Payment Fund and Payment Procedures.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of the shares
of Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares), Parent will designate, or cause
to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Paying Agent") to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of Certificates upon surrender of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II from time to time after the
Effective Time. Promptly after (but, in any event, within one Business Day
following) the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub will deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount necessary for the
payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b) in its entirety
so that such payment may be made upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares (such cash being herein referred to as the "Payment Fund").
Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement on customary terms, which
terms shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares) a letter of transmittal in customary form as
reasonably agreed by the parties specifying that delivery will be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will pass,
only upon proper delivery of Certificates (or customary effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the
Paying Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or customary effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper
surrender of a Certificate (or customary effective affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor cash in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Article II, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered will
forthwith be cancelled. Until such Certificates (or customary effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be,
are so properly delivered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as the
case may be, shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof,
subject to the terms set forth in Section 2.3. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of the shares of Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, cash to
be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share may be paid
to such a transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such shares of Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

  

  

(c) Any funds included in the Payment Fund may be invested by the Paying
Agent, as directed by Parent; provided that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Parent.

  

  

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Company, on demand, and any
holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Share who has not theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter
look only to the Surviving Company for payment of his or her claims for Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person will be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Payment
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
the holders of shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
on the date that is five (5) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date immediately prior to such date when the amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity) shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereof.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

  

  

(f) If administratively practicable, Parent may instead cause the Company to
make any payment with respect to the Company Equity Awards, other than by the
Paying Agent; provided that Parent makes such request at a reasonable time
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 2.5. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate
or other documentation (including an indemnity in customary form) reasonably
requested by Parent, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

  

  

Section 2.6. Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Company and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock or
any holder of a Company Equity Award such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Common Stock or the holder of a Company Equity Award
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Company or Parent, as the case may be.

  

  

Section 2.7. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or
in connection with, the Merger.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.8. Stock Transfer Books. At the close of business, New York time, on
the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock
formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law.

being referred to herein collectively as the "Company Subsidiary Securities").
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

subject to any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to repurchase or otherwise
acquire or retire, or to register under the Securities Act, any Company
Subsidiary Securities.

  

  

Section 3.8. Company SEC Reports; Related Matters.

  

  

(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished, as applicable, each report,
proxy statement, registration statement, prospectus, schedule, form,
statement, certification and other document (including exhibits and all other
information incorporated by reference therein) required to be filed or
furnished by it with the SEC since January 1, 2010 (the "Company SEC
Reports"). As of their respective dates, after giving effect to any amendments
or supplements thereto filed prior to the date hereof, the Company SEC Reports
(including any schedules or exhibits included or incorporated by reference
therein) (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to the Company SEC Reports. None of the Company SEC Reports is the
subject of an ongoing SEC review. There are no SEC inquiries or
investigations, other governmental inquiries or investigations or internal
investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting
practice of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof.

  

  

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, the notes, if any,
thereto) included in the Company SEC Reports (i) complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto and except with respect to unaudited
statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and (iii) fairly presented
(subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements included
therein, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments as permitted by GAAP and
the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC) in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods then ended.

  

  

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented, and maintain and
enforce, (i) disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information relating to the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries is made
known to the management of the Company by others within those entities, and
(ii) a system of internal control over financial reporting sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Neither the Company nor its independent accountants has
identified or been made aware of (A) any significant deficiency or material
weakness in the system of internal controls over financial reporting utilized
by the Company, or (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
executive officers or other employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who

investment guidelines and restrictions, the Investment Company Act and/or the
Advisers Act, as applicable, and applicable Law, in each case, in all material

report referenced in clause (A)(i) or (ii) above, or (C) such other
liabilities and obligations that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on such Fund or a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No Fund is party to or subject to any
contract, agreement or other arrangement that would be a "Material Contract"
if the Company were a party that is in violation, breach or event of default,
or event or condition that, after notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a violation, breach or event of default thereunder, on the part of
the Fund, or to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, except

business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted has

securities Laws of each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business
requires

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25

Material Adverse Effect. The Broker-Dealer Subsidiary is a member in good
standing of FINRA and each other Self-Regulatory Organization where the
conduct of its business requires such membership, except where the failure to
be in such good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a

Subsidiary has timely filed all required Form BDs and amendments to Form BD,
and each Form BD or amendment to Form BD of the Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, as
of the date of filing with the SEC and FINRA did not contain any untrue

stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Broker-
Dealer Subsidiary has implemented written policies and procedures as required

required in the future), whether oral or written, in each case, sponsored,
maintained, contributed or required to be contributed to by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or under which the Company or any Subsidiary has any current or
potential liability.

events have occurred and no circumstances exist that could reasonably be
expected to result in any such liability to the Company or any current or
former member of its "controlled group" (within the meaning of Section 414 of
the Code). No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code. No Employee Benefit Plan is subject

received a determination letter (or opinion letter in the case of any
prototype plan) from the IRS that it is so qualified and that its trust is
exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, and to the Knowledge of the
Company nothing has occurred that could adversely affect such qualification or
exemption or cause the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax
under ERISA or the Code. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
all amendments and actions required to bring the Employee Benefit Plans into
conformity with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws have been made or taken except to the extent that such
amendments or actions are not required by applicable Laws to be made or taken

has been established and administered in accordance with its terms, and in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Laws; (ii) all contributions (including all employer contributions
and employee salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under
any of the Employee Benefit Plans to any funds or trusts established
thereunder or in connection therewith have been made by the due date thereof
and all contributions for any period ending on or before the Closing Date
which are not yet due will have been paid or accrued prior

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

to the Closing Date; and (iii) none of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any "party in interest" or "disqualified person"
with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans has engaged in a non-exempt
"prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or 4975 of
the Code pursuant to which the tax or penalty could be material.

  

  

(f) There are no material pending actions, claims or lawsuits which have been
instituted against the Employee Benefit Plans, the assets of any of the trusts

administration of such plans or the investment of plan assets (other than
routine benefit claims) and no Employee Benefit Plan has been the subject of
an audit, investigation or examination by any Governmental Entity to the
Knowledge of the Company.

  

  

(g) None of the Employee Benefit Plans provide retiree health or life
insurance benefits except as may be required by Section 4980B of the Code and
Section 601 of ERISA, any other applicable Laws or at the expense of the
participant or the participant's beneficiary.

  

  

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination
with another event) (i) result in any payment becoming due, or increase the
amount of any compensation or benefits due, to any current or former employee
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit
Plan; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of
any such compensation or benefits; or (iv) result in a non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code.

  

  

(i) No Contract, Employee Benefit Plan, warrant or other compensatory or
equity-based arrangement with any employee, officer or director of the Company
contains any provision requiring the Company to pay on behalf of, or otherwise
reimburse, any such individual for any income or excise taxes due by such
individual upon payment of any benefits by the Company.

complete and accurate copies of all material surety bonds, fidelity bonds and

operations. All such policies and bonds are in full force and effect. Except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries is in default under

request of Parent, the Company shall provide Parent with a true and accurate
list of the members of the board of directors (or equivalent governing body)
of the Subsidiaries of the Company.

  

  

Section 5.3. Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall

ARTICLE VI.

  

  

CERTAIN COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

  

  

Section 6.1. Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) During the twelve (12) month period commencing at the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Continuing
Employees") while such Continuing Employee remains in the employment of the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries, with (i) a base salary, wage or
commission rate and bonus and incentive compensation opportunity at least
equal to the Continuing Employee's base salary, wage or commission rate and
bonus and incentive compensation opportunity in effect as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (other than any incentive
compensation, equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and
retiree medical benefits, if any) that are that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to either (1) the employee benefits (other than any incentive
compensation, equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and
retiree medical benefits) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (2) such
employee benefits (other than any incentive compensation, equity-based
compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and retiree medical benefits)
provided to employees of the Parent and its Subsidiaries who are similarly
situated to such Continuing Employee; provided that, to the extent a
Continuing Employee is a party to a Contract that entitles the Continuing
Employee to a certain base salary, wage or commission rate, bonus and
incentive compensation opportunity or employee benefits, such Continuing
Employee shall be entitled to receive such compensation and benefits in
accordance with such Contract.

  

  

(b) With respect to any Continuing Employee who is a participant in the Green
Lantern Severance Pay Plan (the "Company Severance Pay Plan") immediately
prior to the Effective Time and whose employment with Parent and its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) is involuntarily terminated
without "cause" during the twelve (12) month period commencing at the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to
provide, such Continuing Employee with severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits, if any, that would have been provided
pursuant to the terms of the Company Severance Pay Plan to such Continuing
Employee upon an involuntary termination of employment immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however, that no such severance benefits shall
be provided to any Continuing Employee who is a party to a Contract that
otherwise provides for severance benefits.

  

  

(c) For purposes of eligibility and vesting under the benefit plans, programs
agreements and arrangements of Parent and any of its Subsidiaries or any
respective Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any Continuing Employees
after the Effective Time, and in which such Continuing Employees did not
participate prior to the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), including for
purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits
under New Plans (but excluding any New Plan that is established after the
Effective Time that does not recognize service prior to its adoption equally
for all employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries), each Continuing Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any substantially similar Employee Benefit Plan, except
where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under
an Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately before such replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived, or caused to
be waived, for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under an Employee Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year
prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.

  

  

(d) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Company to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this Section
6.1 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing
herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i)
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans
maintained for or provided to employees prior to or following the Effective
Time or (ii) confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of
doubt any current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided
for in this Section 6.1) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.2. Indemnification Continuation.

  

  

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnifying Party") will,
and Parent will cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, from and
after the Effective Time, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent permitted or required by applicable Law, each present or former
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties") against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, legal and other expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement or actually and reasonably incurred by any such Indemnified Party
in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in respect of any
actions or omissions (or alleged actions or omissions) by any such Indemnified
Party prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, each Indemnified Party will be
entitled to advancement of fees and expenses incurred in the defense of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation within thirty (30) days
of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Company from the Indemnified Party of a
request

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

therefor, subject to the Surviving Company's receipt of an undertaking
(without the posting of any bond or other collateral) by such Indemnified
Party to repay such fees and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a
final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law;
provided, however, that (i) the Surviving Company will not be liable for any
settlement effected without the Surviving Company's prior written consent and
(ii) the Surviving Company and Parent shall cooperate in the defense of any
such matter.

  

  

(b) The Surviving Company will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company
to, (i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided
that the Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies, of at least the
same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not
less advantageous in any material respect to the directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries when compared to the insurance maintained by the
Company as of the date hereof), or (ii) obtain as of the Effective Time "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous in any material respect to the
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before
or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that in no event will the
Surviving Company be required to expend for such coverage (A) an annual
premium in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium
paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement,
which amount is set forth on Section 6.2(b) of the Disclosure Letter (in the
case of clause (i) above) or (B) an aggregate premium in excess of the
aggregate premiums payable pursuant to the foregoing clause (A) (in the case
of clause (ii) above) (the maximum annual or aggregate premium payable
pursuant to clause (A) or (B), as applicable, the "Maximum Premium"). If the
insurance coverage cannot be obtained at either an annual premium or an
aggregate premium, as the case may be, that is equal to or less than the
applicable Maximum Premium, the Surviving Company will obtain, and Parent will
cause the Surviving Company to obtain, the maximum amount of directors' and
officers' insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual or aggregate
premium, as the case may be, equal to the applicable Maximum Premium.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.2 will survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and its successors and representatives after the Effective
Time and their rights under this Section 6.2 are in addition to, and will not
be deemed to be exclusive of, any other rights to which an Indemnified Party
is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract, the Company Organizational
Documents or similar organizational document of the Surviving Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or otherwise.

  

  

(d) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause them to, include and maintain in
effect in their respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
organizational document) for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, provisions regarding the elimination of liability of directors (or their
equivalent), indemnification of officers and directors thereof and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

advancement of expenses which are, in the aggregate with respect to each such
entity, no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions contained in such organizational documents as of the
date of this Agreement.

  

  

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Company, any Subsidiary thereof or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent, the Surviving Company or any such Subsidiary, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.2.

  

  

Section 6.3. Certain Notices. From and after the date hereof and until the
earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article IX hereof, Parent and Merger Sub will notify the Company
in writing promptly of (a) any material written communication received by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) without limitation of the
terms set forth in Article VII, any material written communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (c) any Action commenced against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Subsidiaries that is related, in whole or in part, to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (d) any event, change or effect between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is
reasonably likely to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections
8.3(a) or 8.3(b) of this Agreement not to be satisfied at the Closing.

  

  

ARTICLE VII.

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of,

efforts to (i) solicit from the holders of Common Stock proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger, and (ii) take all
other reasonable actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent

Stockholders Meeting, and (vi) otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts
to comply with all requirements of Law applicable to the Company Stockholders
Meeting. Parent and Merger Sub shall each cooperate with the Company in
connection with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including
furnishing the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable with any and all
reasonable information with respect to Parent and Merger Sub as may be
required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under the Exchange Act. The

Section 7.2. Investment Advisory Arrangement Consents.

  

  

(a) If consent to the assignment or deemed assignment of an Investment
Advisory Arrangement with Clients (other than Public Funds) of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is required by applicable Law or by such Client's Investment
Advisory Arrangement, as promptly as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company and each such Subsidiary shall send a written notice
(the "Notice"), which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, informing such Clients of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and requesting written consent to the assignment or deemed
assignment of such Client's Investment Advisory Arrangement. At the request of
Parent, and provided that the same is permitted pursuant to the applicable
Investment Advisory Arrangement, the Company and each such Subsidiary shall
also send a written notice (the "Negative Consent Notice"), which shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to such Clients (which
Negative Consent Notice may, if requested by Parent, be included in the
Notice) requesting written consent as aforesaid and informing such Client: (i)
of the intention to complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
which will result in a deemed assignment of such Investment Advisory
Arrangement; (ii) of the intention of the Company or such Subsidiary to
continue to provide the advisory services pursuant to the existing Investment
Advisory Arrangement with such Client after the Closing if such Client does
not terminate such agreement prior to the Closing; and (iii) that the consent
of such Client will be deemed to have been granted if such Client continues to
accept such advisory services for a period of at least forty-five (45) days
after the sending of the Negative Consent Notice without termination. With
respect to each Private Fund, any Notice or Negative Consent Notice shall be
sent to each limited partner or other investor in the Private Fund. At the
reasonable request of Parent, the Company shall cause the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Investment Adviser Subsidiary to (x) provide a notice to any Client that has
not consented to the assignment prior to the Closing stating that such
Client's account may be terminated if such consent is not received by the
Closing and (y) subject to its fiduciary duties, terminate the Investment
Advisory Arrangement with such Client effective immediately prior to the
Closing if such consent has not been received.

  

  

(b) The Company and the Investment Adviser Subsidiary shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to, in accordance with applicable Law, (i) as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement obtain the approval
of each of the Public Fund Boards of a new Investment Advisory Arrangement, to
be effective as of the Closing Date, containing terms substantially comparable
to (but providing for fees (after giving effect to any waivers or other
reductions thereof) no less favorable to the Company and the Investment
Adviser Subsidiary than) the applicable existing Investment Advisory
Arrangement as in effect on the date hereof (or, if entered into or amended
after the date hereof in accordance with this Agreement, as in effect on the
date of the execution or amendment thereof), and (ii) request the Public Funds
to obtain, as promptly as practicable following such approval of the Public
Fund Boards, the necessary approval of the shareholders of each Public Fund
(except if not required under exemptive orders granted under the Investment
Company Act by the SEC with respect to any Public Funds not sponsored by the
Company or its Subsidiaries) of such new Investment Advisory Arrangement
containing terms that are substantially comparable to (but providing for fees
(after giving effect to any waivers or other reductions thereof) no less
favorable to the Company and the Investment Adviser Subsidiary than) the
applicable existing Investment Advisory Arrangement as in effect on the date
hereof (or, in entered into or amended after the date hereof in accordance
with this Agreement, as in effect on the date of the execution or amendment
thereof). The parties agree that consent for any Investment Advisory
Arrangement with a Public Fund ("Public Fund Consent") shall be deemed given
for all purposes under this Agreement if a new Investment Advisory Arrangement
has been approved in accordance with the preceding sentence (including in
respect of the terms thereof) and is in full force and effect at the Closing;
provided that, notwithstanding the terms set forth in the two immediately
preceding sentences, the term "Public Fund Consent" shall not include any
interim Investment Advisory Arrangement approved in accordance with Rule 15a-4
under the Investment Company Act (although the Company may nonetheless in its
discretion seek, and upon the request of Parent, shall seek, the approval by
the applicable Public Fund Board pursuant to such Rule 15a-4 of an interim
Investment Advisory Arrangement for any Public Fund with respect to any period
after Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement).

required by subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.2, at all times prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall take reasonable steps to keep Parent
promptly informed of the status of obtaining such Client consents and, upon
Parent's request, make available to Parent copies of all such executed Client
consents and make available for Parent's inspection the originals of such
consents and any related materials and other records relating to the Client
consent process. Without limiting the foregoing or the terms set forth in
Section 7.3, in connection with obtaining the Client consents required under
subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.2, Parent shall have the right to
review in advance of distribution any notices or other materials to be
distributed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Clients and shall
have the right to have its reasonable comments reflected therein prior to
distribution.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 7.3. Public Funds Proxy Statements; Fund Registration Statements.

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable following approval of the Public Fund Boards
described in Section 7.2(b), the Company or one of its Subsidiaries will (in
coordination with the applicable Public Fund and under the general direction
of the applicable Public Fund Board) prepare and file proxy materials for the
Public Fund shareholder meeting to approve the new Investment Advisory
Arrangement as contemplated by Section 7.2(b). The Company shall provide
Parent with drafts of the proxy materials (and any SEC comments thereto) on a
timely basis and Parent shall have the right to review in advance of
submission to the SEC the proxy materials (and any amendment or supplement
thereto) to be furnished to the shareholders of any Public Fund and to (i)
approve information or data that is provided by or on behalf of Parent or its
Affiliates specifically for inclusion in such proxy materials, and (ii)
provide comments on such proxy materials which the Company (in coordination
with the applicable Public Fund and under the general direction of the
applicable Public Fund Board) will use commercially reasonable efforts to
include therein.

  

  

(b) As soon as possible following the date hereof, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Public Fund then engaged in a
public offering of its shares to (i) file supplements or amendments to its
prospectus forming a part of its registration statement then currently in use,
which supplements or amendments shall disclose the transactions contemplated
hereby to the extent required by applicable Law, and (ii) make any other
filing necessary under any applicable Law to satisfy in all material respects
disclosure requirements in connection with the public distribution of the
shares of that Public Fund. Parent shall have the right to provide comments on
such materials to the same extent as provided in Section 7.3(a).

  

  

Section 7.4. Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act.

  

  

(a) Parent acknowledges that the Company has entered into this Agreement in
reliance upon the benefits and protections provided by Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act. In furtherance (and not limitation) of the foregoing,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts
to conduct its business to enable the following to be true regarding Section
15(f) of the Investment Company Act in relation to any Public Fund for which
any Subsidiary of the Company provides investment advisory or sub-advisory
services: (a) for a period of not less than three (3) years after the
Effective Time (and provided the 75% standard for disinterested directors is
in effect at the Closing), no more than 25% of the members of the board of
directors or trustees of any Public Fund shall be "interested persons" (as
defined in the Investment Company Act) of the Company, any Subsidiary, the
Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other investment adviser for such
Public Fund, and (b) for a period of not less than two (2) years after the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall impose an
"unfair burden" (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, including
any interpretations or no-action letters of the SEC) on any such Public Fund
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(b) For a period of three years after the Closing Date, Parent shall not
engage, and shall cause its Affiliates not to engage, in any transaction that
would constitute an "assignment" (as that term is defined under applicable
provisions of the Investment Company

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Act and interpreted by the SEC) to a third party of any Investment Advisory
Arrangement between Parent or any of its Affiliates and any Public Fund,
without first using reasonable best efforts to obtain from the counterparty to
such transaction a covenant in all material respects comparable to that
contained in this Section 7.4.

  

  

Section 7.5. Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (and, subject to the fiduciary duties of
it and its Subsidiaries, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Funds to), afford to Parent and its representatives and advisors
reasonable access during normal business hours, during the period prior to the
Effective Time, to all of the officers, employees, properties, offices, other
facilities and all books and records of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Funds, and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to (and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Funds to), furnish promptly to Parent and its representatives and
advisors, all other data, information, agreements and documents concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent or its representatives or
advisors may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company may
restrict the foregoing access to the extent that, in the Company's reasonable
judgment, (i) providing such access would violate any of its contractual
obligations to a third party with respect to confidentiality, or (ii) any Law
applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Funds requires the Company,
its Subsidiaries or the Funds to preclude Parent or its representatives or
advisors from gaining access to such properties or information; provided,
further, that Parent and its representatives and advisors shall not have
access to individual performance or evaluation records or medical histories or
information that is subject to attorney-client privilege or other privilege.
Parent will hold, and will cause its representatives and advisors to hold, any
information or documents received or provided pursuant to this Section 7.5 in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of that certain letter agreement, dated December 10, 2012 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), between the Company and Parent. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no investigation by
Parent or its representatives or advisors shall affect the representations,
warranties, agreements, covenants or conditions of the parties set forth in
this Agreement, including the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII
hereof.

  

  

Section 7.6. Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including those contained in this Section 7.6(a)), each of the parties hereto
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, and to satisfy all
conditions to, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entities, including, but not limited to,
FINRA, the NYSE and the NFA, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents or
waivers from third parties required as a result of or in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Merger and to fully carry

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

out the purposes of this Agreement. The Company and Parent and their
respective counsel shall, subject to applicable Law, promptly (x) cooperate
and coordinate with the other in the taking of the actions contemplated by
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) immediately above and (y) supply the other with
any information that may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the
taking of such actions. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other
party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any material communication
from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If the Company or Parent receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then it shall use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request, and, if permitted by applicable Law
and by any applicable Governmental Entity, provide the other party and its
counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to participate in any material
meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing made thereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to Section
7.6(a) hereof, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable to Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over the
HSR Act (each such Governmental Entity, a "Governmental Antitrust Authority")
information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Authority as
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing any
notification and report form and related material required under the HSR Act
as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and thereafter
to respond as promptly as practicable to any request for additional
information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act, and
(ii) subject to the terms set forth in Section 7.6(c) hereof, use their
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to
obtain prompt approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable waiting
periods.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
will not without Parent's prior written consent, agree to any divestiture of
shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their
businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock
to avoid or eliminate any impediment under the HSR Act.

  

  

Section 7.7. Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) Subject to the remainder of this Section 7.7, none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall (whether directly or indirectly through Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, representatives, advisors or other
intermediaries), nor shall (directly or indirectly) the Company authorize or
permit any of its or its Subsidiaries' controlled Affiliates, officers,
directors, representatives, advisors or other intermediaries or Subsidiaries
to: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate the submission of inquiries,
proposals or offers from any Person (other than Parent) relating to any
Acquisition Proposal, or agree to or recommend any Acquisition

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Proposal; (ii) enter into any agreement to (x) consummate any Acquisition
Proposal, (y) approve any Acquisition Proposal or (z) in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal, require it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the Merger; (iii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or furnish to any Person any non-public information with
respect to its business, properties or assets in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) agree to resolve to take, or take, any of the
actions prohibited by clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence. The Company
shall immediately cease, and cause its representatives, advisors and other
intermediaries to immediately cease, any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any of the foregoing. Any violation of this Section 7.7 by any officer,
director or representative of the Company (other than the Persons listed in
Section 7.7 of the Disclosure Letter) shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 7.7 by the Company. For purposes of this Section 7.7, the term
"Person" means any person, corporation, entity or "group," as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the Company,
Parent or any Subsidiaries of Parent.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company
(acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee), directly or
indirectly through Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
representatives, advisors or other intermediaries, may, prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (i) comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to any Acquisition Proposal (provided that
any action taken or statement made to so comply that relates to an Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless
the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee) reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
statement or in connection with such action), or issue a "stop, look and
listen" statement, (ii) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Person
(and its representatives, advisors and intermediaries) that has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not resulting from or
arising out of a breach of Section 7.7(a), and/or (iii) furnish to such Person
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and to the extent nonpublic information
that has not been made available to Parent is made available to such Person,
make available or furnish such nonpublic information to Parent substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person, in the case of each of
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), if, and only if, prior to taking such particular
action, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting upon the recommendation
of the Special Committee) has determined in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.7 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Required Company Vote, the Company's Board of
Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) may (x)
withdraw, modify or amend in any manner adverse to Parent its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger (a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change") (i) in response to an Intervening Event, or (ii)
following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.7 and which the Company's
Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
determines in good faith, in consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel is a Superior Proposal, in each case, if and only if,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the Company's Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
and subject to the Company's compliance with Section 7.7(d) or (y) following
receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this Section 7.7 and which the Company's Board of
Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) determines
in good faith, in consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel is a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement in accordance with
the provisions of Section 9.1(f) for the purpose of entering into a definitive
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (a
"Company Acquisition Agreement") with respect to such Superior Proposal, if,
and only if, the Company's Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation
of the Special Committee) has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and the Company complies with Section 7.7(d) and, concurrently
with entering into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company pays the Termination Fee in accordance with
Section 9.2(c).

  

  

(d) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under Section
7.7(c)(x)(i), the Company shall provide Parent with prior written notice
advising Parent it intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, or (ii) under
Section 7.7(c)(x)(ii) or Section 7.7(c)(y) the Company shall provide Parent
with five (5) Business Days' prior written notice (it being understood and
agreed that any material amendment to the amount or form of consideration
payable in connection with the applicable Acquisition Proposal shall require a
new notice and an additional three (3) Business Day period) advising Parent
that the Company's Board of Directors (acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee) intends to take such action, and if applicable, specifying
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal and that the
Company shall, during such five (5) Business Day period (or subsequent three
(3) Business Day period, if applicable), negotiate in good faith with Parent
to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

  

  

(e) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 24
hours) after receipt or occurrence of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
proposals, discussions, negotiations or inquiries that would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person
making any such Acquisition Proposal or with whom such discussions or
negotiations are taking place, in each case, if such request for information,
inquiry or proposal or discussions or negotiations would reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. In addition, the Company shall
promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) after the receipt thereof, provide
to Parent copies of any written documentation material to understanding such
Acquisition Proposal which is received by the Company from the Person (or from
any representatives, advisors or agents of such Person) making such
Acquisition Proposal or with whom discussions or negotiations would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify
any provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which
it or any of its

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company has waived any provision in any such agreement that prohibits the
counterparty thereto from confidentially requesting the Company to amend or
waive the standstill provision in such agreement (i.e., a "don\'t ask to
waive" provision) to the extent necessary (any only to such extent) to enable
such counterparty to convey confidentially to the Board of Directors of the
Company an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and material details (including any amendments or
proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent
reasonably informed as to the material details of all discussions or
negotiations with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal (in each case in a
manner that is not unduly disruptive of the Company's ability to conduct good
faith discussions in accordance with this Section 7.7 with the party making
such Acquisition Proposal and its representatives, advisors and agents) and
shall provide Parent within 24 hours after receipt thereof all copies of any
other documentation material to understanding such Acquisition Proposal (as
determined by the Company in good faith) received by the Company from the
Person (or from any representatives, advisors or agents of such Person) making
such Acquisition Proposal or with whom such discussions or negotiations are
taking place; provided that, for the sake of clarity, it is understood and
agreed that all such information and communications shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent any
material non-public information concerning the Company provided to any other
Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously
provided to Parent. The Board of Directors of the Company shall promptly
consider in good faith (in consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) any proposed alteration of the terms of this Agreement or
the Merger proposed by Parent. Except in connection with a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f), the Company shall not take any action to
exempt any Person from, or make any acquisition of securities of the Company
by any Person not subject to, any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation that applies to Company with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
otherwise, including the restrictions on "business combinations" set forth in

in connection with any such stockholder litigation shall be agreed to by the
Company or any director or officer thereof without Parent's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  

  

Section 7.9. Public Announcements. Except with respect to any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or any other action taken by the Company or the Board of
Directors of the Company pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 7.7
hereof, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that no public
release or public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the Company
and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States or
United Kingdom securities exchange, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance (and the disclosing party will
consider such comments in good faith).

  

  

Section 7.10. Takeover Statutes. If any business combination, control share
acquisition, fair price or similar statute is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Voting Agreements, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and their
respective boards of directors (in the case of the Company, the Board of
Directors of the Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) will (a) take all necessary action to ensure that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such takeover statute.

Stock of the Company is listed to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Company of the shares of Common Stock from the NYSE and the other exchanges on
which the Common Stock of the Company is listed and the deregistration of the
shares of Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time.

cause the Investment Adviser Subsidiary to reaffirm all CFTC Rule 4.13(a)(3)

any Private Fund; and (ii) the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Public Funds to reaffirm all CFTC Rule 4.5 notices of

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

sentence of Section 7.5 and Article X which shall remain in full force and
effect; provided, however, that the termination of this Agreement shall not
relieve any party from any liability for damages caused by an intentional
breach by such party of its covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, a breach by such party of its representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement where such breach was made with knowledge thereof, or
the intentional failure by such party to fulfill a condition to the
performance of the obligations of the other party (it being understood and
agreed such damages shall not be limited to the reimbursement of the non-
breaching party's costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement).

  

  

(b) If Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e) (or if
the Company or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(b) or Section 9.1(d)(i) but at the time of such termination, Parent had
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e) (other than
pursuant to Section 9.1(e)(ii))), then the Company shall pay to Parent not
later than two (2) Business Days following such termination, an amount in cash
equal to $5,700,000 (the "Termination Fee") with the payment of the
Termination Fee being made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such bank account as Parent may designate in writing to the Company in
connection with the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) If the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f),
then the Company shall pay to Parent prior to or concurrently with such
termination, the Termination Fee, with the payment of the Termination Fee
being made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank
account as Parent may designate in writing to the Company in connection with
the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) If (i) the Company or Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(b) and provided that the Required Company Vote shall not have been
obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof) or (ii) the Company or Parent shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i), and in the case of clauses (i) and
(ii) immediately above, (A) prior to the termination of this Agreement (in the
case of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b)) or prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
9.1(d)(i)), there shall have been proposed to the Company or publicly
disclosed or announced a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, and (B) within twelve
(12) months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a
Company Acquisition Agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) with respect to (and at any time thereafter consummates), or
consummates, an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal
is the same Acquisition Proposal that was so proposed to the Company or
otherwise so publicly disclosed or announced), then, on and subject in all
respects to the consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall
pay the Termination Fee to Parent, less the amount of any Parent Expenses
previously paid by the Company to Parent, with the payment of the Termination
Fee being made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank
account as Parent may designate in writing to the Company in connection with
Parent's receipt of written notice from the Company informing Parent of the
entry into such Company Acquisition Agreement or the consummation of such
Acquisition Proposal, as applicable. For purposes of this Section 9.2(d),
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement that may be deemed to the contrary,
the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 10.13, except that the references to "more than 15%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "a
majority" instead.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
9.1(d)(i), the Company shall pay the Parent Expenses to Parent, which shall be
paid to Parent in cash within two (2) Business Days after delivery to the
Company of written notice of the amount of such Parent Expenses, with the
payment of such Parent Expenses being made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such bank account as Parent may designate in writing to the
Company in connection with the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
are not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub
would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay promptly any
amount due to Parent pursuant to this Section 9.2, the Company will also pay
to Parent the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred by Parent in connection with any action, including the
filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment,
together with interest on the amount of the unpaid amount due to Parent under
this Section 9.2, accruing from its due date, at an interest rate equal to 6%
per annum. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement that may be deemed to
the contrary, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination
Fee more than once.

  

  

(g) Parent and Merger Sub agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable by the Company
pursuant to this Section and such Termination Fee is paid in full, Parent and
Merger Sub shall be precluded from any other remedy against the Company (and
any Person making any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, if
applicable), at law or in equity or otherwise.

  

  

Section 9.3. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors (in the
case of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee), at any time before or after approval
of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of
the Company, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by
Law requires further approval by such stockholders without such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

  

Section 9.4. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors (in the case of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company,
acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee), may, to the extent
legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Persons entitled to indemnification or insurance, as the case may be, are the
intended beneficiaries following the Effective Time), nothing in this
Agreement is intended to confer, and does not confer, any rights or remedies

warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in
the corresponding section of this Agreement, and (b) any other representations
and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained
in any other section of this Agreement, but only to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to such other section. The inclusion of any information in the
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in

disclosed or made available, is material, has resulted in or would result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside the ordinary course of business.
