GUARANTY 

 



 

THIS  UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTY OF PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE (" ** _Guaranty_**
")  is  made as of the 23 day of April, 2007 by Cleco Corporation, a
Louisiana  corporation (" ** _Guarantor_** "),  in  favor of Calpine Acadia
Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company  (" ** _Seller_** "). 
All  of the obligations of Guarantor arising hereunder shall be binding on
the  undersigned, and its successors and assigns, and the term " **
_Guarantor_** " shall  mean all of such parties and each of them
individually.

 



 

**_RECITALS_**

 



 

WHEREAS,  pursuant to that certain Purchase Agreement (the " ** _PA_** ") 
dated  as of April 23, 2007, by and between Seller and Acadia Power Holdings,
LLC,  a  Louisiana limited liability company (" ** _Buyer_** "),  Buyer 
has entered into an agreement to purchase the Ownership Interests and
Related  Assets in a sale authorized by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to,
_inter  alia_ ,  sections 105, 363, and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code;

 



 

WHEREAS,  Seller  is  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Calpine
Corporation, a Delaware  corporation (" ** _C_** ** _alpine_** ");

 

 

WHEREAS,  Calpine and Seller each filed a Chapter 11 Case on December 20, 
2005;

 

 

WHEREAS,  Guarantor is an Affiliate of Buyer;

 



 

WHEREAS,  all capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings
set forth  in  the PA; and

 



 

WHEREAS,  Guarantor shall derive benefits from the PA.

 



 

 

**_AGREEMENT_**

 



 

NOW,  THEREFORE, as a material inducement to Seller to enter into the PA 
with  Buyer, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and 
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and confessed, Guarantor does 
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally, warrant and represent unto and
covenant  and agree with Seller as follows:

 



 

**Section ** **1** **.** **_Guaranty  of Payment_** **.**   Guarantor
hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to  Seller and
its successors, endorsees, transferees and assigns the punctual  and 
complete payment when due (including interest accruing after the
commencement  of  any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding by or against
Buyer, whether or not  allowed in such proceeding) of the sums of money now
or hereafter due and  owing  by Buyer pursuant to the terms of the PA.

 



 

The  Guaranty of Guarantor as set forth in this _Section  1_   is a 
continuing guaranty of payment and not a guaranty of collection.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Section ** **2** **.** **_Guaranty  of Performance_** **.**   Guarantor
additionally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees  to 
Seller the timely performance of all other obligations of Buyer under the 
PA.  (The  obligations of Guarantor as set forth in _Sections  1_   and 
_2_   are  collectively referred to as the " ** _Guaranteed  Obligations_**
"). 

 



 

**Section ** **3** **.** **_Primary  Liability of Guarantor_** **.**  
Guarantor shall be liable for the payment and performance of the Guaranteed 
Obligations, as set forth in this Guaranty, as a primary obligor. This
Guaranty  shall be effective as a waiver of, and Guarantor hereby expressly
waives,  any  and all rights to which Guarantor may otherwise have been
entitled under  any  suretyship laws in effect from time to time in the
State of New York. 

 



 

In  the  event of default by Buyer in payment or performance of the
Guaranteed  Obligations, or any part thereof, when such payment or
performance becomes  due,  Guarantor shall, on demand and without further
notice of nonpayment or  nonperformance, or any other notice whatsoever, pay
the amount due thereon  to  Seller or perform or observe the agreement,
covenant, term or condition,  as the  case may be, and it shall not be
necessary for Seller, in order to enforce  such  payment or performance by
Guarantor, first to institute suit or pursue or  exhaust any rights or
remedies against Buyer or others liable for such payment  or for such
performance, or to join Buyer for the payment or performance  of the 
Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof in any action to enforce this 
Guaranty, or to resort to any other means of obtaining payment or
performance  of  the Guaranteed Obligations.

 



 

Suit  may  be brought or demand may be made against Buyer or against all
parties who  have  signed this Guaranty or against any one or more of them,
separately or together,  without impairing the rights of Seller against any
party hereto. Any time  that  Seller is entitled to exercise its rights or
remedies hereunder, it may in  its  discretion elect to demand payment,
performance or payment in lieu of  performance, all to the extent of its
right to so elect under the terms of  the PA.  If  Seller has the right to
demand performance, such election shall not affect  Seller's right to demand
payment thereafter if the performance is not fulfilled  as is otherwise
permitted by the PA  until  all of the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid
and performed in  full.

 



 

**Section ** **4** **.** **_Certain  Agreements and Waivers by Guarantor_**
**.**   Guarantor hereby agrees that Seller's rights or remedies and all
Guarantor's  obligations under the terms of this Guaranty shall remain in
full force and  effect and shall not be released, diminished, impaired or
reduced by, or  deemed  to be satisfied by, nor shall Guarantor be
exonerated, discharged or released  (by virtue of any law, rule, arrangement
or relationship) by, any one or  more of  the following events, actions,
facts, or circumstances, and the liability  of  Guarantor under this
Guaranty shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective  of:

of  recourse with respect to, any or all of the Guaranteed  Obligations;

         |  

(ii)

    |  

whether  express or by operation of any statute, regulation or rule of law,

the  liability of Guarantor hereunder, or any complete or partial release 
of  Buyer or any other party liable, directly or indirectly, for the 
payment  or performance of any or all of the

power of Buyer or any other party at any time liable for the payment  or 
performance of any or all of the Guaranteed  Obligations;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

         |  

(iv)

    |  

either  with or without notice to or consent of Guarantor, any renewal, 
extension,  modification, supplement, subordination or rearrangement of the 
terms of  any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations, including, without
limitation,  material alterations of the terms of payment or performance or 
any other  terms thereof, or any waiver, termination, or release of, or
consent  to  departure from, the PA  or  any adjustment, indulgence,
forbearance, or compromise that may  be granted  from time to time by Seller
to Buyer and/or any other person (other  than  Guarantor) at any time liable
for the payment or performance of  any or all  of the Guaranteed
Obligations;

         |  

(v)

    |  

any  neglect, lack of diligence, delay, omission, failure, or refusal  of

the  collection or enforcement of any of the Guaranteed  Obligations;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

         |  

(vi)

    |  

if  for any reason Seller is required to refund any payment by Buyer  or
any  other party liable for the payment or performance of any or all  of
the  Guaranteed Obligations or pay the amount thereof to someone else, 
except  in the event the Deposits are returned to Buyer in accordance with 
_Sections  12.2(b)_ ,  _12.4(b)_   or  _12.5(b)_   of  the PA;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

         |  

(vii)

    |  

the  existence of any claim, set-off, or other right that Guarantor  may at

arising in connection with this Guaranty, or the PA; 

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

         |  

(viii)

    |  

the  unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations 
against  Buyer because the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, 
is  _ultra  vires_   or  because the officers or persons creating the
Guaranteed Obligations  acted  in excess of their authority or because of a
lack of validity of  or of  defect or deficiency in the PA,  it being
agreed that Guarantor shall remain liable on the Guaranteed  Obligations, or
any part thereof, for any reason (and regardless  of any  joinder of Buyer
or any other party in any action to obtain payment  or  performance of any
or all of the Guaranteed Obligations) described  in this  paragraph; or

         |  

(ix)

    |

other  person, including any extension, reduction, composition, or other 
alteration of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not consented  to by 
Seller.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

In  the event any payment by Buyer  or any other person to Seller is held to
constitute a preference,  fraudulent transfer or other voidable payment under
any bankruptcy, insolvency  or similar law, or if for any other reason Seller
is required to refund  such  payment or pay the amount thereof to any other
party, such payment by Buyer  or  any other party to Seller shall not
constitute a release of Guarantor from  any  liability hereunder, and this
Guaranty shall continue to be effective or  shall  be reinstated
(notwithstanding any prior release, surrender or discharge  by  Seller of
this Guaranty or of Guarantor), as the case may be, with respect  to,  and
this Guaranty shall apply to, any and all amounts so refunded by Seller  or 
paid by Seller to another person (which amounts shall constitute part of 
the  Guaranteed Obligations), and any interest paid by Seller and any
attorneys' fees, costs and expenses paid or incurred by Seller in connection
with  any such  event. It is the intent of Guarantor and Seller that the
obligations and  liabilities of Guarantor hereunder are absolute and
unconditional under  any and  all circumstances and that until the
Guaranteed Obligations are fully and  finally paid and performed, and not
subject to refund or disgorgement,  the  obligations and liabilities of
Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged  or  released, in whole or in
part, by any act or occurrence that might, but  for the  provisions of this
Guaranty, be deemed a legal or equitable discharge or  release  of
Guarantor.

 

 



 

In  addition to the other matters set forth in this _Section  4_ , 
Guarantor hereby waives any claim of subrogation with respect to any payment 
made by Guarantor to Seller arising out of the Guaranteed Obligations until 
all  Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full.

 



 

**Section ** **5** **.** **_Seller  Assigns_**.  This  Guaranty is for the
benefit of Seller and Seller's successors and assigns in the  event of a
permitted assignment of, and under the terms of, the PA,  or any  part
thereof, and the rights and benefits hereunder, to the extent applicable 
to  the PA  so  assigned, may be transferred with such Guaranteed
Obligations. Seller shall  provide notice of any transfer or assignment of
the PA,  or any  part thereof, to Guarantor, provided that failure to give
such notice will  not  affect the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder unless
such failure to provide  notice precludes Guarantor from performing its
obligations under this  Guaranty.

 



 

**Section  6.** **_Binding  Effect_**.  This  Guaranty is binding not only
on Guarantor, but also on Guarantor's successors  and assigns.

 



 

**Section  7.** **_Governing  Law; Forum_**.  This  Guaranty, and its
validity, enforcement, and interpretation, shall for all  purposes be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the  State  of New
York without  regard to the conflicts of laws provisions of the State of New
York that  would  result in the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction,  except  as superseded by the Bankruptcy Code and applicable
United States federal  law,  and is intended to be performed in accordance
with, and only to the extent  permitted by, such laws. All obligations of
Guarantor hereunder are payable  and  performable at the place or places
where the Guaranteed Obligations are payable  and performable. Guarantor
hereby irrevocably submits generally and  unconditionally for Guarantor and
in respect of Guarantor's property to the  jurisdiction of the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District  of  New York over any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to  this  Guaranty or the
Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives,  to  the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that Guarantor may now  or 
hereafter have to the laying of venue in any such court and any claim that 
any  such court is an inconvenient forum. Guarantor

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

hereby  agrees and consents that, in addition to any methods of service of
process  provided for under applicable law, all service of process in any
such suit,  action or proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Southern  District of New York may be made by certified or registered
mail, return  receipt  requested, directed to Guarantor at its address
stated in _Section  11_   of this  Guaranty, or at a subsequent address of
which Seller received actual notice  from  Guarantor in accordance with the
notice provisions hereof, and service so  made  shall be complete five (5)
days after the same shall have been so mailed.  Nothing herein shall affect
the right of Seller to serve process in any manner  permitted by law or limit
the right of Seller to bring proceedings against  Guarantor in any other
court or jurisdiction.

 

 

**Section  8.** **_Attorneys '  Fees and Costs of Collection_**.  Guarantor
shall pay on demand all reasonable attorneys' fees actually incurred  and all
other costs and expenses actually incurred by Seller in the enforcement  of
or preservation of Seller's rights under this Guaranty. Guarantor agrees to 
pay interest on any expenses or other sums due to Seller under this _Section 
8_   that are  not paid when due, at a rate per annum equal to the prime
rate as stated  in the  Wall Street Journal plus two percent (2%).
Guarantor's obligations and  liabilities under this _Section  8_   shall 
survive any payment or discharge in full of the Guaranteed  Obligations.

 



 

**Section  9.** **_Payments_**.  All  sums payable under this Guaranty
shall be paid in immediately available funds  in  lawful money of the United
States of America that at the time of payment  is  legal tender for the
payment of public and private debts.

 



 

**Section  10.** **_Notices_**.  All  notices, requests, waivers,
approvals, consents and demands to or upon the  respective parties hereto,
and all responses thereto, shall be in writing  and  shall be deemed to have
been properly given or served when personally delivered  or deposited in the
mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, postage  prepaid, or
delivered to a nationally recognized overnight courier service  (e.g.,
Federal Express) which maintains evidence of receipt, with all delivery 
charges paid or provided for, addressed to the addresses set forth below. 
All  notices, requests and demands, and all responses thereto, shall be
effective  (i)  upon receipt if personally delivered (ii) one (1) business
day after deposit  if  sent by overnight courier or (iii) three (3) business
days after deposit  in the  mail, if mailed as referenced above. Rejection
or other refusal to accept  or the  inability to deliver because of changed
address of which no notice was given  shall be deemed to be receipt of the
notice, demand or request sent. To the  extent reasonably possible, the
parties shall provide written notice at least  thirty (30) days prior to any
change of their respective addresses. Neither  party may have more than three
(3) addresses. For the purpose of this Guaranty  the following addresses

condition of this Guaranty, or the application  of such term, covenant or
condition, to any party or circumstance shall be  found  by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be, to any extent, invalid or  unenforceable, the

condition to parties or circumstances other than those to which  it  is held
invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each  term, 
covenant or condition shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent

as Guarantor, in which case Guarantor shall be released  from its obligations
under this Guaranty to the extent such obligations are  assumed by the
assignee.
