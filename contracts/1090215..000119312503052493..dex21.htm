-vi- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of September
21, 2003, is entered into by and among Bookham Technology plc, a public
limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the
"Parent"), Budapest Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Parent (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), and New Focus,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").



WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Parent and the Company deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and their respective
stockholders that the Parent combine with the Company in order to advance the
long-term business interests of the Parent and the Company;



WHEREAS, the business combination of the Company shall be effected through a
merger (the "Merger") of the Transitory Subsidiary into the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), as a result of which the Company shall
become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent;



WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as
a condition and inducement to the Parents willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the stockholders of the Company listed on _Schedule A_ have entered
into Stockholder Agreements, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "Company Stockholder Agreements"),
pursuant to which such stockholders have, among other things, agreed to give
the Parent a proxy to vote all of the shares of capital stock of the Company
that such stockholders own;



WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and as a condition and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into
this Agreement, the shareholders of the Parent listed on _Schedule B_ have
entered into Shareholder Agreements, dated as of the date of this Agreement,
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "Parent Shareholder
Agreements"), pursuant to which such shareholders have, among other things,
agreed to give the Company a proxy to vote all of the shares of capital stock
of the Parent that such shareholders own;



WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"); and



WHEREAS, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company intends
to distribute the Cash Amount (as defined herein) to the holders of Company
Common Stock outstanding on the Distribution Record Date, as defined below
(the "Distribution").



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Parent, the Transitory Subsidiary and the
Company agree as follows: ARTICLE I



 

THE MERGER



1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Parent shall prepare, and on the
Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter the Parent shall cause to
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate
of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by, and
executed by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as is established by the Parent and the Company and set
forth in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").



1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Parent and the
Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second business
day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall
remain subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Wilson, Sonsini,
Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto,
California, unless another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the
Parent and the Company.



1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (i) the separate existence
of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Transitory Subsidiary shall
be merged with and into the Company (the Company following the Merger is
sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation"), (ii) the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement shall be amended so that Article FOURTH of such Certificate of
Incorporation reads in its entirety as follows: "The total number of shares
of all classes of stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is
1,000, all of which shall consist of common stock, $.01 par value per share,"
and, as so amended, such Certificate of Incorporation shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until further
amended in accordance with the DGCL, and (iii) the directors and officers of
the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation. In addition, the Parent shall cause the By-laws of the
Company to be amended and restated in their entirety immediately following
the Effective Time so that they are identical to the By-laws of the Transitory
Subsidiary as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
all references to the name of the Transitory Subsidiary therein shall be
changed to refer to the name of the Company, and, as so amended and restated,
such By-laws shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until further
amended in accordance with the DGCL and such By-laws. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.



 

-2- ARTICLE II



 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES AND

DISTRIBUTION OF THE CASH AMOUNT



2.1  _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory
Subsidiary:



(a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_. Each share of the common
stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, US $.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
common stock, US $0.001 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock or by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the
Parent, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no stock of the Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.



(c)  _Exchange Ratio for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2, each
share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance
with Section 2.1(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be automatically converted into and represent the right to receive
1.2015 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Parent American Depositary Shares
("Parent ADSs"), each Parent ADS representing one ordinary share, par value
1/3 p per share, of the Parent ("Parent Ordinary Shares") or, at the election
of the holder of Company Common Stock, the equivalent number of Parent
Ordinary Shares in registered certificated or uncertificated form, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock
in the manner provided in Section 2.2; _provided_ that if a holder of Company
Common Stock does not make such election on the letter of transmittal
forwarded to such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(b), such holder shall be
deemed to have elected to receive Parent ADSs. The Parent ADSs shall be
evidenced by one or more American Depository Receipts ("Parent ADRs") issued
in accordance with the Deposit Agreement dated as of April 11, 2000 by and
among the Parent, The Bank of New York (the "Depository") and the holders from
time to time of Parent ADRs (the "Deposit Agreement"). As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Parent ADSs pursuant to this Section 2.1(c), any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent ADSs to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest. For purposes of this Agreement, references to Parent ADSs shall also
mean Parent Ordinary Shares that holders of Company Common Stock may elect to
receive in lieu of Parent ADSs pursuant to the Merger.



 

-3- (d) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, consolidation,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent ADSs or Company
Common Stock), reorganization, capital redemption or repayment, bonus issue,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares,
Parent ADSs or Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is
established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, other
than the Distribution.



(e) _Unvested Stock_. At the Effective Time, any Parent ADSs issued in
accordance with Section 2.1(c) with respect to any unvested shares of Company
Common Stock awarded to employees, directors or consultants pursuant to any of
the Companys plans or arrangements and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain subject to the same terms, restrictions and
vesting schedule as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
to the extent by their terms as in effect as of the date hereof such unvested
shares of Company Common Stock vest at the Effective Time. The Company shall
not take or permit any action, which would accelerate vesting of any unvested
shares, except to the extent required by their terms as in effect on the date
hereof. Copies of the relevant agreements governing such shares and the
vesting thereof have been provided to the Parent. All outstanding rights which
the Company may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to
repurchase unvested shares of Company Common Stock shall be assigned to the
Parent in the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by the Surviving
Corporation upon the same terms and conditions in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that the shares purchasable and the purchase price
payable per share pursuant to such rights shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall take all steps necessary to
cause the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.1(e) to occur.



(f) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. Following the Effective Time,
Company Stock Options shall be treated in the manner set forth in Section
6.13.



2.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Distribution of Cash Amount_. The procedures
for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for Parent ADSs
pursuant to the Merger and the Distribution of the Cash Amount are as follows:



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, the Parent shall deposit with
the Depository, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, the number of Parent Ordinary Shares as are represented by the Parent
ADSs to be issued in connection with Section 2.1. In addition, as of the
Effective Time, the Depository shall deposit with Capita plc or another bank
or trust company designated by the Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2,
through the Exchange Agent, Parent ADSs (such Parent ADSs, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares
underlying such Parent ADSs with a record date after the Effective Time, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section
2.1 in exchange for certificates evidencing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding as of the Effective Time ("Certificates"). At the Effective Time,
the Parent shall also deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance



 

-4- with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent cash in an amount sufficient
to make payments for fractional shares required pursuant to Section 2.2(e).



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable and in any event
within ten (10) business days after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall (A) include a form of election by which
each such holder may elect to receive the merger consideration to which such
holder is entitled in the form of Parent ADSs or Parent Ordinary Shares in
registered form and (B) specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as the Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
Parent ADRs (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Parent ADSs
and any dividends or distributions as provided below) or certificates
representing Parent Ordinary Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by the Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a Parent ADR representing that number of whole Parent ADSs
or a certificate representing that number of Parent Ordinary Shares
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e)
and any dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a Parent ADR representing
the proper number of Parent ADSs or a certificate representing the proper
number of Parent Ordinary Shares issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to
this Article II plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and any dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) may be issued or paid to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate
is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Parent
ADR representing Parent ADSs or certificates representing Parent Ordinary
Shares plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
any dividends or distributions then payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) as
contemplated by this Section 2.2.



(c)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent ADSs with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder of record of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
issued and paid to the record holder of the Certificate, at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole Parent
ADSs, without interest, and, at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions having a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender that are
payable with respect to such whole Parent ADSs.



 

-5- (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Parent ADSs
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash or dividends or other distributions paid
pursuant to Sections

2.2(c) or 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.



(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No Parent ADRs or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent ADSs, or if applicable certificates representing Parent
Ordinary Shares, shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of the Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent ADS (after taking into
account all Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of
a Parent ADS multiplied by the average of the last reported sales prices of
Parent ADSs at the 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, end of regular trading hours on
The NASDAQ Stock Market during the ten consecutive trading days ending on the
last trading day prior to the Effective Time.



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for 12
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Parent, upon
demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied
with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Parent, as a general
unsecured creditor, for payment of its claim for Parent ADSs, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent ADSs and any dividends or distributions
with respect to Parent ADSs.



(g) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Parent, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock, Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs, as the case may be, for such
shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date that is 18 months after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which any Parent ADSs and any cash payable to the holder of
such Certificate or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of
such Certificate pursuant to this Article II would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Parent ADSs and the
underlying Parent Ordinary Shares, or cash, dividends or distributions in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto.



 

-6- (h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, each of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the payments to be made pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payments under the
Code or any other applicable provision of law and to collect Forms W-8 or W-9,
as applicable, or similar information from the holders of Company Common Stock
and any other recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be.



(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Parent ADSs and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on Parent Ordinary Shares
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.



(j) _Distribution of the Cash Amount_. Subject to the provisions of Section
6.22, (A) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver the Cash
Amount to EquiServe and (B) immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall effect the Distribution and EquiServe shall deliver to each
holder of Company Common Stock on the Distribution Record Date, a check in the
amount of the Cash Amount Per Share. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
following terms shall have the following meanings:



(i) "Cash Amount" shall equal the product of (A) the Cash Amount Per Share
and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as
of the Distribution Record Date.



(ii) "Cash Amount Per Share" shall equal US $2.19.



(iii) "Distribution Record Date" means the close of business on the date to be
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company as the record date for
determining stockholders of the Company entitled to receive a share of the
Distribution.



ARTICLE III



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



The Company represents and warrants to the Parent and the Transitory
Subsidiary that the statements contained in this Article III are true and
correct, except as expressly set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule
delivered by the Company to the Parent and the Transitory Subsidiary on or
before the date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). The
Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to
the numbered



 

-7- and lettered paragraphs contained in this Article III and the disclosure in
any paragraph shall qualify (1) the corresponding paragraph in this Article
III and (2) the other paragraphs in this Article III only to the extent such
disclosure reasonably appears on its face to be applicable to such other
paragraphs.



3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries_.



(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and, where applicable as a legal concept, in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted and
as proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction listed in Section
3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, which jurisdictions constitute the
only jurisdictions in which the character of the properties it owns, operates
or leases or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary,
except for such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, that have not had a Company Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse
Effect" means any material adverse change, event, circumstance or development
with respect to, or material adverse effect on (i) the business, assets,
liabilities, capitalization, financial condition, or results of operations of

Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clause (i), in no event shall any
of the following, alone or in combination, be deemed to constitute, nor shall
any of the following be taken into account in determining whether there has
occurred, a Company Material Adverse Effect: any adverse change, event,
circumstance or development with respect to, or effect resulting from (A)
general economic conditions or conditions generally affecting the
semiconductor capital equipment and the test and measurement industries,
except to the extent the Company is materially disproportionately affected
thereby, (B) the announcement or pendency of the Merger or any
other transactions expressly contemplated hereby, (C) compliance with the
express terms and conditions of this Agreement, (D) a change in the stock
price or trading volume of the Company (or any failure of the Company to meet
published revenue or earnings projections), _provided_ that clause (D) shall
not exclude any underlying effect which may have caused such change in stock
price or trading volume or failure to meet published revenue or earnings
projections, (E) any change in accounting requirements or principles or any
change in applicable laws, rules or regulations or the interpretation thereof
or (F) the continued incurrence of losses by the Company. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties agree that the terms "material", "materially" or
"materiality" as used in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m" shall
have their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard to the
meanings ascribed to Company Material Adverse Effect in the prior sentence of
this paragraph or Parent Material Adverse Effect in Section 4.1.

partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other business
association or entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which (i)

one or more of its Subsidiaries holds voting power to elect a majority of the

indirectly, owns or controls more than 50% of the equity, membership,
partnership or similar interests.



(c) The Company has timely paid in its capital contribution to the registered
capital of the Companys subsidiaries in The Peoples Republic of China (the
"PRC") as such capital contributions have become due.



(d) The Company has delivered to the Parent complete and accurate copies of

(a) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, and except for normal and recurring liabilities incurred since
the date of the Company Balance Sheet in the Ordinary Course of Business, the
Company and its Subsidiaries



 

-14- do not have any material liabilities, either accrued, contingent or otherwise
(whether or not required to be reflected in financial statements in
accordance with GAAP), and whether due or to become due.



(b) Section 3.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all loan or credit
agreements, notes, bonds, mortgages, indentures and other agreements and
instruments (i) pursuant to which any indebtedness of the Company or any of

outstanding thereunder as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) which creates
or governs all securitization and "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act). For purposes of this
Section, "indebtedness" means, with respect to any person, without
duplication, (A) all obligations of such person for borrowed money, or with
respect to deposits or advances of any kind to such person, (B) all
obligations of such person evidenced by bonds, debentures, notes or similar
instruments, (C) all obligations of such person upon which interest charges
are customarily paid, (D) all obligations of such person under conditional
sale or other title retention agreements relating to property purchased by

and each of its Subsidiaries may be prepaid by the Company or its Subsidiary
at any time without the consent or approval of, or prior notice to, any other
person, and without payment of any premium or penalty.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all material Tax
Returns that it was required to file, and all such Tax Returns were correct

not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have paid on a timely basis all Taxes that are shown to be



 

-15- due on any such Tax Returns. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for Tax periods through the date of the Company Balance Sheet do
not exceed the accruals and reserves for Taxes set forth on the Company
Balance Sheet exclusive of any accruals and reserves for "deferred taxes" or
similar items that reflect timing differences between Tax and financial
accounting principles. All Taxes attributable to the period from and after the

Ordinary Course of Business and are consistent both as to type and amount
with Taxes attributable to such comparable period in the immediately preceding
year. All Taxes that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was required
by law to withhold or collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to
the extent required, have been paid to the proper Governmental Entity. For

imposts, levies or other similar assessments or liabilities, including
income, gross receipts, ad valorem, premium, value-added, excise, real
property, personal property, sales, use, services, transfer, withholding,

United States or any such government, and any interest, fines, penalties,
assessments or additions to tax resulting from, attributable to or incurred
in connection with any tax or any contest or dispute thereof and (ii) "Tax
Returns" means all reports, returns, declarations, statements or other
information required to be supplied to a taxing authority in connection with

year specified in Section 3.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. No
examination, audit or other dispute with respect to any material Tax Return of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity is currently
in progress or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or contemplated.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed by any
Governmental Entity that the Governmental Entity believes that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries was required to file any material Tax Return that was
not filed. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any

with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

actual or potential liability for any Taxes of any person (other than the

under Section 4999 of the Code as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement for which the Company or the Parent may directly or

Section 280G of the Code as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

property that is required to be treated as being owned by any other person

otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that includes the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns any interest in an entity that
is characterized as a partnership for United States federal income Tax
purposes.

real property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Real

of all applicable building, zoning, subdivision, health, safety,
environmental, pollution control, waste products, sewage control and all other
applicable statutes, laws, codes, ordinances, rules, orders and
regulations (collectively, "Governmental Regulations"). There is no material
action pending or threatened by any Governmental Entity claiming that the Real
Estate violates any Governmental Regulations or threatening to shut down the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no suits,
petitions, notices or proceedings pending, given or, to the Companys
knowledge, threatened against the Company by any persons or Governmental
Entities before any court, Governmental Entity or instrumentalities,
administrative or otherwise, which if given, commenced or concluded would have
a material adverse effect on the Companys title to the Real Estate or the

whole, as presently operated.



(c) All of the buildings, fixtures and other improvements located on the Real

enforceable in accordance with its terms and shall not cease to be in full
force and effect as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries leases, subleases
or licenses any real property to any person other than the Company and its

Subsidiaries as currently conducted, or that would be used or necessary as
such business is planned to be conducted (in each case excluding generally
commercially available, off-the-shelf software programs licensed pursuant to

Subsidiary.



(b) With respect to each Company Employee Plan, the Company has furnished
to the Parent a complete and accurate copy of (i) such Company Employee Plan
(or a  



 

-23-  written summary of any unwritten plan), (ii) the three (3) most recent
annual reports, if any, (Form 5500 and all required schedules and
financial statements) filed with the United States Internal Revenue Service,
(iii) each trust agreement, group annuity contract and summary plan
description, if any, relating to such Company Employee Plan, (iv) the most
recent financial statements for each Company Employee Plan that is funded,
(v) all personnel, payroll and employment manuals and policies, (vi) all

Code, if applicable, (viii) all Internal Revenue Service determination,
opinion, notification and advisory letters with respect to any Company
Employee Plan and (ix) all material correspondence to or from any governmental
agency relating to any Company Employee Plan.



(c) Each Company Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws and the
regulations thereunder and in accordance with its terms and each of the
Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their ERISA Affiliates has in all
material respects met its obligations with respect to such Company Employee
Plan and has made all required contributions thereto (or reserved such
contributions on the Company Balance Sheet) on time. The Company, each
Subsidiary of the Company, each ERISA Affiliate and each Company Employee Plan
are in compliance in all material respects with the currently applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code and the regulations thereunder (including
Section 4980B of the Code, Subtitle K; Chapter 100 of the Code and Sections
601 through 608 and Section 701 _et seq_. of ERISA). All filings and reports
as to each Company Employee Plan required to have been submitted to the
Internal Revenue Service or to the United States Department of Labor have
been timely submitted. With respect to the Company Employee Plans, no event
has occurred, and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in
connection with which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate could be subject to any material liability under ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable law. There are no audits, inquiries or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by the
Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor or any other person.



(d) With respect to the Company Employee Plans, there are no benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and
there are no benefit obligations, which have not been accounted for by
reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP, on the
financial statements of the Company. The assets of each Company Employee Plan,
which is funded, are reported at their fair market value on the books and
records of such Company Employee Plan.



(e) All the Company Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination letters from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company Employee Plans are
qualified and the plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from federal
income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, no
such determination letter has been revoked and, to the Companys knowledge,
revocation has not been threatened, and no such Employee Benefit Plan has been
amended or operated since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that
would adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its cost. Each
Company Employee Plan which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or
Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested (if required to be tested) for



 

-24-  compliance with, and satisfies the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and
Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for each plan year ending
prior to the Closing Date.



(f) Neither the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries nor any of their
ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever maintained a Company Employee Plan which was
ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been
obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Company Employee Plan is funded by, associated with
or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. Any Company Employee Plan that
holds securities issued by the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
any of their ERISA Affiliates is identified as such on Schedule 3.13(f). No
Company Employee Plan provides health benefits that are not fully insured
through an insurance contract.



(g) Each Company Employee Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by
the Company and any of the Companys Subsidiaries which are a party thereto or
covered thereby at any time without liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result thereof (other than for benefits accrued through the
date of termination or amendment and reasonable administrative expenses
related thereto) and no Company Employee Plan, plan documentation or
agreement, summary plan description or other written communication
distributed generally to employees by its terms prohibits the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such Company Employee
Plan. The investment vehicles used to fund the Company Employee Plans may
be changed at any time without incurring a material sales charge, surrender
fee or other similar expense.



(h) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any oral or written (i) agreement with any stockholders, director, executive
officer or other key employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (A)
the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are materially
altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of the nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee or
(C) providing severance benefits or other benefits after the termination of
employment of such director, executive officer or key employee or (ii)
agreement or plan binding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including
any stock option plan, stock appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan,
stock purchase plan or severance benefit plan, any of the benefits of which
shall be increased, or the vesting of the benefits of which shall be
accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which shall be
calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(i) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as required
by applicable law.



(j) Schedule 3.13(j) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all Company
Employee Plans maintained outside the United States (each, a "Non-U.S. Plan").

are maintained in material compliance with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations of each jurisdiction in which such Non-U.S. Plan is maintained.

Company Material Adverse Effect.



3.15 _Permits_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all permits,
licenses and franchises from Governmental Entities required to conduct their

Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in

Company is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable foreign,
federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations respecting employment,
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours,
in each case, with respect to its current or former employees.



(b) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement, no employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i)
has an employment agreement, (ii) to the Companys knowledge is in violation
of any term of any patent disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or
any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any
such employee to be employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries because
of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to the use of trade secrets or
proprietary information of

to do so or not to renew any such policy.



3.18 [Intentionally Omitted]



3.19 _Assets_. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns or leases all

Liens that, individually and in the aggregate, do not materially interfere
with the ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries to conduct their business

ARTICLE IV



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT AND THE

TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY



The Parent and the Transitory Subsidiary represent and warrant to the Company
that the statements contained in this Article IV are true and correct, except
as expressly set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Parent and the Transitory Subsidiary to the Company on or before the date of
this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule"). The Parent Disclosure
Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered paragraphs contained in this Article IV and the disclosure in any
paragraph shall qualify (1) the corresponding paragraph in this Article IV and
(2) the other paragraphs in this Article IV only to the extent such disclosure
reasonably appears on its face to be applicable to such other paragraphs.



4.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.



(a) Each of the Parent and the Transitory Subsidiary is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and, where applicable as a legal concept, in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted and
as proposed to be conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which
the character of the properties it owns, operates or leases or the nature of
its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for such failures to
be so organized, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, that have not had a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any
material adverse change, event, circumstance or development with respect to,
or material adverse effect on (i) the business, assets, liabilities,
capitalization, financial condition, or results of operations of the Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the ability of the Parent or
the Transitory Subsidiary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clause (i), in no
event shall any of the following, alone or in combination, be deemed to
constitute, nor shall any of the following be taken into account
in determining whether there has occurred, a Parent Material Adverse Effect:
any adverse change, event, circumstance or development with respect to, or
effect resulting from (A) general economic conditions or conditions generally
affecting the optical networking industry, except in either case to the
extent the Parent is materially disproportionately affected thereby, (B) the
announcement or pendency of the Merger or any other transactions expressly
contemplated hereby, (C) compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (D) a change in the stock price or trading volume of the Parent
Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs (or any failure of the Parent to meet published
revenue or earnings projections), _provided_ that clause (D) shall not
exclude any underlying effect which may have caused such change in stock price
or trading volume or failure to meet published revenue or earnings
projections, (E) any change in accounting requirements or principles or any  



 

-29-  change in applicable laws, rules or regulations or the interpretation
thereof or (F) the continued incurrence of losses by the Parent. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the terms "material", "materially"
or "materiality" as used in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m"
shall have their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard
to the meanings ascribed to Parent Material Adverse Effect in the prior
sentence of this paragraph or Company Material Adverse Effect in Section
3.1(a). The Parent has delivered to the Company complete and accurate copies
of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Parent together with
copies of all shareholder resolutions required by law to be embodied in or
annexed thereto.

directly or indirectly owns any equity, membership, partnership or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for any equity, membership, partnership or similar interest in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other
business association or entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated, and

partnership, limited liability company or other entity.

were issued and outstanding. No material change in such capitalization has
occurred between September 19, 2003 and the date of this Agreement.



(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list, as of the date of this Agreement, of: (i) all
share option plans or other share or equity-related plans of the Parent (the

Parent Ordinary Shares and/or Parent ADSs issued to date under such Plan, the
number of Parent Ordinary Shares and/or Parent ADSs subject to outstanding

the time filed, were or will be prepared in  



 

-32-  compliance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules

not or will not at the time they were or are filed contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated in such Parent SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the statements
in such Parent SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Parent is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes and schedules) contained or to be contained in the Parent
SEC Reports at the time filed (i) complied or will comply as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were or will be

and, to the extent applicable and required by the Securities Act or Exchange
Act, reconciled to GAAP and (iii) fairly presented or will fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Parent and
its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, consistent with the books
and records of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, except that the unaudited
interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected to be material in
amount. The consolidated, unaudited balance sheet of the Parent as of June 30,
2003 is referred to herein as the "Parent Balance Sheet." 



(c) The information in the Registration Statement to be supplied by or on
behalf of the Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Registration Statement or to be included or supplied by or on behalf of the
Parent for inclusion in any Regulation M-A Filing shall not at the time
the Registration Statement or any such Regulation M-A Filing is filed with
the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented, or at the time the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, as applicable,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading. The information to be supplied by or on
behalf of the Parent for inclusion in (i) the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus (which shall be deemed to include all information
about or relating to the Parent, the Parent Voting Proposal and the Parent
Shareholders Meeting) and (ii) the Parent UK Documents, to be sent to the
shareholders of the Parent in connection with the Parent Shareholders Meeting
to consider the Parent Voting Proposal, shall not, on the date the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to stockholders of the Company or the
Parent UK Documents are first mailed to the shareholders of the Parent, or at

Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time
and in light of the circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or

Shareholders Meeting which has become false or misleading. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any fact or event relating to the Parent or any
of its Affiliates which should be set forth in an amendment to the
Registration Statement or a supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Parent UK Documents, should be discovered by the Parent or should
occur, the Parent shall promptly inform the Company of such fact or event.



(d) The Parent has in all material respects complied with its obligations to
notify a Regulatory Information Service of information pursuant to the Listing
Rules (the "Listing Rules") of the Financial Services Authority acting in its
capacity as the competent authority for listing in the United Kingdom (the
"UKLA") under Part VI of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA")
since January 1, 2000, and such notifications are publicly available. The
Parent has not received notice from the UKLA that there are any circumstances
and, as of the date of this Agreement, the Parent is not aware of any
circumstances that would justify or warrant the UKLA commencing proceedings
to withdraw or cancel of the listing of the Parent Ordinary Shares by the
UKLA.



4.5 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, and except for normal
and recurring liabilities incurred since the date of the Parent Balance Sheet
in the Ordinary Course of Business, the Parent and its Subsidiaries do not
have any material liabilities, either accrued, contingent or otherwise
(whether or not required to be reflected in financial statements in
accordance with UK GAAP), and whether due or to become due.



4.6 _Agreements, Contracts and Commitments; Government Contracts_.



(a) The Parent has made available to the Company a complete and accurate copy
of each contract and agreement that is material to the business, assets,
liabilities, capitalization, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of
operations of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (the "Parent
Material Contracts"). Each Parent Material Contract is in full force and
effect and is enforceable in accordance with its terms against the Company or
the applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception. To the Parents knowledge, each Parent Material Contract is
enforceable against each other party thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
Parents knowledge, any other party to any Parent Material Contract is in
violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any condition which,
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both, would cause such a
violation of or default under) (x) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, permit, concession, franchise, license or other
contract, arrangement or understanding to which it is a party or by which it
or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for violations or defaults
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and are not reasonably
likely to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (y) any Parent Material
Contract.



(b) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has been suspended or
debarred from bidding on contracts or subcontracts with any
Governmental Entity; no such  



 

-34-  suspension or debarment has been initiated or, to the Parents knowledge,
threatened; and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not result in any such suspension or debarment that,
individually or in the aggregate, would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any agreements, contracts
or commitments, which require it to obtain or maintain a security clearance
with any Governmental Entity.



4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in the Parent
SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since the date of the
Parent Balance Sheet, there has not been (i) any event, change, circumstance,
development or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any other
action or event that would have required the consent of the Company pursuant
to Section 5.2 of this Agreement had such action or event occurred after the
date of this Agreement.



4.8 _Litigation; Product Liability_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, there is no action, suit,
proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending or, to the knowledge
of the Parent, threatened against or affecting the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably
likely to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There are no material
judgments, orders or decrees outstanding against the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. No material product liability claims have been asserted or, to
the knowledge of the Parent, threatened against the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any Parent Products.



4.9 _Intellectual Property._



(a) The Parent and its Subsidiaries exclusively own, or license or otherwise
possess legally enforceable rights to use, without any obligation to make any
fixed or contingent payments, including any royalty payments, all
Intellectual Property used or necessary to conduct the business of the Parent
and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, or that would be used or
necessary as such business is planned to be conducted (in each case excluding
generally commercially available, off-the-shelf software programs licensed
pursuant to shrinkwrap or "click-and-accept" licenses), the absence of which,
individually or in the aggregate would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and consummation of
the Merger will not result in the breach of, or create on behalf of any third
party the right to terminate or modify, (i) Parent Intellectual Property or
(ii) any license, sublicense and other agreement as to which the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is authorized to use any third party Intellectual Property that
is material to the business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, including software that is used in the manufacture of, incorporated
in, or forms a part of any product or service sold by or expected to be sold
by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Parent Third Party Intellectual
Property"). Section 4.9(b)(i) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list, as of the date hereof, of the Parent Intellectual
Property (other than unregistered copyrights, trade secrets and confidential
information) and Section 4.9(b)(ii) sets forth a complete and accurate list
of all Third Party Intellectual Property. Neither the Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has transferred ownership of, or granted any exclusive license of
or right to use,  



 

-35-  or authorized the retention of any exclusive rights to use or joint
ownership of, any Intellectual Property this is or was Parent Intellectual
Property, to any other person.



(c) All patents and registrations and applications for trademarks, service
marks and copyrights which are held by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
and which are material to the business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, are, to Parents knowledge, valid and subsisting. The
Parent and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to protect the
proprietary nature of the Parent Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of
the Parent, no other person or entity is infringing, violating or
misappropriating any of the Parent Intellectual Property or Third Party
Intellectual Property, except for infringements, violations or
misappropriations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.



(d) None of the (i) Parent Products or (ii) business or activities
previously or currently conducted by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
infringes, violates or constitutes a misappropriation of, any Intellectual
Property (other than Patents) of any third party, except for such
infringements, violations and misappropriation that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. With respect to
Patents, to the knowledge of Parent and its Subsidiaries, none of the (i)
Parent Products or (ii) business as currently conducted by the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries infringes, violates or constitutes a misappropriation of,
any Patents of any third party, except for such infringements, violations and
misappropriation that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any complaint, claim or notice alleging any such infringement,
violation or misappropriation of Intellectual Property of a third party. 



(e) For purposes of this Section, "Parent Products" means the product and or
services sold, leased, licensed or provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries
currently or at any time during the immediately preceding seven years.



4.10 _Taxes_.



(a) The Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all material Tax Returns
that it was required to file, and all such Tax Returns were correct
and complete except for any errors or omissions that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as would
not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries have paid on a timely basis all Taxes that are due. The unpaid
Taxes of the Parent and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods through the date of
the Parent Balance Sheet do not exceed the accruals and reserves for Taxes set
forth on the Parent Balance Sheet exclusive of any accruals and reserves for
"deferred taxes" or similar items that reflect timing differences between Tax
and financial accounting principles. All Taxes attributable to the period from
and after the date of the Parent Balance Sheet and continuing through the
Closing Date are attributable to the conduct by the Parent and its
Subsidiaries of operations in the Ordinary Course of Business and are
consistent both as to type and amount with Taxes attributable to such
comparable periods in the immediately preceding year. All Taxes that the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or was required by law to withhold or
collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have
been paid to the proper Governmental Entity.



 

-36- (b) The income Tax Returns of the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have
been audited by the applicable Governmental Entity or are closed by the
applicable statute of limitations for all taxable years through the taxable
year specified in Section 4.10(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule. No
examination, audit or other dispute with respect to any material Tax Return
of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity is
currently in progress or, to the knowledge of the Parent, threatened or
contemplated. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed
by any Governmental Entity that the Governmental Entity believes that the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was
not filed. Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any
statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to an extension of
time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

actual or potential liability for any Taxes of any person (other than the

a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax allocation
agreement.



(f) There are no material adjustments under Section 481 of the Code (or any
similar adjustments under any provision of the Code or any
corresponding foreign, state or local Tax laws) that are required (or will be
required as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to be
taken into account by the Parent or any Subsidiary in any period ending after
the Closing Date by reason of a change in method of accounting in any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date.



(g) Neither the Parent nor any Subsidiary has distributed to its stockholders
or security holders stock or securities of a controlled corporation, nor
has stock or securities of the Parent or any Subsidiary been distributed, in
a transaction to which Section 355 of the Code  



 

-37-  applies (i) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in

related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that
includes the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.11 _Environmental Matters_.



(a) Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement, each of the Parent and its Subsidiaries has complied with
all applicable Environmental Laws, except for violations of Environmental Laws
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Parent,
threatened civil or criminal litigation, written notice of violation, formal
administrative proceeding, or investigation, inquiry or information request by
any Governmental Entity, relating to any Environmental Law involving the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

which they are presently used.

firm or person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any action, agreement

Company Acquisition Proposal is not pending, and, in either such case, so long
as at the time of such termination the Company is not in breach of a

allotment and the Parent ADSs, and in the case of The NASDAQ Stock Market,
subject to official notice of issuance.



6.13 _Company Stock Plans_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option under the
Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall, as part of the
Merger, be assumed by the Parent and each Company Stock Option shall be
deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a number of units equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying each such option. The exercise price for each such
unit shall equal the per share exercise price of the applicable Company Stock
Option. A unit shall be comprised of (i) 1.2015 Parent Ordinary Shares and
(ii) the Cash Amount Per Share. The number of Parent Ordinary Shares issuable

appropriate form with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares subject to such
options and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and

therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.



 

-53- (d) The Company and the Parent acknowledge that the Company ESPP shall
continue to operate in accordance with its terms following the execution of
this Agreement, except as provided below. The Company shall not commence any
Offering (as defined in the Company ESPP) pursuant to the Company ESPP that
will not terminate prior to the Effective Time. Effective as of or prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Company ESPP to terminate in
accordance with Section 20 of the Company ESPP, and no purchase rights shall
be subsequently granted or exercised under the Company ESPP. The Company
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Company ESPP will not be
amended or modified in any respect after the date hereof, except to effect the
terms of this Section 6.13(d).



(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary to amend all outstanding Company Stock Options to include the
Company Stock Plan under which such Company Stock Option was issued as an
exhibit to and as part of such Company Stock Option.



(f) The Company shall take all such action, including the adoption of
any necessary resolutions by the Company Board or any appropriate committee

this Agreement, and shall not settle any such litigation without the Parents
prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.



6.15 _Indemnification_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for a
period of six years from the Effective Time, to honor all of the Companys
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director
and officer of the Company (the "Indemnified Parties"), against any costs or
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the extent that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless exist on the date of this
Agreement.



(b) Without limiting any obligation under 6.15(a), for a period of six years
after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain (to the extent available in the market) in effect a directors and
officers liability insurance policy covering those persons who are currently
covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy
(a complete and accurate copy of which has been delivered to the Parent prior
to the date of this Agreement) with coverage in amount and scope at least as
favorable to such persons as the Companys existing coverage; provided,
however, that in no event shall the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend in excess of one



 

-54-  hundred seventy five percent (175%) of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such coverage, and to the extent the annual premium would
exceed one hundred seventy five percent (175%) of such current annual
premium, the Parent or Surviving Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts
to be maintained the maximum amount of coverage available for such one hundred
seventy five percent (175%) of such current annual premium. The Company
hereby represents that the annual premium currently paid by the Company for
such coverage is US $1,411,618. The Parent and the Surviving Corporation may
meet their obligations under this Section 6.15 by purchasing a "tail" policy
under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy which
(i) has an effective term of six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers
only those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and
officers insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof and only for
actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii)
contains coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policy.



(c) The provisions of this Section 6.15 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of
the Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and their representatives. The obligations of the Company
and Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.15 shall be binding upon their
respective successors and assigns.



6.16 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Parent shall give notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give notice to the Parent, promptly upon any
director or officer of the Parent or Company (as applicable) becoming aware of
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure
to occur would be reasonably likely to cause (a) (i) any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any
material failure of the Parent and the Transitory Subsidiary or the Company,
as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the above, (i) the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation
to consummate the Merger and (ii) any breach of a representation or warranty
by the Parent or the Company, as applicable, that does not itself give rise to
a failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3(a) of
this Agreement, as applicable, shall not give the non-breaching party the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8(h) or Section 8(i) of
this Agreement, as applicable. 



6.17 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. 



(a) The Parent Board, or a committee thereof consisting of non-employee
directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the
Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective Time
providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of Parent Ordinary Shares
represented by Parent ADSs in exchange for shares of  



 

-55-  Company Common Stock, and of options to purchase Parent Ordinary Shares upon

by the Company to the Parent within 10 business days after the date of this
Agreement.



(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Insiders" means those officers
and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as listed in the Section 16 Information.

be elected as directors of the Parent.



6.19 _Service Credit_. Following the Effective Time, the Parent will give
each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries for purposes of (i) eligibility and vesting under any Parent
Employee Benefit Plans and (ii) determination of benefits levels under any
Parent Employee Benefit Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance, in
each case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which
the Continuing Employee is offered participation, but except where such
crediting would (A) result in a duplication of benefits or (B) otherwise
cause the Parent or its Subsidiaries or any Parent Employee Benefit Plan or
trust relating thereto to accrue or pay for benefits that relate to any time
period prior to the Continuing Employees participation in the Parent
Employee Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Parent Employee
Benefit Plan" means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA), any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section

or relating to, any current or former employee of the Company or any of its

employees of Parent and employees of the Transitory Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time who shall have been employees of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

or benefits of its employees.



6.21 _401(k) Plan_. If requested by the Parent by written notice no less than
five (5) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate each
Company Employee Plan that is intended to comply with Section 401(k) of the
Code, effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. If the
Parent provides such notice to the Company, the Company shall provide the
Parent with evidence that all such 401(k) plans have been so terminated
pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to review and reasonable approval of the Parent.
The Company shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such
401(k) plan as the Parent may reasonably require.



6.22 _Distribution_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
in the event that the Parent or the Company determines, in its reasonable
judgment after consultation with outside counsel, the Distribution would
constitute a violation of applicable statutory law, then the Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, shall promptly provide notice thereof to the
other party. The Company and the Parent covenant that they shall thereafter
negotiate in good faith to restructure the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, such that the Company stockholders shall receive
consideration composed of cash and shares corresponding to the consideration
contemplated by the provisions of this Agreement, in conformity with
applicable law and, provided that the conditions set forth in Article VII,
other than the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(h) and 7.2(d), which
shall be deemed to have been satisfied or waived, shall continue to be the
obligations of the parties hereunder pursuant to such restructuring.



6.23 _Transfer Taxes_. The Company shall pay any transfer Taxes (including,
but not limited to, stamp duties, stamp duty reserve taxes, and other similar
taxes) payable in connection with the Merger and shall be responsible for the
preparation and filing of any required Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes.
At and following the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall be jointly

Company and/or Parent in connection with the issuance of Parent ADRs and the
Parent Ordinary Shares to be issued in the Merger and upon the exercise of
Company Stock Options assumed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable for the payment of
any amounts which would cause the Merger to not qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code.

(which includes, without limitation, the making of any representation or
warranty by a party in this Agreement that the party knew was not true and
accurate when made) and (ii) the provisions of Sections 3.25, 5.3 and 8.3 and
Article IX of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, as amended
hereby, shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of
this Agreement.



 

-62- 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.



(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated; provided however, that the Company and the Parent shall
share equally (i) the filing fee of the Parents pre-merger notification
report under the HSR Act and (ii) all fees and expenses, other than
accountants and attorneys fees, incurred with respect to the printing,
filing and mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including
any related preliminary materials), the Parent UK Documents and the
Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto.



(b) The Company shall pay the Parent a termination fee of US $7,000,000 in the
event of the termination of this Agreement:



(i) by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d), in each case,
if, at the time of such termination, the Company is in willful breach of any
of its obligations under Article V or Article VI of this Agreement and such
breach has been the principal cause of the inability to consummate the Merger
or the failure to obtain the requisite vote of the stockholders of the
Company in favor of the Company Voting Proposal;



(ii) by the Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f); or



(iii) by the Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d) if (A) at or
prior to the time of such failure, there shall have been publicly announced
a Company Acquisition Proposal which shall not have been absolutely and
unconditionally withdrawn and abandoned and (B) on or before the date 12
months following the date of such termination of this Agreement, the Company
enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or consummates an
Alternative Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if, at the time of
termination, there is pending a Company Acquisition Proposal that does not
involve a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the Company shall be
permitted to be undertake a complete liquidation or dissolution in lieu of
such Company Acquisition Proposal and, under such circumstances, the Company
shall not be obligated to make any payment of a termination fee to the
Parent under this Section 8.3(b); provided, however, that if a Company
Acquisition Proposal and any liquidation or dissolution are a part of a series
of related transactions, the Company shall be obligated to pay the termination
fee provided for hereunder to the Parent. For the purposes of this Section
8.3(b) only, all references in the definition of "Company Acquisition
Proposal" to "15%" shall be deemed to be references to "30%."



Any fee due under this Section 8.3(b) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-
day funds within one business day after (I) the date of termination of this
Agreement, in the case of a payment pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, or
(II) the earlier of execution of an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or
consummation of an Alternative Acquisition Proposal in the case of a payment
pursuant to clause (iii) above.



(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the Parent would not enter into this
Agreement. If the Company fails to



 

-63-  promptly pay any expense reimbursement or fee due hereunder, the Company
shall pay the costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other
legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on the amount
of any unpaid fee at the publicly announced prime rate of Fleet Bank, N.A.
plus five percent per annum, compounded quarterly, from the date such expense
reimbursement or fee was required to be paid. Payment of the fees and expenses
described in this Section 8.3 shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the
event of a breach of this Agreement described in clause (i) of Section 8.2.



8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of any party, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.



8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or
waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or
condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the
extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights.

delivered at the Closing as well as the Company Stockholder Agreements and the
Parent Shareholder Agreements)



 

-65-  constitutes the entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement and
supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among
the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms.



9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.15, this
Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with
any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.



9.5  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the
Parent and/or the Transitory Subsidiary may assign this Agreement to any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent without consent of
the Company (and the parties hereto shall execute and deliver any amendment to
this Agreement necessary to effect such assignment), provided that the Parent
and/or the Transitory Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall remain liable for
all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.



9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.



9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.



 

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this



 

-66-  Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The language used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties
hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any party. Whenever the context may require, any
pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall
include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any federal, state, local
or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.
Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of
Delaware.



9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.



9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it
shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of
the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto.
Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a
copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section
9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law.



 

-67- 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parent, the Transitory Subsidiary and
the Company hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any
action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or the actions of the Parent, the Transitory Subsidiary
or the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
of this Agreement.
