vi    Execution Copy   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER dated as of May 2, 2002 (the "Agreement") among General
Dynamics Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Parent"), Athena
Acquisition I Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Parent (the "Merger Subsidiary"), and Advanced Technical Products,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").   WHEREAS, the Board of
Directors of each of the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary and the Company deem
it advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies and
stockholders to consummate the merger of the Merger Subsidiary with and into
the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein
(the "Merger"), and have adopted resolutions in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as amended, the "Delaware Act")
approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
herein.   WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, shares of the Company\'s common
stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(as defined below) in the manner set forth herein, and the Company will
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the mutual agreements contained in this Agreement, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the value, receipt and sufficiency of
which are acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1   THE
MERGER   Section 1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3) the
Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into the Company in accordance with
the provisions of the Delaware Act. Following the Merger, the Company will
continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and the
separate corporate existence of the Merger Subsidiary will cease. The Merger
Subsidiary and the Company are sometimes referred to collectively as the
"Constituent Corporations."   Section 1.2 The Closing. Unless this
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date
to be specified by the parties that is no later than the third business day
following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6
(the "Closing Date"), at the offices of Jenner and Block, LLC, 601 13th Street
N.W., Suite 1200S, Washington, D.C., 20006, unless another date, time or
place is agreed to in writing by the parties.     Section 1.3 Effective
Time. Upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date
(or on such other date as the parties may agree) the Company will file with
the Delaware Secretary of State an appropriate certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") in accordance with the Delaware Act. The Merger will
be consummated on the later of the date on which the Certificate of Merger
has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, or such time as is
agreed upon by the parties and specified in such Certificate of Merger. The
time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with the Delaware Act is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time."   Section 1.4 Effects
of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement
and Section 259 of the Delaware Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will succeed
to all the properties, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and assets of
the Constituent Corporations, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Constituent Corporations will become debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   Section 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Merger Subsidiary (as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time),
will become the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their respective
terms and the Delaware Act.   Section 1.6 Directors and Officers. The
directors and the officers of the Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time
will be the initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation and
will hold office from the Effective Time in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.  
Section 1.7 Conversion of Company Common Stock. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of
any shares of Company Stock (as defined in Section 3.2):   (a) Each share
of the Company\'s common stock, par value $0.01 per  share (the "Company
Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective
Time, (other than shares of Company Common Stock to  be canceled pursuant to
(b) below and Dissenting Shares (as defined in (c)  below)) will, by virtue
of the Merger, be converted into the right to  receive, upon the surrender of
the certificate formerly representing such  share in accordance with this
Agreement, $33.50 in cash, without interest  (the "Merger Consideration").
The Company Common Stock includes the  associated rights to purchase Series
RP Preferred Stock of the Company (the  "Rights") issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement dated March 3, 2000,  between the Company and American Stock
Transfer and Trust Company (as  amended, the "Rights    2    Agreement");
all references herein to the Rights will include all benefits  that may inure
to holders of the Rights pursuant to the Rights Agreement  and, unless the
context otherwise requires, all references herein to  Company Common Stock
will include the Rights. All shares of Company Common  Stock when converted,
will no longer be outstanding and will automatically  be canceled and
retired, and each holder of a certificate representing any  such shares will
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the  right to receive
such Merger Consideration. In the event that subsequent to  the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding  shares of Company
Common Stock are changed into a different number of  shares or a different
class as a result of a stock split, reverse stock  split, stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, combination,  exchange, recapitalization or
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration  will be adjusted to reflect
such change.   (b) Each share of Company Common Stock owned immediately
prior to the  Effective Time by the Company, the Merger Subsidiary, the
Parent, or any  Subsidiary (as defined in (d) below) of the Parent or the
Company,  including without limitation, any such shares held as treasury
stock of the  Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, will, by virtue of
the Merger and  without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
canceled and  extinguished without any action on the part of the holder
thereof. For  purposes of this section, shares of Company Common Stock owned
beneficially  or held of record by any plan, program or arrangement sponsored
or  maintained for the benefit of any current or former employee of the 
Company, the Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, will not be 
deemed to be held by the Company, the Parent or any such Subsidiary, 
regardless of whether the Company, the Parent or any such Subsidiary has  the
power, directly or indirectly, to vote or control the disposition of  such
shares.   (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
shares  of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time  and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented  thereto in writing and who has complied with all of the
relevant provisions  of Section 262 of the Delaware Act regarding appraisal
for such shares  ("Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted into a right to
receive the  Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or  otherwise loses their right to appraisal. The Company will give
the Parent  prompt written notice of any and all demands for appraisal
rights,  withdrawal of such demands and any other communications delivered to
the  Company pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware Act, and the Company
will  give the Parent the opportunity, to the extent permitted by law, to 
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such 
demands. Except with the prior written consent of the Parent, the Company 
will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demand for 
appraisal rights and will not settle or offer to settle any such demand. 
Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such 
Dissenting Shares under the provisions of Section 262 of the Delaware Act, 
will receive payment thereof from the Surviving Corporation    3    and
such shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and  will
automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist.   (d) The
term "Subsidiary" as used in this Agreement means any  corporation,
partnership, limited liability company or other business  entity 50% or more
of the outstanding voting equity securities of which are  owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company or the Parent, as applicable.   Section 1.8 Stock
Options. The Company will cause each option, warrant or other right to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Stock Options")
under any option plan, program, agreement or other arrangement of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, including the 2000 Advanced Technical Products,
Inc. Stock Option Plan, the 2000 Advanced Technical Products, Inc. Non-
Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, the Advanced Technical Products,
Inc. Subsidiary Key Management Stock Option Plan (1996), the 1997 Advanced
Technical Products, Inc. Stock Option Plan and the Advanced Technical
Products, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (collectively, the
"Company Stock Plans") that is outstanding and unexercised, whether vested or
unvested, immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be canceled as of the
Effective Time and to be converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive, in full satisfaction of such Stock Options, cash from the Company in
an amount equal to the product of (X) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to adjustment pursuant to
the last sentence of Section 1.7(a)) and (Y) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable pursuant to such Company Option as of the Effective
Time (in each case assuming such Company Option had been fully vested and
fully exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time), which cash
payment will be made promptly following the Effective Time, and will be paid
net of any applicable federal or state withholding taxes.   Section 1.9
Conversion of Merger Subsidiary Common Stock. Each share of the common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and the
Surviving Corporation will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent.  
ARTICLE 2   PAYMENT   Section 2.1 Surrender of Certificates. From and
after the Effective Time, each holder of a certificate that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(a "Certificate") will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, upon
surrender thereof to the Paying Agent (as defined below), the Merger
Consideration into which    4   the shares of Company Common Stock
evidenced by such Certificate were converted pursuant to the Merger. No
interest will be payable on the Merger Consideration to be paid to any holder
of a Certificate irrespective of the time at which such Certificate is
surrendered for exchange.   Section 2.2 Paying Agent; Certificate Surrender
Procedures.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent will designate
(with  the approval of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld) and 
enter into an agreement with an institution or trust company to act as 
paying agent for the Merger Consideration (the "Paying Agent"). As  soon as
reasonably practical after the Effective Time, the Parent will  deposit with
the Paying Agent an amount in cash sufficient to provide  all funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payment of the Merger  Consideration pursuant to
this Agreement (the "Payment Fund"). Pending  payment of such funds to the
holders of Certificates, such funds will  be held and may be invested by the
Paying Agent as the Parent directs  (so long as such directions do not impair
the rights of holders of  Company Stock) in the direct obligations of the
United States,  obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States  is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, or 
commercial paper rated of the highest quality by Moody\'s Investors 
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation. Any net profit  resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such investments  will be payable to
the Parent or its designee, in the Parent\'s sole  discretion. The Parent
will promptly replace any funds lost through  any investment made pursuant to
this section.   (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time,  the Parent will instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each record 
holder of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which will  specify that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to  such Certificates
will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate to  the Paying Agent and
will be in such form and have such other  provisions as the Parent will
reasonably specify) and (ii)  instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Certificates for  the Merger Consideration. Upon the surrender to the
Paying Agent of  such Certificate or Certificates together with a duly
executed and  completed letter of transmittal and all other documents and
other  materials required by the Paying Agent to be delivered in connection 
therewith, the holder will be entitled to receive the Merger  Consideration
into which the Certificate or Certificates so  surrendered have been
converted in accordance with the provisions of  this Agreement. Until so
surrendered, each outstanding Certificate  will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate  purposes, to evidence the right to receive
the Merger Consideration  into which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such  Certificate have been converted in accordance with the
provisions of  this Agreement.   Section 2.3 Transfer Books. The stock
transfer books of the Company will be closed at the Effective Time, and no
transfer of any shares of Company Common Stock will thereafter be recorded on
any of the stock transfer books. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
any    5   Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not
registered in the stock transfer records of the Company at the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration into which such Company Common Stock has been
converted in the Merger will be paid to the transferee in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.2(b) only if the Certificate is surrendered as
provided in Section 2.2 and accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer (including evidence of payment of any applicable
stock transfer taxes).   Section 2.4 Termination of Payment Fund. Any
portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Parent upon
demand, and each holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously
surrendered Certificates in accordance with the provisions of this Article 2
will thereafter look only to the Parent for satisfaction of any claims for
the Merger Consideration such holder may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary nor the Surviving Corporation will
be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any portion of the
Merger Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   Section 2.5 Lost
Certificates. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit (in form and substance acceptable to the Parent) of
that fact by the person making such a claim, and, if required by the Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Parent
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.2(b).   Section 2.6 No Rights as Stockholder. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates will cease to have
any rights as a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement or by applicable Laws, and the Parent
will be entitled to treat each Certificate that has not yet been surrendered
for exchange solely as evidence of the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock evidenced by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to the Merger, provided, however,
that each holder of a Certificate that has become entitled to any dividend
declared but unpaid as of the Effective Time will continue to be entitled to
such dividend following the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation
will pay such dividend to such holder in the amount and on the date specified
therefor by the Board of Directors of the Company at the time of declaration
thereof.   Section 2.7 Withholding. The Parent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any former
holder of Company Common Stock all amounts required by law to be deducted or
withheld therefrom. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Parent
or the Merger Subsidiary, such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary.    6    Section 2.8
Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action
is determined by the Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
the Constituent Corporations, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and the Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name
of the Merger Subsidiary, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take
such action.   ARTICLE 3   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to the Parent and the Merger
Subsidiary that, except as disclosed in (i) the Company SEC Documents (as
defined in Section 3.6) filed with the SEC (as defined in Section 3.6)
subsequent to May 13, 2001 but prior to the date hereof, or (ii) the letter
dated as of the date of this Agreement from the Company to the Parent (the
"Company Disclosure Letter"):   Section 3.1 Organization. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation,
and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently being
conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to conduct business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
where such qualification or licensing is necessary, except where the failure
to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The term "Company
Material Adverse Effect" means any event, circumstance, condition, change,
development or effect that, either individually or in the aggregate with all
other events, circumstances, conditions, changes, developments or effects,
would have a material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or
otherwise), assets, liabilities, operations or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (but not taking into account
any change or effect primarily caused by conditions affecting the United
States economy or securities markets in general as a whole, or the Company\'s
industry and not specifically relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries),
or the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement. The Company has delivered to the Parent
correct and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
currently in effect for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.   Section
3.2 Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 30,000,000  shares of Company Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par  value $1.00 per    7    share, of which
600,000 shares have been designated as Series RP Preferred  Stock, (the
"Company Preferred Stock," together with the Company Common  Stock, the
"Company Stock"). As of the close of business on April 30, 2002,  (i)
5,890,064 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding,  no
shares were held by the Company as treasury shares and 1,000,000 shares  were
reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Plans; and (ii)  600,000
shares of Company Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance  pursuant to the
Rights Agreement. Since April 30, 2002, no additional  shares of capital
stock have been issued except shares issued upon the  exercise of Stock
Options issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans. All  of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have  been duly authorized
and are validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and  free of preemptive
rights. No shares of Company Preferred Stock have been  issued or are
outstanding.   (b) Other than the Stock Options to acquire an aggregate of
not more  than 604,914 shares of Company Common Stock and the Rights, there
are no  outstanding or authorized options, calls, warrants, subscription
rights,  convertible securities, conversion rights, exchange rights or
other  contracts, agreements or commitments that could require the Company or
any  of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer, sell or otherwise cause to
become  outstanding any of its capital stock. There are no outstanding
stock  appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation or similar rights
with  respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other equity
interest  in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or securities
convertible into  or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests. As of
the date hereof,  the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all
outstanding Stock  Options and stock appreciation rights, as well as the
respective exercise  prices, dates of grant and vesting schedules thereof.
The Company is not  party to or bound by any obligation to accelerate the
vesting of any Stock  Options.   (c) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any  voting trust, proxy or other agreement or
understanding with respect to the  voting of any capital stock of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.   (d) The Board of Directors of the Company has
not declared any  dividend or distribution with respect to the Company Common
Stock the  record or payment date for which is on or after the date of this
Agreement.   (e) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of
the  Company\'s Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and are validly
issued,  fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, and are
owned by  the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any and
all  liens, encumbrances, security interests, charges, pledges or other

Company has delivered to the Parent correct and complete copies of the
foregoing resolutions and opinion. This Agreement constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its
terms and conditions (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors\'
rights or by general equity principles). The action taken by the Board of
Directors of the Company constitutes approval of the Merger by the Board of
Directors of the Company under the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware
Act, and no other fair price, moratorium, control share acquisition or other

of the transactions contemplated hereby.    9    Section 3.5

of its Subsidiaries, (ii) result in a violation or breach of, be in conflict
with, or constitute or create (with or without due notice or lapse of time or

meeting of the stockholders to consider  the Merger (the "Company
Stockholders Meeting") will not, on the date the  Proxy Statement is first
mailed to the Stockholders, at the time of the  Company Stockholders Meeting
or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to  be stated therein or necessary

which is not  terminable on thirty (30) days notice without liability; or (H)
other    13    agreement, contract or binding commitment which is
material to the  operation, or which is outside the ordinary course, of the

forth in this  section shall not be deemed in any respect to define
materiality for other  purposes of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure

respect to any person,  without duplication, (1) all obligations of such
person for borrowed money,  (2) all obligations of others secured by any Lien
on property or assets  owned or acquired by such person, whether or not the
obligations secured  thereby have been assumed, (3) all letters of credit

or has received written notice of any breach of or  default under (or, would
be in default, breach or violation with notice or  lapse of time, or both),
any Company Material Agreement, except for any  such breach or default, that
would not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the  knowledge of the Company, no other
party to any of the Company Material  Agreements has breached or is in
default of any of its obligations  thereunder. Each of the Company Material
Agreements is in full force and  effect, and will continue to be in full
force and effect following  consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except in any such  case for breaches, defaults or failures that
would not, individually or in  the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse  Effect. Each of the Company Material Agreements
constitutes the valid and  legally binding obligation of the Company or the
appropriate Subsidiary  that is a party thereto (except as enforceability may
be limited by  applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent  transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting  creditors\' rights or by general equity principles). Neither the
Company nor  any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of
termination,  cancellation or non-renewal with respect to any Company
Material Agreement,  and to the Company\'s knowledge, no other party to a
Company Material  Agreement plans to terminate, cancel or not renew any such
agreement.   (c) With respect to each contract, agreement, bid or proposal
between  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any (i) Governmental

facilities or (ii) third party relating to a contract between such third 
party and any domestic or foreign government or governmental agency (each a 
"Government Contract"), (A) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have 
complied in all material respects with all terms and conditions of such 
Government Contract, including all clauses, provisions and requirements 
incorporated expressly by reference, or by operation of law therein, (B)  the
Company and each of its    14    Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all requirements  of all Laws, or agreements
pertaining to such Government Contract,  including where applicable the "Cost
Accounting Standards" disclosure  statement of the Company or such
Subsidiary, (C) all representations and  certifications executed,
acknowledged or set forth in or pertaining to such  Government Contract were
complete and correct as of their effective dates  and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied with all such  representations and certifications,
(D) neither the United States  government nor any prime contractor,
subcontractor or other person or  entity has notified the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, in writing or  orally, that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has breached or  violated any Law, certification,
representation, clause, provision or  requirement pertaining to such
Government Contract, (E) neither the Company  nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice of termination for  convenience, notice of termination
for default, cure notice or show cause  notice pertaining to such Government
Contract, (F) other than in the  ordinary course of business, no cost
incurred by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries pertaining to such
Government Contract has been questioned or  challenged, is the subject of any
audit or investigation or has been  disallowed by any Governmental Entity,
and (G) no payments due to the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining
to such Government Contract  have been withheld or set off, nor has any claim
been made to withhold or  set off money, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
are entitled to all  progress or other payments received with respect
thereto, except for any  such failure, noncompliance, inaccuracy, breach,
violation, termination,  cost, investigation, disallowance or payment that
would not, individually  or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material  Adverse Effect.   (d) To the Company\'s knowledge,
neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees,  consultants or agents is or since December
31, 1997 has been under any  administrative, civil or criminal investigation,
indictment or audit by any  Governmental Entity or under investigation by the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries with respect to any alleged improper act
or omission arising  under or relating to any Government Contract.   (e)
There exist (i) no material outstanding claims against the Company  or any of
its Subsidiaries, either by any Governmental Entity or by any  prime
contractor, subcontractor, vendor or other person or entity, arising  under
or relating to any Government Contract, and (ii) no material disputes 
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the United States 
government under the Contract Disputes Act, as amended, or any other  federal
statute, or between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any  prime
contractor, subcontractor or vendor arising under or relating to any 
Government Contract. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has  (i)
any interest in any pending claim against any prime contractor, 
subcontractor or vendor arising under or relating to any Government 
Contract, which, if adversely determined against the Company would, 
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to    15   
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) any interest in any pending 
or potential material claim against any Governmental Entity.   (f) Since
December 31, 1997, neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has been
debarred or suspended from participation in the award  of contracts with the
United States government or any other Governmental  Entity (excluding for
this purpose ineligibility to bid on certain  contracts due to generally
applicable bidding requirements). To the  Company\'s knowledge, there exist
no facts or circumstances that would  warrant the institution of suspension
or debarment proceedings or the  finding of nonresponsibility or
ineligibility on the part of the Company,  any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors, officers or  employees. No payment has been made
by or on behalf of the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries in connection with
any Government Contract in violation  of applicable procurement laws, rules
and regulations or in violation of,  or requiring disclosure pursuant to, the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of  1977, as amended.   (g) Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is (or has been  since December 31, 2001)
a party to a material transaction with an  Affiliate (as defined below), nor
are there any commitments to do so in the  future. The assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries do not include any  receivable or other obligation or
commitment from an Affiliate, and the  liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries do not include any payable  or other obligation or commitment to
any Affiliate. No Affiliate is a party  to any contract with any customer or
supplier of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries, except that with respect
to any Affiliate that is an  Affiliate solely based on its ownership of 5% or
more of the voting  securities of the Company, such representation is made to
the knowledge of  the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, "Affiliate"
shall mean any  individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint  venture, association, unincorporated organization, or other
entity that (i)  owns 5% or more of the voting securities of the Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries, (ii) is a director, executive or officer employed
by the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) directly or indirectly 
controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Company or 
any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 3.11 Tax Matters.   (a) (i) The Company

arising as a result of being or  ceasing to be a member of any affiliated
group, or being included or  required to be included in any Tax Return
relating thereto (collectively  "Taxes"), and all such Tax Returns are
correct and complete in all material  respects. As of the time of filing, the
foregoing Tax Returns correctly  reflected the facts regarding the income,
business, assets, operations,  activities, status, or other matters of the
Company and any of its  Subsidiaries, or any other information required to be
shown thereon; (ii)  the foregoing Tax Returns are not subject to penalties
under Section 6662  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(together with the rules  and regulation thereunder, the "Code"), relating to
accuracy-related  penalties (or any corresponding provision of the state,
local or foreign  Tax law) or any predecessor provision of Law; (iii) an

have been paid to the proper Tax Authority or other person; and (vii) the 
Company or any of its Subsidiaries have not waived any statute of

respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.   (b) The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have complied with all  applicable Tax Laws and agreements
(including under Tax allocation  agreements), and all amounts required to be
paid by the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries to Tax Authorities or others
have been paid or adequately  reserved for in accordance with GAAP in the
financial statements of the  Company.   (c) The unpaid Taxes of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as of  the most recent financial statement
contained in the Company SEC Documents  (i) did not exceed the accrued Tax
liability (rather than any reserve for  deferred Taxes established to reflect
differences between book and Tax  income) set forth either on the face of the
Company consolidated balance  sheet, or in the notes thereto; and (ii) will
not exceed that accrued Tax  liability as adjusted for operations and
transactions through the Closing  Date in accordance with the past practice
of the Company in filing its Tax  Returns or in preparing its consolidated
financial statements.    17    (d) The Company does not expect any Tax
Authority to assess any  additional Tax against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any  period for which Tax Returns have been filed. There is
no dispute or claim  concerning any Tax liability of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries  either claimed or raised by any Tax Authority in writing,
or to the  knowledge of the Company, based upon personal contact of any
officer,  employee or agent of the Company with any agent of such Tax
Authority. The  Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (i) the taxable years of

any other person (other than the Company or a Subsidiary)  under the
provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or similar  provisions of
state, local or foreign Tax law) as a transferee or successor  by contract or
otherwise.   (f) The Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the net operating
loss  carryovers and any Tax attribute carryovers of the Company (including
net  capital losses, excess foreign tax credits, excess general business

382,  383 or 384 of the Code or the SRLY limitations of Treasury Regulation 
Sections 1.1502-21 or 1.1502-22 on the ability of the Company to use such

Company will (a) duly call, set a record date for, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting solely to approve the Merger and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement which will
include all information pertaining to the transactions contemplated hereby or
as otherwise required by the Exchange Act for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein, (c) promptly respond to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the preliminary proxy statement, and (d) cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders. The Proxy Statement will
not, at the date mailed to the Company Stockholders, at the time of the
Company Stockholder\'s Meeting, or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If
before the Effective Time, any matter is discovered by the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement,
the Company will promptly inform the Parent in writing and prepare and
distribute appropriate amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement.
Except as permitted by Section 5.6(c), the Board of Directors of the Company
will at all times prior to and during the Company Stockholders Meeting,
recommend to the Company Stockholders the adoption of this Agreement, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and will use its best efforts
to solicit such approval by the Company Stockholders. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company\'s obligation pursuant to the first
sentence of this section will not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of
any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal (each as defined in Section
5.6).   Section 5.5 Additional Reports. The Company will furnish to the
Parent copies of any Company SEC Documents that it files with the SEC on or
after the date hereof, and the    33   Company represents and warrants
that as of the respective dates thereof, such reports will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Any unaudited consolidated interim financial statements included
in such reports (including any related notes and schedules) will
fairly present, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of its
operations and its cash flows or other information included therein for the
periods or as of the dates then ended, subject to normal year-end
adjustments, in each case in accordance with past practice and with GAAP
consistently applied.   Section 5.6 Nonsolicitation of Acquisition
Proposals.   (a) The Company, each of its Subsidiaries, and each of their 
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives 
(collectively, the "Company Representatives"), will immediately cease any 
discussions or negotiations presently being conducted with respect to any 
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in (f) below), and will not (i) initiate, 
encourage, induce, facilitate or solicit, directly or indirectly, any 
inquiries with respect to, or the making of, any Acquisition Proposal, or 
(ii) engage in or continue any negotiations or discussions with, furnish  any
information or data to, or enter into any letter of intent, agreement  in
principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement, arrangement or 
understanding with any party relating to any Acquisition Proposal (each an 
"Acquisition Agreement"); provided, however, that prior to obtaining the 
Company Stockholders Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may,  in
response to a bona fide, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that it  determines
in good faith (after consulting with an independent financial  advisor) is
reasonably likely to result in or lead to a Superior Proposal  (as defined in
(g) below), (A) furnish information with respect to the  Company and its
Subsidiaries to the person making such Superior Proposal  pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement containing provisions at least as  restrictive with
respect to such person as the restrictions on the Parent  contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 5.9), and  (B) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the person making such  Superior
Proposal, if and only to the extent that, in each case referred to  in (A)
and (B), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good  faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that such action  would be
legally required in order to comply with their fiduciary duties to  the
Company Stockholders under applicable Laws. The Company will be  responsible
for any breach of the provisions of this section by any of its  Subsidiaries
or any of the Company Representatives.   (b) Within 24 hours after its
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, the  Company will provide the Parent
with a copy of such Acquisition Proposal  or, in connection with any non-
written Acquisition Proposal, a written  statement setting forth in
reasonable detail the terms and conditions of  such Acquisition Proposal,
including the identity of the acquiring party.  The Company will promptly
inform the Parent of the status and content of  any discussions or
negotiations involving any Acquisition Proposal and will  promptly furnish to
the Parent any non-public information furnished in    34    connection
therewith. Within 24 hours after any determination by the Board  of Directors
of the Company that an Acquisition Proposal may be a Superior  Proposal, the
Company will notify the Parent of such determination.   (c) Except as
expressly permitted by this section, neither the Board  of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof will (i) withdraw or  modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to  the Parent, the
approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or  such committee of
the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend,  or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal,  (iii) cause the Company
to enter into any Acquisition Agreement or (iv)  redeem or otherwise render
inapplicable the Rights Agreement, or the Rights  granted thereunder in
response to any Acquisition Proposal, unless prior to  obtaining the Company
Stockholders Approval, the Board of Directors of the  Company (x) receives a
Superior Proposal that is not subject to any  financing condition, and (y)
determines in good faith (after consultation  with outside legal counsel)
that such action would be legally required in  order for its directors to
comply with their respective fiduciary duties to  the Company Stockholders
under applicable Laws; provided, that the Company  shall immediately inform
the Parent orally and in writing of the material  terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and the identity of the  Person making it, or such
other circumstances, and if any Superior Proposal  is in writing, the Company
shall immediately deliver a copy thereof to the  Parent. Any withdrawal or
modification of the recommendation of the Board  of Directors of the Company
or other action taken pursuant to this  subsection (c) shall not change the
approval of the Board of Directors of  the Company for purposes of causing
any state takeover statute or other  state law to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby,  including the Merger.   (d)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if, prior  to
obtaining the Company Stockholders Approval, the Board of Directors of  the
Company determines, in its good faith judgment, that an Acquisition  Proposal
is a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may  terminate
this Agreement (subject to the Company\'s obligations under  Article 7);
provided, that (i) the Company provides at least five business  days prior
written notice to the Parent of its intention to terminate this  Agreement,
(ii) during such five business day period (or longer period if  extended by
the Company and the Parent, the "Negotiation Period"), the  Company agrees to
negotiate in good faith with the Parent regarding such  changes as the Parent
may propose to the terms of this Agreement, with the  intent of enabling the
Parent to agree to a modification of this Agreement  so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated, (iii)  after expiration of the
Negotiation Period, the Acquisition Proposal  remains a Superior Proposal
(taking into account any modifications to the  terms thereof proposed by the
Parent) and the Board of Directors of the  Company confirms its determination
(after consultation with outside legal  counsel and an independent financial
advisor) that it is a Superior  Proposal; and (iv) the Company pays to the
Parent in immediately available  funds the Termination Fee (as defined in and
in accordance with Section  7.3).    35    (e) Nothing in this section
will prevent the Board of Directors of the  Company from taking, and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders, a position  contemplated by Rules
14d-9(e) and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange  Act.   (f) The term
"Acquisition Proposal" as used in this Agreement means  any inquiry, proposal
or offer relating to a possible (i) merger,  consolidation or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries; (ii) sale,
lease or other disposition, directly or  indirectly, (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange or  otherwise) of any assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries  representing, in the aggregate, 20% or
more of those assets on a  consolidated basis; (iii) issuance, sale or other
disposition of (including  by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or
otherwise) securities  (or options, rights or warrants to purchase or
securities convertible into,  such securities) representing 20% or more of
the votes attached to the  outstanding securities of the Company, (iv)
transaction with the Company in  which any person would acquire "beneficial
ownership" (as defined in Rule  13d-3 under the Exchange Act), or the right
to acquire beneficial  ownership, or any "group" (as defined under the
Exchange Act) will have  been formed which beneficially owns or has the right
to acquire beneficial  ownership of, 20% or more of the outstanding
securities of the Company, (v)  liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or
other similar type of  transaction with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (vi)  transaction which is similar in form, substance or
purpose to any of the  foregoing transactions or (vii) public announcement of
an agreement,  proposal, plan or intent to do any of the foregoing; provided,
however,  that the term "Acquisition Proposal" will not include the Merger
and the  transactions contemplated hereby.   (g) The term "Superior
Proposal" as used in this Agreement means any  Acquisition Proposal not
solicited in violation of this Section 5.6 that is  on terms that the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good  faith (after consulting with
outside legal counsel and an independent  financial advisor) would (i) result
in a transaction that is more favorable  from a financial point of view to
the Company Stockholders than the  transactions contemplated hereby if such
Acquisition Proposal were to be  consummated and (ii) has a reasonable
likelihood of being consummated.   Section 5.7 Indemnification.   (a) From
and after the Closing Date, the Parent will cause the  Surviving Corporation
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person  who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer  or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the  "Indemnified Parties")
from and against all losses, claims, damages and  expenses (including
reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses) arising out of  or relating to
actions or omissions, or alleged actions or omissions,  occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted  from time to time by
the Delaware Act, but excluding any of the foregoing  which relate to any
violation or alleged violation of the Exchange Act with  respect to insider
trading.    36    (b) Any initial determination required to be made with
respect to  whether any Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification
will, if  requested by such Indemnified Party, be made by independent legal
counsel  selected by the Indemnified Party and reasonably satisfactory to
the  Surviving Corporation.   (c) For a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date, the Parent  will use its best efforts to cause to be maintained
in effect policies of  directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability  insurance substantially equivalent in scope and amount
of coverage to the  policies maintained by the Company as of the date hereof
with respect to  claims arising from or relating to actions or omissions, or
alleged actions  or omissions, occurring on or prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding  the provisions of this Section 5.7(c), the Parent will not
be obligated to  make total premium payments with respect to such policies of
insurance to  the extent such premiums exceed 200 percent of the last annual
premium paid  by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement. If the
annual premium  costs necessary to maintain such insurance coverage exceed
the foregoing  amount, the Parent will use its best efforts to maintain the
most  advantageous policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and  fiduciary liability insurance reasonably obtainable for an annual
premium  not exceeding the foregoing amount, provided that Indemnified
Parties may  be required to make application and provide customary
representations and  warranties to the insurance carrier for the purpose of
obtaining such  insurance.   (d) Subject to the remainder of this section,
to the fullest extent  permitted from time to time under the Delaware Act,
the Parent will cause  the Surviving Corporation to pay on an as-incurred
basis the reasonable  fees and expenses of each Indemnified Party (including
reasonable fees and  expenses of counsel) in advance of the final disposition
of any action,  suit, proceeding or investigation that is the subject of the
right to  indemnification, subject to reimbursement in the event such
Indemnified  Party is not entitled to indemnification.   (e) The provisions
providing for director and officer indemnification,  abrogation of liability
and advancement of expenses set forth in the  certificate of incorporation
and/or bylaws of the Company as in effect  immediately prior to the date
hereof, will apply to each Indemnified Party  with respect to all matters
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time.  The foregoing will not be
deemed to restrict the right of the Surviving  Corporation to modify the
provisions of its certificate of incorporation  relating to director and
officer indemnification, abrogation of liability  or advancement of expenses
with respect to events or occurrences after the  Closing Date but such
modifications shall not adversely affect the rights  of the Indemnified
Parties hereunder. The Parent shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to honor
the provisions of this Section 5.7(e).   (f) Subject to any requirements
pursuant to applicable insurance  policies that might conflict with the
provisions of this subsection, in the  event any action, suit,    37   
investigation or proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Parties and 
under applicable standards of professional conduct there is a conflict of 
interest on any significant issue between the position of the Parent (or  the
Surviving Corporation) and an Indemnified Party, the Indemnified  Parties may
retain counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory  to the
Parent, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay  all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified  Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received, provided, however  that (1) the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to  assume the
defense thereof (which right shall not affect the right of the  Indemnified
Parties to be reimbursed for separate counsel as specified in  the preceding
sentence), (2) the Parent and the Indemnified Parties will  cooperate in the
defense of any such matter and (3) neither Parent nor the  Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without  its prior
written consent. The Indemnified Parties as a group may not  retain more than
one counsel to represent them with respect to each such  matter unless under
applicable standards of professional conduct there is a  conflict of interest
on any significant issue between the positions of two  or more Indemnified
Parties.   (g) Upon learning of any loss, claim, damage or expense which may
give  rise to a claim for indemnity hereunder, any Indemnified Party shall 
promptly notify Parent thereof in writing, but any failure to give such 
notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations of any party under 
this Section 5.7 unless such failure jeopardizes or prejudices the Parent  or
the Surviving Corporation in any material respect.   (h) The rights of each
Indemnified Party hereunder will be in addition  to any other rights such
Indemnified Party may have under the certificate  of incorporation or bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation or any of their  respective Subsidiaries, under
the Delaware Act or otherwise.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or  otherwise, the provisions of this Section 5.7
will survive the consummation  of the Merger, and each Indemnified Party
will, for all purposes, be a  third party beneficiary of the covenants and
agreements contained in this  Section 5.7 and, accordingly, will be treated
as a party to this Agreement  for purposes of the rights and remedies
relating to enforcement of such  covenants and agreements and will be
entitled to enforce any such rights  and exercise any such remedies directly
against the Parent and the  Surviving Corporation.   (i) Nothing in this
Section 5.7 will diminish any rights or  entitlements available to any
director or officer of the Company under the  Company\'s certificate of
incorporation as in effect immediately prior to  the date hereof.   Section
5.8 Public Announcements. The initial press releases issued by each party
announcing the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will be in a form that is mutually acceptable to the Parent and the
Company. Thereafter, the Parent and the Company will consult with one another
before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public
announcements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and    38   except as may be required by applicable law or by
the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange or of The Nasdaq
Stock Market, will not issue any such press release or make any such
announcement prior to such consultation.   Section 5.9 Full Access. The
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives
to, afford the Parent and its officers, employees, agents and representatives
full access to all premises, properties, employees, information, books,
records, contracts and documents of or pertaining to the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Any information disclosed will be subject to the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parent and the Company effective
March 11, 2002 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").   Section 5.10 Actions
Regarding Antitakeover Statutes. If Section 203 of the Delaware Act or any
other fair price, moratorium, control share acquisition or other form of
antitakeover statute, rule or regulation is or becomes applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the
Company will grant such approvals and take such other actions as may
be required so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.   Section 5.11 Employee Benefit Matters.   (a) Subject to
applicable collective bargaining agreements, until (or  in respect of the
period ending on) December 31, 2002, the Parent will  cause to be maintained
for the employees and former employees of the  Company and its Subsidiaries
(the "Employees"), benefits and benefit levels  which are, in the aggregate,
substantially comparable to benefits and  benefit levels as provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries through any  Company Plan that is an Employee
Pension Benefit Plan, or Employee Welfare  Benefit Plan, or a fringe benefit
program providing for such matters as  sick pay and vacation pay, immediately
prior to the Effective Time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this section
will not apply to any bonus,  incentive, or equity-based plan or arrangement,
including the Advanced  Technical Products, Inc. 1998 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the "ESPP") or  the Advanced Technical Products, Inc. Deferred
Compensation Plan (the  "Deferred Compensation Plan").   (b) Solely for
purposes of eligibility and vesting under the employee  benefit plans of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving  Corporation) providing
benefits to any Employees after the Effective Time,  each Employee will be
credited with his or her years of service with the  Company and its
Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, to the same extent  as such employee
was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for  such service under
any similar Company Plan. Following the Effective Time,  the Parent will, or
will cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any  pre-existing condition
limitation under any Employee Welfare Benefit Plan  maintained by the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries in which Employees and  their eligible dependents
participate (except to the extent that such  pre-existing condition
limitation would have been applicable under the  comparable Company Employee
Welfare Benefit Plans immediately prior to the    39    Effective Time),
and (ii) provide each Employee with credit for any  co-payments and
deductibles incurred prior to the Effective Time (or such  earlier or later
transition date to new Employee Welfare Benefits Plans)  for the calendar
year in which the Effective Time (or such earlier or later  transaction date)
occurs, in satisfying any applicable deductible or  out-of-pocket
requirements under any welfare plans that the Employees  participate in after
the Effective Time.   (c) The Company agrees that an independent trustee,
either a bank or a  trust company, will act with respect to the Merger on
behalf of each  Company Plan (and its participants) that holds Company Common
Stock in  accordance with the terms and conditions of such Company Plan.  
(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the  Board
of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee  administering
the ESPP) will adopt such resolutions or take such other  actions (if any) as
may be required to provide that (i) with respect to the  offering period
under the ESPP under way immediately prior to the Effective  Time, the
scheduled exercise date will be accelerated, and all unexercised  rights
granted in respect of such offering period will be exercised not  later than
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) all holding  periods with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP will  be waived
immediately prior to the consummation of the Company Stockholders  Approval
so as to permit the holders thereof to approve this Agreement, and  (iii) the
ESPP will terminate at the Effective Time.   (e) No additional Stock
Options, stock appreciation rights or other  equity-based awards or other
rights to acquire Company Stock will be  granted pursuant to the Company
Stock Plans or otherwise after the date of  this Agreement. The Company, its
Board of Directors, or any committee  thereof, shall take all actions prior
to the Effective Time necessary,  proper or advisable to effect the
consummation of the actions contemplated  by the provisions of Section 1.8
herein, including but not limited to  making appropriate amendments to the
Company Stock Plans and/or their  underlying agreements.   (f) Nothing
contained in this section will create any rights in any  third party,
including without limitation, any right to employment or right  to any
particular benefit. Except as specifically provided, nothing  contained
herein will be construed as prohibiting or restricting in any way  the right
of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any successor  thereto) to
modify, amend or terminate any employee benefit plan, program  or arrangement
in whole or in part at any time after the Effective Time.   (g) As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the  Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company or the  Chief Executive Officer of
the Company (or, if appropriate, any other  individual administering the
Deferred Compensation Plan) will adopt such  resolutions or take such other
actions (if any) as may be necessary, proper  or advisable to terminate the
Deferred Compensation    40    Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time such that all account balances  thereunder will be distributed in
accordance with the termination  provisions of said plan.   Section 5.12
Standstill Provisions. The restrictions on the Parent and the Merger
Subsidiary contained in Section 9 of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby
waived by the Company to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the Parent
and the Merger Subsidiary to comply with their obligations or enforce their
rights under this Agreement.   Section 5.13 Notice of Developments. The
Company will give prompt written notice to the Parent of the occurrence of
any event which would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Parent will give prompt written
notice to the other of the occurrence or failure to occur of an event that
would, or, with the lapse of time would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition to the consummation of the Merger not to be satisfied. No such
written notice will be deemed to have amended any of the disclosures set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, to have qualified the representations
and warranties contained herein or to have cured any misrepresentation or
breach of a representation or warranty that otherwise might have existed
hereunder by reason of such material development.   ARTICLE 6   CONDITIONS
TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER   Section 6.1 Conditions to the
Obligations of Each Party. The respective obligation of each party to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby is
subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Closing Date of each of the

enters into an  agreement to    44    consummate or consummates, an

mean an "Acquisition Proposal" as  defined in Section 5.6(f), except that all
references therein to "20%"  shall be deemed instead to be "50%"), then upon

The Company shall make all such payments required by Section 7.3 promptly
(and in any event within two business days of receipt by the Company of
written notice from the Parent) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Parent. The Company acknowledges that
the agreements regarding the Termination Fee contained in this Agreement are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that in
the absence of such agreements, the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary would
not have entered into this Agreement. The Company accordingly agrees that in
the event the Company fails to pay the Termination Fee promptly, the Company
will in addition to the payment of such amount, also pay to the Parent all of
the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees
and expenses) incurred by the Parent in the enforcement of its rights under
Section 7.3, together with interest on such amount at a rate of 10% per annum
from the date upon which such payment was due, to and including the date of
payment. If the Company has not breached Section 5.6, payment of the
Termination Fee will be in full and complete satisfaction of, and will be the
Parent\'s sole and exclusive remedy for, any loss, liability, damage or claim
arising out of or related to any such termination of this Agreement.   
45    ARTICLE 8   MISCELLANEOUS   Section 8.1 Nonsurvival of
Representations. None of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or other writing delivered
pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Merger or the termination of this
Agreement.   Section 8.2 Specific Performance. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is

of the terms of this Agreement, without posting a bond or other security,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity.   Section 8.3 Successors and Assigns. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations provided by this Agreement
will be assigned by any of the parties (whether by operation of law or

benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.   Section 8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
execution and delivery of a written instrument by or on behalf of the Parent,
the Merger Subsidiary and the Company at any time before or after the Company
Stockholders Approval, provided that after the date of the Company
Stockholders Approval, no amendment to this Agreement will be made without
the approval of the stockholders of the Company if and to the extent such
approval is required under the Delaware Act.   Section 8.5 Extension of
Time; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may extend
the time for performance of or waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions of the other parties to this Agreement, and may

valid or binding unless it is in writing and is executed and delivered by or
on behalf of the party against which it is sought to be enforced.   Section
8.6 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,

Agreement.   Section 8.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two

matter hereof.   Section 8.12 Construction. The language used in this
Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to express
their mutual intent and no rule of strict construction will be applied
against any party. The use of the word "including" in this Agreement means
"including without limitation" and is intended by the parties to be by way of
example rather than limitation. As used in this Agreement, the qualification
"to the Company\'s knowledge" and clauses of similar effect mean the actual
knowledge after due inquiry of any executive officer of the Company or of its

Subsidiaries if such officer or manager has primary responsibility over the
subject matter in question) of the existence or absence of facts which would

court, and agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties to this
Agreement agrees not to assert in any action or proceeding arising out of
relating to this Agreement that the venue is improper, and waives any defense
of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required
of any other party with respect thereto.   Section 8.14 Governing Law. THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE COMPANY DISCLOSURE LETTER WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, without giving Effect
to Any LAW OR RULE THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN
THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO BE APPLIED.   Section 8.15 Disclosure.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Company
Disclosure Letter, (i) the disclosure of information in the Company SEC
Documents will constitute disclosure for purposes of the provisions of
Article III only to the extent that the significance of such information is
apparent based solely on the disclosure contained in such Company SEC
Document, and (ii) information disclosed in a particular section of
the Company Disclosure Letter will not be deemed to have been disclosed for
any other    48   sections or purposes of this Agreement. The mere
disclosure or listing of an agreement, item, matter, circumstance, condition,
property or individual will not be sufficient to disclose a breach,
violation, dispute, claim or any similar condition or circumstance relating
thereto.   * * * *    49    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto
