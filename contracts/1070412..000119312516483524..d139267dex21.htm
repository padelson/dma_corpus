30 Section 2.04 Escrow.

 

(a) _Delivery of Escrow Amount_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to the Escrow
Agent the Escrow Amount in cash payable by wire transfer of immediately
available funds for deposit into an escrow account in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) _Escrow Amount_. The Escrow Amount shall serve as security for the payment
to satisfy any Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnities for any Regulatory
Costs (as set forth below) and under Section 6.03 and Article VIII, and shall
be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) _Regulatory Costs_.

 

(i) The Escrow Amount will be used, in part, to pay for any Losses (including
fines, penalties, fees and associated interest or charges related thereto)
imposed by any Governmental Authority (including MSHA, EPA, Virginia Division
of Mine Land Reclamation, the Virginia Department of Mine Minerals and Energy,
West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and the West
Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training) for citations, orders
or other enforcement Actions of any type or kind based on events,
circumstances, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Closing Date
and relating to (a) any Permit or Mining Authorization, (b) any facility
owned, controlled or operated by Target prior to the Closing Date including,
without limitation, the facilities with the MSHA identification numbers
44-04856, 46-09084, assigned thereto and all reasonable attorneys fees and
costs incurred by Buyer in the handling and resolution thereof, whether by
settlement, administrative litigation or otherwise (clauses (a) and (b) are
collectively referred to as the "Regulatory Costs") in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

(ii) With respect to any Actions or claims related to any Regulatory Costs
("Regulatory Actions"), Seller Parties agree that Buyer shall control the
defense of the Regulatory Actions with counsel reasonably selected by Buyer,
including its transaction counsel, Dinsmore and Shohl LLP. Buyer shall conduct
the defense of the Regulatory Actions actively and diligently and Parent and
Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in such defense and make available to Buyer,
at Parents and Sellers expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials
and information in the possession or under the control of Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates relating thereto as is reasonably required by
Buyer. Buyer shall not settle any Regulatory Action without the prior consent
of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld, unless
an immediate settlement or compromise of a Regulatory Action is necessary to
avoid a SMCRA "permit block" or similar adverse effect on Buyers other

 



31  operations. Buyer shall be reimbursed out of the Escrow Amount for all
reasonable fees and costs (including attorneys fees) that Buyer incurs
defending any Regulatory Actions to the extent such fees and costs arise out
of Regulatory Costs for which Buyer is entitled to reimbursement under this
Section 2.04(c).

(iii) From and after the Closing Date, to the extent Parent agrees with such
Regulatory Costs (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), Parent and Buyer agree to execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent joint written instructions, not more frequently than monthly, unless
otherwise agreed between the parties, for the payment of Regulatory Costs.
Following the Closing Date, upon receiving joint written instructions from
both Parent and Buyer that a determination has been made with respect to the
amount of a Regulatory Cost, the Escrow Agent shall pay the amount so
determined to the payee designated in the joint written instruction.

 

(d) _Escrow Release_.

(i) Subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Sellers no later than three
Business Days after the first anniversary of the Closing Date the portion of
the Escrow Amount in excess of $11,000,000 that remains in the account
holding the Escrow Amount as of the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"First Escrow Release Date") and the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Sellers no
later than three Business Days after the second anniversary of the Closing
Date the remaining portion of the Escrow Amount (as reduced by any amounts
previously disbursed to Buyer) (the "Second Escrow Release Date" and together
with the First Escrow Release Date, collectively, the "Escrow Release Dates"
or individually a "Escrow Release Date"). In the event, however, that Sellers
have received, on or before the applicable Escrow Release Date, a notice (a
"Claim Notice") from Buyer that the Escrow Agent may be required to disburse
all or a portion of the Escrow Amount (such claimed amount, the "Claim
Amount") to Buyer pursuant to Section 6.03, Article VIII or for Regulatory
Costs, then the portion of the Escrow Amount subject to such Claim Notice
shall continue to be held by the Escrow Agent (and not disbursed to Sellers on
any Escrow Release Date) until the Claim Amount with respect thereto has
been resolved. As soon as any dispute with respect to such Claim Amount has
been resolved in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be instructed to disburse such portion of
the Escrow Amount, if any, as is required to be disbursed to Buyer pursuant
to Section 6.03, Article VIII or for Regulatory Costs in connection with such
Claim Amount, and the Escrow Agent shall disburse any remaining portion of the
Claim Amount to Seller in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, subject to the limitations on disbursements to Seller set
forth in this Section 2.04.

 

Section 2.05 Transactions to be Effected at the Closing.

 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers:

 

(i) An amount equal to (x) the Base Purchase Price minus (y) the Escrow Amount
minus (z) the Holdback, subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 2.06,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent to Buyer no later than two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date; and

 

(ii) the Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement) and all other
agreements, documents, instruments or certificates required to be delivered
by Buyer at or prior to the Closing pursuant to Section 7.03 of this
Agreement.

 



32 (b) At the Closing, Seller Parties shall deliver to Buyer:

 

(i) an assignment of the Membership Interests to Buyer in the form of _Exhibit
J_ hereto (the "Assignment"), duly executed by Seller;

(ii) the Transaction Documents (other than the Assignment and this Agreement)
and all other agreements, documents, instruments or certificates required to
be delivered by Seller at or prior to the Closing pursuant to Section 7.02 of
this Agreement.

 

Section 2.06 Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a) Holdback. At the Closing, Buyer shall retain and not pay to Sellers the
amount (the "Holdback") set forth in that certain side letter executed by
Buyer and Parent dated as of the date of this Agreement (the "Side Letter"),
subject to the conditions of the Side Letter. Buyer shall pay the Holdback to
Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Parent once the conditions set forth in the Side
Letter with respect to the Holdback are satisfied.

 

(b) Closing Adjustment.

 

(i) At least three Business Days before the Closing, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth its good faith estimate of Closing
Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"), which statement
shall contain an estimated balance sheet of Target as of the Closing Date
(without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein), a
calculation of Estimated Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing
Working Capital Statement") in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit K_, and a
certificate of the Chief Accounting Officer of Parent that the Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with GAAP,
consistent with past practice.

(ii) The "Closing Adjustment" shall be an amount equal to the Estimated
Closing Working Capital minus the Working Capital Target. If the Closing
Adjustment is a positive number, the Base Purchase Price shall be increased by
the amount of the Closing Adjustment. If the Closing Adjustment is a negative
number, the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of the Closing
Adjustment.

 

(c) Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(i) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Parent a statement setting forth its calculation of Closing Working Capital,
which statement shall contain an unaudited balance sheet of Target as of the
Closing Date (without giving effect to the transactions contemplated herein),
a calculation of Closing Working Capital (the "Closing 

 



33  Working Capital Statement") and a certificate of the Chief Accounting
Officer of Buyer that the Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in
accordance with GAAP, consistent with past practices. The parties agree that
the purpose of preparing the Closing Working Capital Statement and determining
the Closing Working Capital and the related purchase price adjustment
contemplated by this Section 2.06 is to measure the amount of Closing Working
Capital, and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of
different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies from those used in
the preparation of the Interim Financial Statements, but only to the extent
that such judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies that were used in
the preparation of the Interim Financial Statements were in accordance with
GAAP.

(ii) The post-closing adjustment shall be an amount equal to the Closing
Working Capital minus the Estimated Closing Working Capital (the "Post-Closing
Adjustment"). If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive number, Buyer shall
pay to Sellers an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-
Closing Adjustment is a negative number, Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(d) Examination and Review.

 

(i) _Examination._ After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement,
Parent shall have 60 days (the "Review Period") to review the Closing Working
Capital Statement. During the Review Period, Parent and Parents Accountants
shall have full access to the books and records of Target, the personnel of,
and work papers prepared by, Buyer and/or Buyers Accountants to the extent
that they relate to the Closing Working Capital Statement and to such
historical financial information (to the extent in Buyers or its
Representatives possession) relating to the Closing Working Capital
Statement as Seller or Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of
reviewing the Closing Working Capital Statement and to prepare a Statement of
Objections, _provided,_ that such access shall be in a manner that does not
interfere with the normal business operations of Buyer or Target.

(ii) _Objection._ On or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
Parent may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by delivering to
Buyer a written statement setting forth Parents objections in reasonable
detail, indicating each disputed item or amount and the basis for Parents
disagreement therewith (the "Statement of Objections"). If Parent fails to
deliver the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Post-Closing Adjustment,
as the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement shall
be deemed to have been accepted by Sellers. If Parent delivers the Statement
of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and Parent
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections within 30 days after
the delivery of the Statement of Objections (the "Resolution Period"), and, if
the same are so resolved within the Resolution Period, the Post-Closing
Adjustment and the Closing Working Capital Statement with such changes as may
have been previously agreed in writing by Buyer and Parent, shall be final and
binding on the parties.

 



34 (iii) _Resolution of Disputes._ If Parent and Buyer fail to reach an agreement
with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of Objections
before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts remaining in
dispute ("Disputed Amounts" and any amounts not so disputed, the
"Undisputed Amounts") shall be submitted for resolution to
PriceWaterhouseCoopers or, if PriceWaterhouseCoopers is unable to serve, Buyer
and Parent shall appoint by mutual agreement the office of an impartial
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants other
than Parents Accountants or Buyers Accountants (the "Independent
Accountant") who, acting as experts and not arbitrators, shall resolve the
Disputed Amounts only and make any adjustments to the Post-Closing
Adjustment, as the case may be, and the Closing Working Capital Statement. The
Independent Accountants determination shall be based solely on this Section
2.06, the definition of Closing Working Capital contained herein and the
judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies from those used in the preparation
of the Interim Financial Statement, so long as such judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies used in the preparation of the Interim Financial
Statement were consistent with GAAP. The Independent Accountant shall only
decide the specific items under dispute by the parties and their decision for
each Disputed Amount must be within the range of values assigned to each such
item in the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Statement of Objections,
respectively.

 

(iv) _Fees of the Independent Accountant._ The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant incurred in the resolution of any items in dispute
shall be determined by the Independent Accountant and set forth in its report
and shall be allocated and paid by the party whose calculation of the items in
dispute is furthest from the Independent Accountants determination of
the items in dispute, with any amounts that are payable by Sellers paid out
of the Escrow Amount.

(v) _Determination by Independent Accountant._ The Independent Accountant
shall make a determination as soon as practicable after their engagement, and
their resolution of the Disputed Amounts and their adjustments to the Closing
Working Capital Statement and/or the Post-Closing Adjustment shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

(vi) _Payments of Post-Closing Adjustment._ Except as otherwise provided
herein, any payment of the Post-Closing Adjustment shall (A) be due (x) within
five Business Days of acceptance of the applicable Closing Working Capital
Statement or (y) if there are Disputed Amounts, then within five Business Days
of the resolution described in clause (v) above; and (B) be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account as is directed by
Buyer or Parent, as the case may be.

 

(e) Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made pursuant to Section 2.06
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price by the parties
for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 



35 Section 2.07 Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby shall take place at a closing (the
"Closing") no later than two Business Days after the last of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived (other
than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing
Date) unless this Agreement has been previously terminated pursuant to its
terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties
(the actual date of Closing being referred to herein as the "Closing Date").
The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Closing
through electronic means of communication to avoid the necessity of a physical
Closing. To the extent a physical Closing is required, the Closing shall be
held at the offices of Buchanan Ingersoll and Rooney, PC 301 Grant Street, 20th
floor, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania or at such other location as mutually agreed
upon by Seller Parties and Buyer.

consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the parties
acknowledge that certain Affiliates (including the Seller Parties) will be
required to take certain actions, including, without limitation, the transfer
of certain assets to Buyer at the Closing and the transfer of assets
and Liabilities in order to complete the Reorganization; therefore, Parent
shall cause all such Affiliates to take all reasonable actions that are
required in order to consummate the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and for the Seller Parties to satisfy their respective obligations
set forth in this Agreement.

(i) There has been no amendment to, announcement by any Seller Party or any
Affiliate of Seller Party relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Target Benefit Plan or collective bargaining agreement
that would increase the annual expense of maintaining such plan above the
level of the expense incurred for the most recently completed fiscal year
with respect to any manager, officer, employee, independent contractor or
consultant, as applicable. No Seller Party or any Affiliate of Seller Party
has any commitment or obligation or has made any representations to any
manager, officer, employee, independent contractor or consultant, whether or
not legally binding, to adopt, amend, modify or terminate any Target Benefit
Plan or any collective bargaining agreement.

been administered in compliance with its terms and the operational and
documentary requirements of Section 409A of the Code and all applicable
regulatory guidance (including notices, rulings and proposed and final

"full-time" employees (as those terms are defined in Section 4980H of the Code
and related regulations), or the payment of the applicable penalty, and the
applicable employer information reporting provisions under Sections 6055 and

independent contractor has been properly classified for purposes of
participation and benefit accrual under each Target Benefit Plan.

following the issuance of such Mining Authorization), Buyer shall deliver to
the applicable Governmental Authority, with copy to Sellers, all filings, each
in a form that satisfies all requirements of the applicable Governmental
Authority, that are necessary to cause the applicable Governmental Authority
to recognize and approve of the transfer of the ownership and control of

Target (collectively, the "Permit Transfer Applications"). The parties
acknowledge that some Governmental Authorities may require, among other
things, updated ownership and control information, financial assurance
information and/or the issuance of a new license or mine number and that any
reference herein to a Permit transfer shall also refer to ownership and
control information, financial assurance information and/or issuance of a new

Authorizations of Target during the Transfer Period with respect to the Target
Business and Transferred Business.

(b) Any Permits and Mining Authorizations held by Target with respect to the
Target Business and that are required to be updated and any Amonate Permits
(collectively, the "Transferred Permits") may continue to be utilized by Buyer
or Target after Closing but shall be appropriately approved for transfer or
change in ownership by the Governmental Authorities

 



70  within the Transfer Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Transfer
Period" shall mean the 180 day period following the Closing Date, except that
the period shall be extended, by written notice from Buyer, for an additional
90 days should any Governmental Authority delay processing and approving of a
Permit Transfer Application. Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for any direct
costs incurred by Sellers in connection with the maintenance of such
Transferred Permits from the Closing Date up to and including the date that
such replacements occur.

(c) Additionally, the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to submit and, as applicable, cause their respective Affiliates to
submit within 20 Business Days (or in the case of any Mining Applications
currently under review, as soon as practical following the issuance of such
Mining Authorization) after the Closing, transfer applications to the relevant
Governmental Authorities, and shall thereafter take all other necessary
actions to cause the Permits and Mining Authorizations related to the
Transferred Business that prior to the Closing are owned by a Seller or
Affiliate of Seller (a "Permit Transferor") other than Target to be
transferred to Target or Buyer as expeditiously as possible, including
the Amonate Permits (all such Permits and Mining Authorizations, the
"Affected Permits"), but in any event prior to the expiration of the Transfer
Period. Until the Affected Permits are transferred to Target or Buyer, Buyer
or its designee shall mine the coal on any Real Property subject to the
Affected Permits (the "Affected Real Property") and Target and Buyer will
operate in accordance with, any Affected Permit (the "Affected Business")
as an "operator" pursuant to Section 5.10(e). If any Affected Permit is not
transferred to the Target at least 180 days prior to the expiration date of
such Affected Permit, the Target may, at Buyers sole cost and
expense (including any guarantee or other similar credit support that Target
may reasonably require to backstop any guarantee or other similar credit
support provided by such Permit Transferor), require the Permit Transferor to
expeditiously submit, or cause any subsidiary thereof to submit, renewal
applications for such Affected Permit, including any required increase in
bonds relating to such Affected Permits. If Target exercises this right, the
Permit Transferor shall, at Buyers sole cost and expense, timely submit, and
as required shall cause any subsidiary thereof to submit, minor permit
modifications and amendments as requested by Target from time to time. Upon
issuance of the Affected Permit renewals, the Permit Transferor shall, and
shall cause any applicable subsidiary to, proceed to apply for the transfer of
the Affected Permits to Target, and shall complete the transfer of the
Affected Permit as soon as possible.

 

(d) For as long as Target or any designee thereof operates the Affected
Business on any Affected Real Property as the designated "operator" on behalf
of the Permit Transferor under each Affected Permit pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Affected Permit prior to the transfer of "permittee-
liability" and the issuance of a successor permit, Target shall comply, and
shall cause such designee to comply with all applicable Laws and conditions
of, or pertaining to, the Affected Permits after the Closing, and Buyer shall
indemnify the Permit Transferor and any applicable subsidiary thereof
and hold them harmless from and against all Liabilities incurred or suffered
as a result of Targets or any such designees act or omissions under or with
respect to each Affected Permit. Target or its Affiliates shall have exclusive
control over compliance with the Affected Permit and is hereby authorized to
conduct and perform, in connection with compliance therewith, (i) water
sampling, analysis and reporting, (ii) seven-day inspections of 

 



71  impoundments and other inspections, surveys, and reports related to
impoundments, (iii) annual sediment pond inspections, (iv) emergency plan
updates, and (v) similar matters. At Targets request, the Permit Transferor
shall, and shall cause any applicable subsidiary thereof to, assist Target in
its obligations hereunder.

 

(e) Target shall provide the Permit Transferor prompt written notice of any
"notice of non-compliance," "notice of violation," "cessation order," "notice
of bond forfeiture" or other similar enforcement Action (in any such instance,
a "Notice of Violation") with respect to the Affected Permits after the
Closing and prior to final transfer of the Affected Permits to Target or
Buyer. In the event that any Notice of Violation is issued to the Permit
Transferor or any subsidiary thereof, the Permit Transferor shall provide
Target and Buyer with a copy of the same within three Business Days of the
Permit Transferors or such subsidiarys receipt of such Notice of Violation.
All Liabilities, including all associated Liabilities for remedial work (or
other required work) arising as a result of or relating to any Notice of
Violation or other notice of default or violation under any Affected Permit,
to the extent not resulting from any act or omission of the Permit Transferor,

81  practice that would have the effect of increasing the Tax Liability or
reducing any Tax asset of Buyer or Target in respect of any Post-Closing Tax
Period. Sellers agree that Buyer is to have no Liability for any Tax
resulting from any action of Sellers, their Affiliates or their
Representatives, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer (and, after
the Closing Date, Target) against any such Tax or reduction of any Tax asset.

 

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred

Sellers shall, at their own expense, timely file any Tax Return or other
document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and Buyer shall cooperate with
respect thereto as necessary).

 

(c) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns required to
be filed by Target after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Any such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past

election or any accounting method and shall be submitted by Buyer to
Parent (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by
Parent, supporting documentation) at least 30 days prior to the due date
(including extensions) of such Tax Return. If Parent objects to any item on
any such Tax Return, it shall, within five days after delivery of such Tax
Return, notify Buyer in writing that it so objects, specifying with
particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis
for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered,
Buyer and Parent shall negotiate in good faith and use their reasonable best
efforts to resolve such items. If Buyer and Parent are unable to reach such
agreement within five days after receipt by Buyer of such notice, the
disputed items shall be resolved by the Independent Accountant and any
determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final. The Independent
Accountant shall resolve any disputed items within 20 days of having the item
referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the
Independent Accountant is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due
date for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer
and then amended to reflect the Independent Accountants resolution. The
costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally
by Buyer and Parent. The preparation and filing of any Tax Return of Target
that does not relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be exclusively within

perform, any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation in Article VI; (c)
all Taxes of Target or relating to the Target Business, the Amonate Real

Section 8.05 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
Article VIII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this Article VIII is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party".

 

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice of such
Third Party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party,
to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified
Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense; _provided,_ that if the
Indemnifying Party is a Seller, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to defend or direct the defense of any such Third Party Claim that (x)
is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier or
customer

 



92  of Target, or (y) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 8.05(b), it shall have
the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend,
appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in the
name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the
defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided,_ that if in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, there exists a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects
not to compromise or defend such Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify
the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in
this Agreement, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 8.05(b), pay,
compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any
and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim.
Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects
in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making
available (subject to the provisions of Section 5.09) records relating to such
Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than reimbursement of
actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party, management employees
of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation
of the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
except as provided in this Section 8.05(b). If a firm offer is made to settle
a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all Liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within 10 days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
may assume the defense of such Third Party Claim and in such event, the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall
not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party
fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim
upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim.
If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to Section 8.05(a),
it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). 

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event

 



93  not later than 30 days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such
Direct Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall
describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall indicate the estimated
amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days
after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional
advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the
Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect
of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying
Partys investigation by giving such information and assistance (including
access to Targets premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy
any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so respond within such 30 day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(d) Tax Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
control of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding in respect of Taxes
(including, but not limited to, any such claim in respect of a breach of the
representations and warranties in Section 3.24 hereof or any breach or
violation of or failure to fully perform any covenant, agreement,
undertaking or obligation in Article VI) shall be governed exclusively by
Article VI hereof.

Section 8.06 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within 15 Business Days of
such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. The parties hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party
not make full payment of any such obligations within such 15 Business Day
period, any amount payable shall accrue interest from and including the date
of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable adjudication
to and including the date such payment has been made at a rate per annum equal
to 5%. Such interest shall be calculated daily on the basis of a 365 day year
and the actual number of days elapsed.

Section 8.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the Base Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

 

Section 8.08 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to Section 10.12, the parties
acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud, criminal activity or
willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any

 



94  representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VI and this
Article VIII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and their
Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in Article VI and this Article VIII. Nothing in this Section 8.08 shall
limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any partys
fraudulent, criminal or willful misconduct.

Section 10.06 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,

98 Section 10.07 Entire Agreement.

 

(a) This Agreement together with the Transaction Documents constitute the
entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties
hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

 

(b) Each party acknowledges that the other party(ies) make no representation
or warranty to the other parties except as specifically made in this
Agreement or in any other Transaction Document. In particular, Buyer
acknowledges that except as expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents, Seller Parties make no representation or warranty
to Buyer with respect to (i) the information set forth in the Confidential
Information Memorandum distributed Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the information provided in
any management presentation made in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) any financial projection or forecast relating to
Target, (iv) the mineability, washability, volume, quantity or quality or
recoverability, of coal or reserves in, on or under the Properties or the
feasibility of any mine plans or the marketability or salability of any such
coal from such mines, or (v) the geological or engineering condition of any of
the Properties, including soundness, stability or surface or strata support.
With respect to any such projection or forecast delivered by or on behalf of
Seller Parties to Buyer, Buyer acknowledges that (1) there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such projections and forecasts, (2) Buyer
is familiar with such uncertainties, (3) Buyer is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all such
projections and forecasts so furnished to it, and (4) Buyer shall have no
claim against Seller Parties with respect thereto.

(c) Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
investigation and verification of the financial condition, operations,
assets, Liabilities and properties of Target and the Transferred Business and,
in making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Buyer has relied solely on the results of its
own investigation and verification and the representations and warranties of
Seller Parties set forth in this Agreement, as qualified by the Disclosure
Schedules. THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY SELLER PARTIES SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER PARTIES TO BUYER IN
CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY, AND BUYER
UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED ARE SPECIFICALLY
DISCLAIMED BY SELLER PARTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. With respect
to all materials specifically referenced in this Agreement as having been
delivered or made available to

 



99  Buyer, such materials shall be deemed to have been delivered or made
available to Buyer if such materials were posted to the online data site or
delivered to Buyer at least one Business Day prior to the date of this
Agreement.

Section 10.08 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller may assign its rights to any wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent and Buyer may assign its rights to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer,
provided that no such assignment shall release a party from any of its
obligations hereunder.

Section 10.09 No Third-party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in
Section 6.03 and Article VIII, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 10.10 Amendment and Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may only be
amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each
party hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be
effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so
waiving. No waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in
respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such
written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement
shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.

 

Section 10.11 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction).

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES
AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES

 



100  THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND
(D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS PROVISION.

Section 10.12 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

 

Section 10.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be
deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement
delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic transmission shall
be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed
copy of this Agreement.

Section 10.14 Counsel for Parent.

 

(a) Recognizing that Buchanan Ingersoll and Rooney PC and Steptoe and Johnson PLLC
(collectively "Parent Counsel") have acted as legal counsel to Parent, the
Sellers, the Target and their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing, and
that Parent Counsel intends to act as legal counsel to the Sellers and Parent
after the Closing, each of the Buyer and the Target hereby waives, on its own
behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may
arise in connection with Parent Counsel representing Parent, the Sellers
and/or its Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to
the Buyer, Target or the transactions contemplated herein. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between Parent, the
Sellers and its Affiliates in the course of the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to Parent and the Sellers and
their Affiliates (and not Target). Accordingly, Target shall not have access
to any such communications, or to the files of Parent Counsel relating to
such engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i)
Parent, the Sellers and its Affiliates (and not Target) shall be the sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and
Target shall not be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Parent
Counsel in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only
Parent, the Sellers and its Affiliates (and not Target) shall hold such
property rights, provided that, Target shall continue to have property rights
in and with respect to any files of Parent Counsel that relate to
Parent Counsels representation of Target to the extent such representation
related to the Transferred Business and was not related to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation

 



101  of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) Parent Counsel shall have
no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to Target (other than those files in which Target
retained property rights as noted above) by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Parent Counsel and Target or otherwise.

 

(b) Recognizing that Dinsmore and Shohl LLP (the "Buyer Counsel") have acted as
legal counsel to Buyer, and its Affiliates prior to the Closing and has in
the past acted as counsel to Parent or Affiliates of Parent, and that Buyer
Counsel intends to act as legal counsel to Buyer, Target and their respective
Affiliates after the Closing, Parent hereby waives, on its own behalf and
agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with Buyer Counsel representing Buyer and/or its Affiliates after
the Closing as such representation may relate to the Buyer, Target or the
transactions contemplated herein.

Section 10.15 Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules have been
arranged for purposes of convenience in separately numbered sections
corresponding to the sections of this Agreement; however, any item disclosed
in any part, subpart, section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule
referenced by a particular section or subsection in this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other section and
subsection in this Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure to such other
section or subsection is reasonably apparent on its face, notwithstanding
the omission of an appropriate cross-reference. Any item of information,
matter or document disclosed or referenced in, or attached to, the Disclosure
Schedules shall not (a) be used as a basis for interpreting the terms
"material", "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this
Agreement or to establish a standard of materiality, (b) represent a
determination that such item or matter did not arise in the ordinary course of
business, (c) be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the
representations and warranties contained in Article III, or the obligations,
covenants, conditions or agreements contained herein, (d) constitute, or be
deemed to constitute, an admission of liability or obligation regarding such
matter, (e) constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an admission to any third
party concerning such item or matter or (f) constitute, or be deemed to
constitute, an admission or indication by the a Seller Party that such item
meets any or all of the criteria set forth in this Agreement for inclusion in
the Disclosure Schedules. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules relating
to any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed
as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedules and not
otherwise defined therein have the meanings given to them in this Agreement.
