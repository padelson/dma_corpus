# ARTICLE 2

   

# PURCHASE AND SALE; CLOSING

   

# 2.1 Sale of Sold Shares

   

 Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing the Purchaser will purchase the Sold Shares from the Vendor for the Purchase Price and pay the Purchase Price to the Vendor (or one or more Persons designated by the Vendor) and the Vendor will sell, assign and deliver the Sold Shares to the Purchaser against receipt of payment of the Purchase Price. 

   

# 2.2 Purchase Price and Payment

          | (a)   |   The Purchaser will pay to the Vendor or as the
Vendor designates, in the manner  required by Section 2.2(b), the amount (as
calculated and adjusted in accordance  with this Agreement, the "Purchase
Price") that is the sum of:   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (i)   |   Six Hundred and Eighty-Six Million
($686,000,000) Dollars (the  "Unadjusted Consideration") less the aggregate
of (A) the  amount of the Intercorporate Debt at the time of Closing, (B) the
Canadian  Equivalent of the CSFB Debt at the time of Closing, and (C) all
Indebtedness for  Borrowed Money at the time of Closing (such difference, the
"Share  Purchase Price"); _plus_ ,   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (ii)   |   the Working Capital and Other Amount and, for
clarity, if the Working Capital  and Other Amount is a negative amount, then
the addition of such amount will  have the effect of decreasing the Purchase
Price; _plus_ ,   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (iii)   |   the Closing Adjustment and, for clarity, if
the Closing Adjustment is a negative  amount, then the addition of such
amount will have the effect of decreasing the  Purchase Price.   
---|---|--- 
    
       |  The components of the Purchase Price will be determined for
the purpose of Closing according to the Closing Estimate under Section 2.4.
  
---|--- 
   
          | (b)   |   The Purchase Price will be paid by the
Purchaser at the Closing by:   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (i)   |   confirmed wire transfer in immediately
available funds to such bank accounts as  are designated for such purpose by
the Vendor and advised by the Vendor to the  Purchaser, such designation to
be delivered no later than five (5) Business Days  before the Closing Date;
or   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (ii)   |   such other means as are agreed upon by the
Vendor and the Purchaser.   
---|---|--- 
    
   

# 2.3 Repayment of Certain Debt

   

 _ Immediately following the Closing:_

        (a)  |   the Purchaser will capitalize the Sold Company with
sufficient funds (either  debt or equity or a combination of debt and equity
as the Purchaser chooses) to  enable the Sold Company to repay, and ensure
that the Sold Company repays, at  par and at that time, the Intercorporate
Debt at the time of Closing and the  Canadian Equivalent of the CSFB Debt at
the time of Closing in the amount  determined initially according to the
Closing Estimate under Section 2.4,  by:   
---|--- 
    
        (i)  |   confirmed wire transfer in immediately available funds
to such bank accounts as  are designated for such purpose by the Vendor and
advised by the Vendor to the  Purchaser such designation to be delivered no
later than five (5) Business Days  before the Closing Date; or   
---|--- 
    
        (ii)  |   such other means as are agreed upon by the Vendor and
the Purchaser; and   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   the Vendor will cause valid receipts for the amounts
so repaid to be delivered  to the Sold Company, together with, in respect of
all of the Sold Companys  liability to each applicable creditor under or in
relation to the credit and  other arrangements respecting the Intercorporate
Debt and the CSFB Debt,  discharges of liability, cancelled promissory notes,
where applicable, and  terminations of the applicable credit documentation
and discharges of Security  Interests, if any, in each case duly signed by
the applicable creditors, against  receipt of the payments under Section
2.3(a).   
---|--- 
    
   

# 2.4 Estimate of Purchase Price and Debt

   

 Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed Closing Date, the Vendor will provide the Purchaser an estimate, prepared in good faith in substantially the form of Annex 2.4 and attaching, and (where applicable) based upon, the draft financial statements of the Sold Company (on an estimated basis) at the time of Closing (the "Closing Estimate"), of 

        (a)  |   the amounts of the Intercorporate Debt at the time of
Closing, the Canadian  Equivalent of the CSFB Debt at the time of Closing and
the Indebtedness for  Borrowed Money at the time of Closing, together with
payout statements from the  creditors in respect of the Intercorporate Debt,
the CSFB Debt and the  Indebtedness for Borrowed Money as to the amounts
owing thereunder at the time  of Closing;   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   the Working Capital and Other Amount; and   
---|--- 
    
        (c)  |   the Closing Adjustment;   
---|--- 
    
   

setting forth each item in reasonable detail and with appropriate back-up,
and the resulting Purchase Price.

   

# 2.5 Final Calculations of Purchase Price and Debt

        (a)  |   At the time that it delivers the draft Tax returns and
financial statements as  at and for the period ended on the Closing Date
under Sections 7.3(c) and  7.3(e), the Vendor will deliver to the Purchaser a
further good faith  calculation of (i) the Working Capital and Other Amount,
(ii) the  amount of the Intercorporate Debt at the time of Closing, the
Canadian  Equivalent of the CSFB Debt at the time of Closing and all
Indebtedness for  Borrowed Money at the time of Closing and (iii) the Closing
Adjustment, in  substantially the form of the Closing Estimate, except
attaching, and (where  applicable) based upon, the draft financial statements
delivered by the Vendor  under Section 7.3(e), and with appropriate back-up
information (the  "Calculation"). The Calculation must accurately reflect
all  relevant information then in the possession of or available to the
Vendor that  may affect the amounts therein.   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   The Purchaser will notify the Vendor in writing if it
has any objections to the  Calculation (including inadequacy of information
or inability to verify the  Calculation). The Purchaser will be deemed to
have accepted the Calculation, and  the Calculation will be deemed to be
finalized, if the Purchaser does not give  the Vendor notice of its
objections (which must be made in good faith) within  sixty (60) days from
the date of receipt of the Calculation. A notice of  objection must contain a
statement of the basis of the Purchasers  objections (which may be
inadequacy of information or inability to verify) and  each amount in
dispute. An objection based on inadequacy of information or  inability to
verify must identify the additional information the Purchaser feels  it needs
with reasonable particularity. The Vendor will, upon reasonable  request,
provide access to the Purchaser and its advisors, to all relevant books  and
records, with the right to take copies of the relevant information, and to 
the appropriate personnel, for the sole purpose of verifying the Calculation.
  
---|--- 
    
        (c)  |   If the Purchaser makes a good faith objection based on
inadequacy of information  or inability to verify and requests additional
information pursuant to paragraph  (b) above, the Purchaser will be deemed to
have accepted the Calculation, and  the Calculation will be deemed to be
finalized, if the Purchaser does not give  the Vendor notice of its
objections (which must be made in good faith) within  fifteen (15) Business
Days from the date of receipt of the additional  information.   
---|--- 
    
        (d)  |   If the Purchaser timely makes good faith objections to
the Calculation, the  Purchaser and the Vendor will work expeditiously and in
good faith to resolve  the matters in dispute within a period of ten (10)
Business Days after the date  of notification by the Purchaser to the Vendor
of its objections. If the  Purchaser and the Vendor cannot resolve their
dispute within such period, the  dispute will be submitted for determination
to PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP. The  determination of PriceWaterhouseCoopers
LLP of the matters in dispute will be  final and binding upon the Parties and
will not be subject to appeal, absent  manifest error. PriceWaterhouseCoopers
LLP will be deemed to be acting as  experts and not as arbitrators. The
procedure to be followed by the Parties with  respect to the determination
will be determined by PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP,  in its sole discretion.
Each Party will provide PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP  access to all relevant
books and records and to the appropriate personnel to  assist it in the
determination of the final Calculation.   
---|--- 
    
        (e)  |   The Vendor and the Purchaser will each bear the fees
and expenses of their  respective personnel or advisors in preparing or
reviewing the Calculation and,  if applicable, their respective costs in
presenting their cases to  PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP. In the case of the
retention of  PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP to determine a dispute, the costs
and expenses of  PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP will be borne equally by the
Vendor and the  Purchaser.   
---|--- 
    
        (f)  |   If the Indebtedness for Borrowed Money at the time of
Closing according to the  Calculation as finalized in accordance with this
Section 2.5, _minus_ the  Indebtedness for Borrowed Money according to the
Closing Estimate, is:   
---|--- 
    
        (i)  |   a positive amount, then the Vendor will pay the
difference to the Purchaser; or   
---|--- 
    
        (ii)  |   a negative amount, then the Purchaser will pay the
difference to the Vendor,  _plus_ ,   
---|--- 
    
       |  (in either case) interest on the amount payable from the
Closing Date to the date of payment at the Prime Rate from time to time in
effect. Such amount must be paid within two (2) Business Days after
finalization of the Calculation.   
---|--- 
   
        (g)  |   If the aggregate of the Working Capital and Other
Amount and the Closing  Adjustment at the time of Closing according to the
Calculation as finalized in  accordance with this Section 2.5, _minus_ the
aggregate of the Working  Capital and Other Amount and the Closing Adjustment
according to the Closing  Estimate is:   
---|--- 
    
        (i)  |   a positive amount, then the Purchaser will pay the
difference to the Vendor; or   
---|--- 
    
        (ii)  |   a negative amount, then the Vendor will pay the
difference to the Purchaser,  _plus_ ,   
---|--- 
    
       |  (in either case) interest on the amount payable from the
Closing Date to the date of payment at the Prime Rate from time to time in
effect. Such amount must be paid within two (2) Business Days after
finalization of the Calculation.   
---|--- 
   
          | (h)   |   If the aggregate of the Intercorporate Debt at
the time of Closing and the  Canadian Equivalent of the CSFB Debt at the time
of Closing, according to the  Calculation as finalized in accordance with
this Section 2.5, _minus_ the  aggregate of those items according to the
Closing Estimate, is:   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (i)   |   a positive amount, then the Purchaser will
cause the Sold Company to pay the  difference to the applicable creditor or,
in the case of the Intercorporate  Debt, as otherwise designated by the
Vendor and the Vendor will pay an equal  amount to the Purchaser as a
reduction of the Share Purchase Price; or   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (ii)   |   a negative amount, then the Vendor will ensure
that the applicable creditor will  pay the difference to the Sold Company and
the Purchaser will pay an equal  amount to the Vendor as an increase of the
Share Purchase Price, _plus_ ,   
---|---|--- 
    
       |  (in either case) interest on the amount payable from the
Closing Date to the date of payment at the higher of (A) the contractual rate
of interest on the applicable Intercorporate Debt or the CSFB Debt, as
applicable, or (B) the Prime Rate from time to time in effect. Such amount
must be paid within two (2) Business Days after finalization of
the Calculation.   
---|--- 
   
   

# 2.6 Time and Place of Closing

        (a)  |   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the Closing will  take place at the Place of Closing at 10:00 a.m.
(Mountain Time) on the Closing  Date.   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   The Purchaser is responsible for satisfying the
conditions to Closing in Section  2.10; the Vendor is responsible for
satisfying the conditions to Closing in  Section 2.9; and both Parties will
use commercially reasonable efforts to  satisfy the conditions to Closing in

Authorities having jurisdiction over  pensions, (ii) the assets, including
any surplus, in such pension plan are  held by the trustee or funding agent
thereof for the benefit of such  employees entitlements, (iii) the Sold

benefits of, such pension  plan and the agreements related thereto and under
any related agreements under  the TransAlta Sale Documentation and all
responsibility for benefit  calculations, communications and reporting
thereunder. Except as provided in the  preceding sentence, the pension plan
referred to therein will not be amended  prior to the Closing.

it under Section 5.5(d) or  (e). After Closing, the Vendor will and will
ensure the applicable Affiliate  will, at the expense of the Sold Company,
cooperate with the Sold Company in the  pursuit of the Claim.   
---|--- 
    
        (c)  |   If, before Closing, any destruction, loss or damage of

will ensure the applicable Affiliate will,  at the expense of the Sold
Company, but subject to Sections 5.5(d) and (e), (i)  cooperate with the Sold
Company in filing a claim under the policy in respect of  the destruction,
loss, damage or claim, and in the pursuit of the claim, and, if  applicable,

insurance as contemplated by  Section 5.5(b) or (c) and both the Sold Company
and the Vendor or any Affiliate  other than the Sold Company is a party to
the third party Claim, then any  insurance proceeds recovered in respect of
the claim will be applied, firstly,  to reimburse the Vendor or such
Affiliate for the costs of pursuing the Claim or  defending any third party
action, secondly, to any Claims against or suffered by  the Vendor or such
Affiliate and, thirdly, any excess to the Sold Company.   
---|--- 
    
        (e)  |   In respect of any claim contemplated by Section 5.5(b)

saves harmless the Vendor or  applicable Affiliate from and against any and
all Claims suffered, incurred or  sustained in making or pursuing the claim,
(ii) neither the Vendor nor any such  Affiliate will be required to take any
step or action involving the expenditure  of funds or exposure to liability
unless it is indemnified to its satisfaction  (both as to the identity and
creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the  scope and terms of the
indemnity), and (iii) neither the Vendor nor any  Affiliate will be required
to take any step or action that is reasonably  expected to involve
significant commitments of time by its employees unless it  is compensated
for the loss of time of such employees and the time expenditure  is
convenient to it in relation to the employees duties.   
---|--- 
    
        (f)  |   If, before Closing (i) any destruction, loss or damage
occurs of or to the  Assets that, after giving effect to the receipt of
insurance proceeds reasonably  expected to be obtained by the Sold Company as
a result of the event, would  reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect (for clarity, including  any destruction, loss or damage
described in Section 5.5(b) that has such  effect) and the applicable Assets
cannot be repaired, replaced or restored by  the Closing Date by assets of
equal value and utility or (ii) any part of the  Assets is seized by a
Government Authority and, after giving effect to the  receipt of proceeds of
taking reasonably expected to be obtained by the Sold  Company as a result of
the event, such seizure would reasonably be expected to  have a Material
Adverse Effect and the applicable Asset cannot be replaced by  the Closing
Date by assets of equal value and utility, then, in either case, the  Vendor
will forthwith give to the Purchaser written notice including reasonable 
particulars thereof and of any insurance proceeds or proceeds of taking
expected  to be obtained by the Sold Company.

        (i)  |   complete the transactions contemplated hereby without
reduction of the Purchase  Price, in which event all proceeds of insurance or
compensation for destruction,  loss, damage or seizure of the Sold Companys
assets will be paid directly  to the Sold Company or, if received by the
Vendor or an Affiliate other than the  Sold Company, paid to the Sold Company
promptly on receipt and, for clarity, the  amount of the PPandE will be
adjusted to reflect the uninsured or  uncompensated portion of such
destruction, loss, damage or seizure; or   
---|--- 
    
        (ii)  |   terminate this Agreement and not complete the
transactions contemplated hereby  and in such event the Vendor and the

# ARTICLE 7

   

# GENERAL COVENANTS CONCERNING THE SOLD COMPANY

   

# AND THE ELECTRICITY BUSINESS

   

# 7.1 Insurance

   

 The Purchaser acknowledges Section 5.5. After 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, the Purchaser will ensure that the Sold Company will procure and maintain such policies of insurance and surety bonds related to the Assets as the Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, deems advisable. After the Closing Date, the Vendor will not have any responsibility or duty to administer, in any fashion, claims under any insurance policies with respect to the Sold Companys assets, except in accordance with Section 5.5. 

   

# 7.2 General Covenants of the Purchaser

   

 After Closing, the Purchaser will cause the Sold Company to, among other things: 

        (a)  |   conduct the Business in accordance with Good Industry
Practice, Applicable Laws  and all Authorizations that are applicable
thereto;   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   obtain and at all times maintain in force the
Authorizations necessary to permit  the Sold Company to conduct the Business;
and

TransAlta Purchase Documentation  and the EPCOR Sale Documentation,   
---|--- 
    
   

where and to the extent failure to do so would reasonably be expected to
result in a Claim against the Vendor or any Affiliate.

   

# 7.3 Tax Returns and Financial Statements

        (a)  |   The Vendor will, at the expense of the Sold Company,
prepare all federal and  provincial returns of Taxes and applicable schedules
for the Sold Company for  its taxation years that end prior to the Closing
Date, in accordance with the  ITA or applicable provincial Tax legislation
and regulations, within the time  prescribed thereby, and, if the time for
filing such returns or paying such  Taxes is before the Closing, cause the
Sold Company to file such returns or pay  any Taxes indicated on them as
owing, as applicable. If the time for filing such  returns or paying such
Taxes is after the Closing, the Purchaser will cause the  Sold Company to
file such returns and pay the Taxes indicated on them as owing,  as
applicable.   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   The Vendor will provide to the Purchaser copies of
returns of Taxes and related  schedules and accompanying financial statements
promptly after they are  available under Section 7.3(a).   
---|--- 
    
        (c)  |   The Vendor will, at its expense, prepare and deliver
to the Purchaser, not later  than sixty (60) days after Closing, draft
federal and provincial income Tax  returns and applicable schedules for the
Sold Company for its taxation year that  begins on the January 1 preceding
the Closing Date and ends on the Closing Date,  in accordance with the ITA or
applicable provincial Tax legislation and  regulations.   
---|--- 
    
        (d)  |   The Purchaser will cause the returns prepared and
delivered pursuant to Section  7.3(c) to be duly filed within the time
prescribed by the ITA or provincial Tax  legislation and regulations, as
applicable, and cause the Sold Company to pay  any Taxes indicated on such
returns as owing except that if the Purchaser,  acting reasonably, disagrees
with any entry or calculation made in such returns  or believes they are not
most advantageous to the Sold Company, then it must  advise the Vendor no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the time that such  returns must be
filed and the Vendor and the Purchaser will meet to resolve any  dispute and
cooperate to resolve the differences as soon as practicable. If as a  result
of changes proposed by the Purchaser to the Tax returns prepared by the 
Vendor, the Working Capital and Other Amount is lower (including a larger 
negative amount) than it would be using the returns prepared by the Vendor
and  such difference is not a result of manifest errors made by the Vendor,
the  Working Capital and Other Amount will be calculated using the amount of
Taxes  according to the returns prepared by the Vendor and the Vendors 
responsibility for Excess Taxes under Section 11.5 will be determined using 
such amount of Taxes.   
---|--- 
    
        (e)  |   At the time it delivers the draft Tax returns under
Section 7.3(c), the Vendor  will prepare and deliver to the Purchaser drafts
of the financial statements,  including a statement of income, statement of
changes in financial position,  statement of retained earning and balance
sheet, of the Sold Company as at or  for the period that begins on the
January 1 preceding the Closing Date and ends  on the Closing Date prepared
in accordance with GAAP. The Vendor will further  provide to the Purchaser,
on request from time to time, such explanations and  data with respect to
such financial statements as the Purchaser may reasonably  request.   
---|--- 
    
   

# 7.4 Post Closing Access

   

 The Vendor may retain copies of the Sold Companys books and records for the purpose of dealing with matters occurring up to the time of Closing. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Purchaser will for a period of seven (7) years following Closing, to the extent necessary in connection with any Tax or other appropriate matter relating to the Sold Company or the Business for any period prior to the time of Closing and specifically to permit the Vendor to discharge its obligations under Sections 2.5, 7.3 and 11.5 at the sole cost and expense of the Vendor: 

        (a)  |   permit the Vendor or its agents, representatives or
advisors to inspect and take  copies of all books or records, including
financial information, of the Sold  Company with regard to any period prior
to the Closing; and   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   assist in arranging discussions with (and calling as
witnesses) officers,  directors, employees and agents of the Sold Company,
the Purchaser or its other  Affiliates.   
---|--- 
    
   

# 7.5 Use of Name

   

 _ The Purchaser will:_

        (a)  |   within 15 days of the Closing Date, cause the name of
the Sold Company to be  changed to a name that does not include the name
"Aquila"; and   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   cause the Sold Company and the Purchasers other
Affiliates to cease using  the name "Aquila" or any derivation of it or any
name that includes it  and the Aquila trade marks and logos as promptly as
reasonably practicable after  Closing, provided that with respect to
correspondence related to the Business,  the Sold Company may indicate that
it is the successor by change of name to  Aquila Networks Canada (Alberta)
Ltd. for a period of up to 2 years after  Closing, but not thereafter.   
---|--- 
    
   

# 7.6 Compliance with Law

   

 Both before and after Closing, the Vendor may (i) take such actions, at its own cost and expense, as shall be reasonably necessary to comply with its obligations pursuant to Applicable Laws and Authorizations, or (ii) make any application, give notice, or take any action under or in relation to any legal or regulatory proceedings, provided that prior to Closing the Vendor will comply with Article 6\. 

   

# 7.7 Handling of Certain Agreements

   

 The Purchaser acknowledges the existence of agreements, instruments and employee benefit plans or programs (including the lease agreements relating to the Sold Companys corporate headquarters and data warehouse located in Calgary) relating principally to the business and affairs of the Sold Company, the "Sold Company" under the Other Share Purchase Agreement, or both, that have been entered into or created under the "Aquila Networks Canada" trade name or a trade name using the name "UtiliCorp" or entered into by the Vendor, or that otherwise may not clearly reflect that the Sold Company is a party thereto or an obligor thereunder, or under which the Vendor or one or more of its other Affiliates may have liability as an obligor or co-obligor. With respect to such agreements, instruments and employee benefit plans and programs and in addition to the obligations under Section 2.12(c): 

        (a)  |   prior to the Closing, the Vendor will cause the
benefit thereof to be assigned  to the Sold Company; and   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   until the Sold Company has been recognized by
applicable third parties to such  agreements, instruments, plans and programs
the Vendor or applicable Affiliate  will agree to enforce them at the
request, risk and expense of the Sold Company;  provided that the Vendor or
such Affiliate will not be required to take any step  in relation to
enforcement unless it is indemnified to its satisfaction in  respect of any
liabilities that may be incurred by it in so doing;   
---|--- 
    
        (c)  |   the Purchaser from and after Closing will indemnify
and save harmless the Vendor  and its other Affiliates from and against any
and all Claims relating thereto or  arising therefrom, but (i) only to the
extent such Claims relate to the Business  and affairs of the Sold Company
and (ii) with respect to any such agreement,  instrument, or employee benefit
plan or program that is material, only if it is  included in the Data Room;
and   
---|--- 
    
        (d)  |   the Purchaser agrees to cooperate with the Vendor in
any effort by the Vendor to  obtain appropriate releases of the Vendor and
its other Affiliates under such  agreements, instruments, or employee benefit
plans or programs or otherwise to  clarify or confirm the appropriate
allocation of liabilities thereunder among  the Vendor, the Sold Company and
the Vendors other Affiliates.   
---|--- 
    
   

# 7.8 CSFB Debt Withholding Tax Recovery

   

 If the Sold Company recovers any money on account of the CSFB Debt or withholding Taxes in respect thereof, the Purchaser will cause that money to be paid to the Vendor promptly after receipt thereof, and with respect to withholding Taxes, only to the extent such amounts exceed the amount accrued on the balance sheet relating to such withholding Taxes. 

   

# 7.9 Regulatory Cooperation

   

 For a period of three (3) years after Closing, the Vendor will, at the Sold Companys cost and on its reasonable request, provide information that is in the possession of the Vendor in relation to regulatory applications or matters pertaining to the Sold Company. 

   

# ARTICLE 8

   

# REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY MATTERS PRIOR TO CLOSING

   

# 8.1 Defects to be Identified

          | (a)   |   If at any time and from time to time, before
the scheduled Closing Date or, if  not scheduled, the Outside Date, the
Purchaser considers that one or more  representations or warranties made by
the Vendor and not the subject of a prior  Representation Notice was, in one
or more respects, not true when made or will  not be true at Closing (a "RandW
Defect") and that the Defect  Amount attributable to the RandW Defect exceeds
$100,000 and the Purchaser is  not prepared to waive such RandW Defect, then
the Purchaser must promptly give  notice of the RandW Defect to the Vendor (a
"Representation  Notice"); provided that a misrepresentation or breach of
warranty in  Section 3.1(a), 3.2(a) to (e) inclusive, 3.3(a) or 3.4(a) will
only be dealt  with under this Article 8 if the Purchaser so chooses in its
sole  discretion. The Representation Notice must (i) unless the Purchaser
has  previously given notice of the RandW Defect to the Vendor, identify in 
reasonable detail the nature and description of the RandW Defect; (ii) 
estimate the Defect Amount attributable to the RandW Defect, and (iii) 
indicate how such Defect Amount was determined. For clarity, no
Representation  Notice may be given in respect of any single alleged
misrepresentation or breach  of warranty unless in the one or more respects
it is alleged there is such a  misrepresentation or breach of warranty, it
would reasonably be expected to have  or result in a Defect Amount of at
least $100,000.   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (b)   |   Promptly on, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days of, receipt of a  Representation Notice, the Vendor must advise
the Purchaser whether it agrees  that the matters described therein
constitute RandW Defects and with the  Purchasers calculation of the Defect
Amounts and, if not, of the reasons  for its disagreement. If the Vendor
disagrees with the Purchasers  calculation of the Defect Amounts, the
Vendors advice must set out a  determination of the Defect Amounts and an
indication of how such Defect Amounts  were determined.   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (c)   |   If with respect to any RandW Defect for which a
Representation Notice has been  properly given:   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (i)   |   the subject-matter of the applicable
representation or warranty is true or  otherwise cured on or before the
Outside Date, or   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (ii)   |   the Purchaser waives the condition to Closing
requiring such representation or  warranty to be true, or   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (iii)   |   the RandW Defect has been reflected in a
reduction of the Defect Threshold  Amount and the Indemnity Threshold Amount,
the Defect Allowance or the Share  Purchase Price under Section 8.2(c),   
---|---|--- 
    
   

 _ then_

        (iv)  |   if (i) above applies, the Vendor will confirm on
Closing that the applicable  representation or warranty is accurate in all
material respects on the Closing  Date but need not certify that it was
accurate at the date hereof;   
---|--- 
    
        (v)  |   if (ii) or (iii) applies, the Vendor need not confirm
its accuracy at all; and   
---|--- 
    
        (vi)  |   if (i), (ii) or (iii) applies, then subject to the
other terms and conditions  hereof, the Parties will complete the Closing and
in any such case, neither the  RandW Defect nor the misrepresentation or breach
of warranty forming the basis  thereof may form the subject-matter of any
Claim hereunder nor may any action or  proceeding (whether by way of
statement of claim, originating notice, motion,  defence, counterclaim, third
party notice or otherwise) be brought or enforced  nor may any remedy or
relief be sought by the Purchaser for or in respect  thereof.   
---|--- 
    
        (d)  |   If with respect to any RandW Defect the Defect Amount is
determined to have  been less than $100,000, neither the RandW Defect nor the
misrepresentation or  breach of warranty forming the basis thereof may form
the subject-matter of any  Claim hereunder nor may any action or proceeding
(whether by way of statement of  claim, originating notice, motion, defence,
counterclaim, third party notice or  otherwise) be brought or enforced nor
may any remedy or relief be sought by the  Purchaser for or in respect
thereof.   
---|--- 
    
   

# 8.2 Curing Defects; Valuation and Adjustment

          | (a)   |   If a Representation Notice is timely given, the
Vendor will use commercially  reasonable efforts to remedy the matters that
it agrees constitute RandW  Defects and that are remediable as soon as possible
after being notified  thereof. If the Vendor does not remedy and the
Purchaser does not waive all  alleged RandW Defects (those that remain
unremedied and unwaived, the  "Uncured Defects") or the Parties have not
agreed on whether  the matters constitute RandW Defects or the Defect Amount
thereof by the  Outside Date the dispute will be submitted for determination
to the business  valuation services of PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP (the 
"Evaluator").   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (b)   |   Within three (3) days of appointment of the
Evaluator, each Party must provide  to the other Party and, at the same time,
to the Evaluator a written statement  separately setting forth its
determination of the matters in dispute with  respect to alleged RandW Defects
in the Representation Notice and Defect  Amounts thereof, together with
written instructions that:   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (i)   |   the Evaluator, to the extent that it may be
necessary, may engage legal counsel  or other experts qualified by education
and experience to advise the Evaluator  on the matters in dispute with
respect to alleged RandW Defects, including  existence, extent or valuation
thereof;   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (ii)   |   for all RandW Defects related to a particular
Section, the Evaluator, in  accordance with good valuation practices, must
select, on the basis of  reasonableness, either the determination of all
matters in dispute with respect  to such alleged RandW Defects submitted by one
Party or the determination of  all matters in dispute with respect to such
alleged RandW Defects submitted by  the other Party, based only upon the
written statements submitted by them and  the Evaluators training,
experience or expert advice. For clarity, the  Evaluator must select either
the Purchasers determination of all matters  in dispute with respect to
alleged RandW Defects related to a particular  Section or the Vendors
determination of all matters in dispute with  respect to such alleged RandW
Defects and is not entitled to propose a  compromise settlement or to pick
one Partys determination of some of the  matters in dispute with respect to
alleged RandW Defects under a particular  Section and the other Partys
determination of the balance of them;   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (iii)   |   the preceding paragraph (ii) must be followed
for each Section in respect of  which there are RandW Defects; and   
---|---|--- 
    
          | (iv)   |   such evaluation must be completed within
twenty (20) Business Days from the date  of submission.   
---|---|--- 
    
       |  The fees and other costs to be paid to the Evaluator in
respect to the services performed by it are to be paid in equal shares by the
Vendor and the Purchaser. If a Party fails to provide a written statement to
an Evaluator together with its written instructions as set out herein, then
the Evaluator must select the other Partys determination and, subject to
Section 8.2(c) and to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
precedent herein, the Closing will occur.   
---|--- 
   
        (c)  |   Upon the determination or agreement as to the matters
in dispute with respect to  alleged RandW Defects in a Representation Notice:
  
---|--- 
    
        (i)  |   if the aggregate of the Defect Amounts in respect of
such Representation Notice  is less than the Defect Threshold Amount (as
previously reduced, if applicable,  in respect of all other Representation
Notices), the Defect Threshold Amount (as  so reduced) and the Indemnity
Threshold Amount (as previously reduced, if  applicable, in respect of all
other Representation Notices) as it applies to the  indemnity by the Vendor
under Section 11.2(a) will be reduced by the aggregate  of such Defect
Amounts and the Purchaser will complete the purchase of the Sold  Shares
without allocation to the Defect Allowance or reduction of the Share 
Purchase Price;   
---|--- 
    
        (ii)  |   if the aggregate of the Defect Amounts in respect of
such Representation Notice  is equal to or greater than the Defect Threshold
Amount (as previously reduced,  if applicable, in respect of all other

officers, employees, agents,  consultants, representatives or advisors except
if the event giving rise to the  right to terminate under Section 10.1 or
giving rise to the non-occurrence  of Closing in the case of automatic

damages, costs and expenses (including loss of  bargain and loss of
opportunity and reasonable counsel fees) in respect of such  damages, costs

Claim as a result of such  failure;   
---|---

Applicable Law to commence such contest, and  provided that the Indemnifying
Party has acknowledged to the Claiming Party that  the Indemnified Claim is
covered by the indemnity herein, the Claiming Party  must at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party in good faith contest the  validity, applicability or
the amount of such Indemnified Claim by all  reasonable proceedings or, at

or otherwise) in respect of the Indemnified Claim as  instructed by the
Indemnifying Party from time to time;   
---|--- 
    
        (c)  |   where the Indemnified Claim is a claim by a third
party, in the event of any  contest of any Indemnified Claim, whether by the
Indemnifying Party or the  Claiming Party, the other Party must provide all
such assistance, including  access to documents and officers and employees,
as may be requested by the Party  conducting the contestation of the
Indemnified Claim and the other Party shall  be entitled (at its own expense)
to be represented by separate counsel in the  contestation;   
---|--- 
    
        (d)  |   where the Indemnified Claim is a claim by a third
party, neither Party may  settle or agree to pay or, if the settlement
contestation of such Indemnified  Claim is not in the control of the Party,
exercise any rights to vote (by ballot  or otherwise) in favour of a
settlement or agreement to pay, the Indemnified  Claim without the consent of
the other, such consent not to be unreasonably  withheld; and   
---|--- 
    
        (e)  |   where the Indemnified Claim is a claim by a third
party, if the Indemnifying  Party has paid an amount in respect of an
Indemnified Claim pursuant hereto,  then (i) the Indemnifying Party will be
subrogated to all and any Claims which  the Claiming Party may have relating
thereto without any further action; (ii)  the Claiming Party, without
limiting its rights to the indemnity herein, must  give such further
assurances and agreements and cooperate with the Indemnifying  Party to
permit the Indemnifying Party to pursue such Claims as and when  requested by
the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) if the Claiming Party is  subsequently
reimbursed from any source in respect of the Indemnified Claim from  any
other Person, the Claiming Party must promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party 
such amounts received, including interest actually received attributable 
thereto.

of the Tax Issue. The Purchaser will,  or will cause the Sold Company to,
forward amounts so received from the Vendor  to the Tax Authority on account

contestation related to the Tax Issue.

---|--- 
    
        (g)  |   The Purchaser will and will cause the Sold Company to
cooperate with any  reasonable requests of the Vendor for information and
assistance in relation to  any Tax Issue or Proceeding and permit the Vendor

executed any document necessary, reasonable  and appropriate to enable the
Vendor to so defend, object, oppose or contest.   
---|--- 
    
        (h)  |   For clarity, the Vendor will, in the carriage of any
Tax Issue or Proceeding,  have discretion to agree to a compromise or
settlement that reduces or increases  Taxes otherwise payable and to which
the indemnity in this Section 11.5 applies  by increasing or decreasing
claims made by the Sold Company against balances of  undepreciated capital
cost ("UCC") of the Sold Company in respect of  the relevant taxation year
provided that if it does so, then the Vendor must  compensate the Purchaser
or the Purchaser must compensate the Vendor, as  applicable, for the value of
the reduction or increase in the applicable Classes  of UCC of the Sold
Company that results. Value of the reduction or increase of  Classes of UCC
will be the product of the amount of the reduction or increase,  as
applicable, and the following percentages:   
---|--- 
    
        (i)  |   for Class 1: 10%;   
---|--- 
    
        (ii)  |   for Class 2: 13%;   
---|--- 
    
        (iii)  |   for Class 8: 24%;   
---|--- 
    
        (iv)  |   for Class 10: 27%; and   
---|--- 
    
        (v)  |   for Class 12: 31%.   
---|--- 
    
        (i)  |   The Vendor is not responsible for any payments that
would otherwise be payable  hereunder to the extent the liability for Taxes
is attributable to the refusal,  delay or neglect of the Purchaser to observe
and perform its obligations  hereunder.   
---|--- 
    
        (j)  |   The obligations of the Vendor and the rights of the
Purchaser under this  Section 11.5 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Purchaser after  Closing in respect of the representation and warranty of
the Vendor in  Section 3.7(e) or any other matter herein in respect of Taxes
for taxation  years of the Sold Company ending on or prior to the Closing
Date.   
---|--- 
    
        (k)  |   Should the Vendor or the Purchaser fail to pay any
amounts owing to the other  under this Section 11.5 within the time
stipulated for payment thereof, interest  at the Prime Rate from time to time
in effect shall be paid by the Party owing  such amount on the unpaid amount
from the date due until paid in full.   
---|--- 
    
        (l)  |   Any payment made hereunder by the Vendor or by the
Purchaser will be an  adjustment to the Share Purchase Price. Accordingly,
any such payment by (i) the  Vendor is a decrease, or (ii) by the Purchaser
is an increase, of the Share  Purchase Price.   
---|--- 
    
   

# 11.6 Limitations on Indemnity and Liability

        (a)  |   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, neither  Party will be liable hereunder for any damages,
costs, expenses, injuries,  losses or other liabilities of an indirect,
special or consequential nature  suffered by the Claiming Party or claimed by
any third party against the  Claiming Party or any exemplary or punitive
damages, costs or expenses suffered  by the Claiming Party.   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   The indemnity obligations of the Parties under Section
11.2 do not apply to, and  no Claim may be brought thereunder in respect of,
any matters related to the  finalization of the Working Capital and Other
Amount, the Closing Adjustment, or  the amount of Intercorporate Debt,
Canadian Equivalent of the CSFB Debt or  Indebtedness for Borrowed Money, all
of which will be governed exclusively by  Section 2.5 or to Claims under
Section 2.12, 5.5, 7.7, 7.8, 10.3, 11.4 or 11.5  or all of which will be
governed exclusively by those Sections.

# 13.6 No Waiver

        (a)  |   Except as provided herein, no failure on the part of
any Party in making any  complaint or exercising any right or remedy under
this Agreement (regardless how  long such failure continues, but subject to
the limitations herein related to  the time within which Claims may be
brought) operates as a waiver thereof, nor  will any single or partial

equity or otherwise conferred.   
---|--- 
    
        (b)  |   Except as provided herein, no waiver of any provision

        (c)  |   No consent or waiver by a Party, express or implied,

 Except as provided herein, any provision of this Agreement under which an obligation of a Party has accrued but has not been discharged will not be affected by termination of this Agreement, nor will the Party liable to perform be discharged as a result of any such termination, nor will termination prejudice any right of a Party against the other in respect of anything done or omitted hereunder prior to such termination or in respect of any right to damages or other remedies. 

   

# 13.10 Time of the Essence

   

 In this Agreement, time is of the essence.
