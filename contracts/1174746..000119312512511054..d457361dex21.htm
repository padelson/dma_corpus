(a) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of any capital stock of Yankees or Merger Sub, at the Effective Time:

(i) each share of Yankeess common stock, par value $0.01 per share (each, a "
_Yankees Share_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Yankees Share to be canceled pursuant to Section
1.6(a)(ii) and other than any Yankees Shares to be converted into Braves
Shares pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(iii) or any Dissenting Shares) shall
automatically be converted, at the election of the holder thereof in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.1(b), into:

 

(A) for each Yankees Share with respect to which the Standard Election is made
and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (or deemed to have been made
pursuant to Section 2.1(b)), (1) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of common stock of Braves, par value $0.01 (each, a "
_Braves Share_"), equal to 0.1703 (the " _Braves Exchange Ratio_ ") and (2)
an amount of cash equal to $11.27, without interest (the " _Standard Cash
Amount_ ");

 

(B) for each Yankees Share with respect to which a Cash Election has been made
and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1(b), either (1) if the
Unprorated Aggregate Cash Consideration is equal to or less than
$2,734,187,877 (the " _Aggregate Cash Consideration_ "), an amount of cash
equal to the Default Cash Election Amount, or (2) if the Unprorated Aggregate
Cash Consideration is greater than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, (x) an
amount of cash equal to the sum of the

 



-3-   Standard Cash Amount and the Cash Oversubscription Amount and (y) a number
of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Braves Shares equal to the
difference between (I) the Braves Exchange Ratio and (II) the quotient
obtained by dividing the Cash Oversubscription Amount by the Braves Share
Price;

(C) for each Yankees Share with respect to which a Stock Election has been
made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.1(b), either (1) if the
Unprorated Aggregate Cash Consideration is equal to or greater than the
Aggregate Cash Consideration, a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable Braves Shares equal to the Default Stock Election Amount, or (2) if
the Unprorated Aggregate Cash Consideration is less than the Aggregate Cash
Consideration, (x) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
Braves Shares equal to the sum of (I) the Braves Exchange Ratio and (II) the
Stock Oversubscription Amount; and (y) an amount of cash equal to the
difference between (aa) the Standard Cash Amount and (bb) the product of the
Stock Oversubscription Amount and the Braves Share Price;

(ii) each Yankees Share held in the treasury of Yankees and each Yankees Share
owned directly by Yankees, Braves or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time (in each case other than Yankees Shares held on behalf of
third parties) shall be canceled and extinguished, and no payment or other
consideration shall be paid with respect to such Yankees Shares;

(iii) each Yankees Share held by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Yankees or Braves (other than Merger Sub) shall be converted
into the right to receive the Default Stock Election Amount; and

(iv) each interest of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Yankees Shares or Braves Shares shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then the Merger Consideration will be appropriately and proportionately
adjusted to provide to the holder of such Yankees Share the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, no Yankees Shares shall remain
outstanding and all Yankees Shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist. Each entry in the records of Yankees or its transfer agent formerly
representing Yankees Shares (the " _Book-Entry Interests_ ") to be converted
in accordance with Section 1.6(a)(i) shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and any distribution or dividend
pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and each Book-Entry Interest that are Dissenting
Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the payment of
which reference is made in Section 1.8. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Company of Yankees Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Book-Entry Interests formerly representing Yankees Shares are presented to the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

 



-4-  (c) _Maximum Aggregate Consideration_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
aggregate amount of cash paid (not including any cash paid pursuant Section
2.1(e)(ii)), and the aggregate number of Braves Shares issued, to all of the
holders of Yankees Shares pursuant to Section 1.6(a) (other than the Braves
Shares issued pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(iii)) shall not exceed the aggregate
amount of cash that would have been paid, and the aggregate number of Braves
Shares that would have been issued, to all of the holders of Yankees Shares
(other than holders of Yankee Shares whose Yankees Shares are converted into
the right to receive the Default Stock Election Amount pursuant to Section
1.6(a)(iii)) had the Standard Election been made with respect to each Yankees
Share.

Section 1.7 Effect of the Merger on Yankees Stock Options and Awards.

(a) Each option to purchase and stock appreciation right denominated in
Yankees Shares (a " _Yankees Stock Option_ ") granted under the employee and
director stock plans of Yankees (the " _Yankees Stock Plans_ "),
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire Yankees Shares and
shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a stock option to acquire or
stock appreciation right denominated in Braves Shares, as applicable (a "
_Braves Stock Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Yankees Stock Option. The number of Braves Shares subject to each
such Braves Stock Option (rounded down to the nearest whole share) shall be
equal to the number of Yankees Shares subject to each such Yankees Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity
Exchange Factor (as defined below), and such Braves Stock Option shall have
an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest penny) equal to the
per-share exercise price applicable to such Yankees Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by the Equity Exchange Factor. 

(b) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of this Section 1.7(b),
each restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit measured in Yankees Shares
(other than performance stock units) (each, a " _Yankees Stock-Based Award_
"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to represent a restricted stock unit or deferred
stock unit] with respect to Yankees Shares and shall be converted, at the
Effective Time, into a restricted stock unit or deferred stock unit
denominated in Braves Shares (a " _Braves Stock-Based Award_ "), on
substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
Yankees Stock-Based Awards. The number of Braves Shares subject to each such
Braves Stock-Based Award (rounded down to the nearest whole share) shall
be equal to the number of Yankees Shares subject to the Yankees Stock-Based
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity
Exchange Factor (defined below) (for the avoidance of doubt, the preceding
provisions shall apply to any restricted stock units or deferred stock units
that are outstanding on the day prior to the Closing Date). All restricted
stock units (other than performance stock units) granted under Yankeess
Omnibus Incentive Plan or under 

 



-6-   Yankeess 2006 Stock Incentive Plan either (i) prior to the date hereof or
(ii) on or after the date hereof pursuant to Yankeess annual bonus program,
to the extent permitted by Section 4.1(a)(iv) of the Yankees Disclosure
Letter, that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (A)
to the extent unvested, vest as of the Effective Time, and (B) be distributed
as of the Effective Time;  _provided_ that, with respect to any such units
that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of
the Code, such distribution shall occur on the date that it would occur under
the applicable award agreement absent the application of this Section 1.7(b).
All other restricted stock units granted after the date hereof to the extent
permitted by Section 4.1(a)(iv) of the Yankees Disclosure Letter that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be subject
to a three-year cliff vesting schedule and the vesting of such restricted
stock units shall not accelerate upon the Effective Time; _provided_ that,
such restricted stock units shall vest upon an earlier termination of
employment with Yankees and its Subsidiaries without "cause" or a resignation
from Yankees and its Subsidiaries for "good reason" (as such terms are defined
in Section 4.1(a)(iv) of the Yankees Disclosure Letter). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Equity Exchange Factor_ " means the sum of (i) the
Braves Exchange Ratio and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the
Standard Cash Amount by (2) the 10-day aggregate volume-weighted average per
share price, rounded to two decimal points of Braves Shares as reported on the
New York Stock Exchange composite transactions reporting system for the 10
consecutive trading days ending on the second-to-last full trading day prior
to the Closing Date.

(c) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of this Section
1.7(c), each performance stock unit measured in Yankees Shares granted under
Yankeess Omnibus Incentive Plan (each, a " _Yankees Performance Stock Award_
"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to represent a performance stock unit with
respect to Yankees Shares and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into
a performance stock unit denominated in Braves Shares (a " _Braves Performance
Stock Award_ "), on substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Yankees Performance Stock Awards. At the Effective Time,
the performance condition in respect of each outstanding Yankees Performance
Stock Award granted prior to the date hereof shall be deemed satisfied
assuming that the Measurement Date (as defined in the applicable performance
stock unit agreement) is the Closing Date, and based on an End Price (as
defined in the applicable performance stock unit agreement) equal to the sum
of (i) the Standard Cash Amount and (ii) the product of (x) the Braves
Exchange Ratio and (y) the per share closing price of the Braves Shares,
rounded to two decimal points, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
composite transactions reporting system on the Business Day immediately prior
to the date hereof; _provided_ that the service condition in respect of each
such outstanding Yankees Performance Stock Award shall remain unchanged and
shall not be deemed satisfied as of the Effective Time, and the original
Measurement Date in respect of the service condition shall continue to apply
to each holder thereof for purposes of continued service-based vesting. At
the Effective Time, the performance condition in respect of each outstanding
Yankees Performance Stock Award granted on or after the date hereof to the
extent permitted by Section 4.1(a)(iv) of the Yankees Disclosure Letter shall
be deemed satisfied at the greater of 100% or the level based on actual
attainment of the applicable performance criteria as of the month ending prior
to the month in which the Effective Time occurs; _provided_ that the service
condition in respect of each such outstanding Yankees Performance Stock Award
shall remain unchanged and shall not be deemed satisfied as of the Effective
Time, and the original Measurement Date in respect of the

 



-7-   service condition shall continue to apply to each holder thereof for
purposes of continued service-based vesting. The number of Braves Shares
subject to each such Braves Performance Stock Award (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) shall be equal to the number of Yankees Shares subject to
the Yankees Performance Stock Award based on the previous sentence multiplied
by the Equity Exchange Factor.

 

(d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Braves shall deliver to
the holders of Yankees Stock Options, Yankees Stock-Based Awards and Yankees
Performance Stock Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to the respective Yankees Stock Plans and agreements
evidencing the grants of such Yankees Stock Options, Yankees Stock-Based
Awards and Yankees Performance Stock Awards, and stating that such Yankees
Stock Options, Yankees Stock-Based Awards and Yankees Performance Stock Awards
and agreements have been assumed by Braves and shall continue in effect on
substantially the same terms and conditions (but subject to the adjustments
required by this Section 1.7 after giving effect to the Merger and the terms
of the Yankees Stock Plans).

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Yankees shall take all necessary action for
the adjustment of Yankees Stock Options, Yankees Stock-Based Awards and
Yankees Performance Stock Awards under this Section 1.7. Braves shall reserve
for issuance a number of Braves Shares at least equal to the number of Braves
Shares that will be subject to Braves Stock Options, Braves Stock-Based Awards
and Braves Performance Stock Awards as a result of the actions contemplated
by this Section 1.7.

(f) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Braves shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is
not available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the Braves Shares
subject to such Braves Stock Options, Braves Stock-Based Awards and Braves
Performance Stock Awards and shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Braves Stock Options, Braves Stock-Based Awards and Braves Performance
Stock Awards remain outstanding.

Section 1.8 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the
extent available under the DGCL, Yankees Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders of
Yankees Shares who shall have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such Yankees Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such Yankees
stockholders shall be entitled instead to receive payment of the fair value

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

 

Section 2.1 _Exchange of Book-Entry Interests_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Braves shall appoint
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust company that is
reasonably satisfactory to Yankees to act as paying and exchange agent
hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, Braves
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Yankees Shares, an aggregate number
of Braves Shares and an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to deliver the
aggregate amount of cash and Braves Shares required pursuant to Section
1.6(a)(i). In addition, Braves shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, as
necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e). All Braves Shares, cash,
dividends and distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to
this Section 2.1 shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

(b) _Election Procedures_. Each holder of a Yankees Share shall have the
right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 2.1(b), to submit
an election (each, an " _Election_ ") in accordance with the following
procedures:

(i) Each holder of a Yankees Share may specify in a request made in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(b) whether such holder
elects to receive with respect to each of his or her Yankees Share either (A)
the consideration set forth in Section 1.6(a)(i)(A) (such Election with
respect to such number of Yankees Shares, the " _Standard Election_ "), (B)
the consideration set forth in Section 1.6(a)(i)(B) (such Election with
respect to such number of Yankees Shares, the " _Cash Election_ "), or (C)
the consideration set forth in Section 1.6(a)(i)(C) (such Election with
respect to such number of Yankees Shares, the " _Stock Election_ ").

 

(ii) Any holder of a Yankees Share who does not properly make an Election in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(b), or whose Election is
not received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline in the
manner provided in Section 2.1(b)(iv), will be deemed to have made the
Standard Election.

 



-9-  (iii) Braves shall cause the appropriate form of election and transmittal
materials (provided that Yankees shall have provided its consent to such
form, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the "
_Transmittal Letter_ ") to be provided by the Exchange Agent to holders of
record of Yankees Shares (other than holders of Yankees Shares subject to
Section 1.6(a)(ii) and Section 1.6(a)(iii)) advising such holders of the
procedure for exercising their right to make the Election and for providing
instructions to the Exchange Agent to effect the transfer and cancellation of
Book-Entry Interests in exchange for the consideration payable pursuant to
Section 1.6(a)(i).

(iv) Any Election set forth in Section 2.1(b)(i) shall have been made properly
only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a
Transmittal Letter properly completed and signed indicating such Election.

(v) Any holder of a Yankees Share may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, change his or her Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly
completed and signed revised Transmittal Letter. If Braves shall determine in
its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect
to any Yankees Share ( _it being understood_ that no Party nor the Exchange
Agent is under any duty to notify any holder of any such defect), such
Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, subject to Section 2.1(b)(ii).

(vi) Any holder of a Yankees Share may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. All Elections shall be revoked
automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Braves that this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VI and will not be
subject to Section 2.1(b)(ii).

(vii) Braves, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the
right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement, governing (A) the validity of the Transmittal Letter and compliance
by any holder of a Yankees Share with the Election procedures set forth
herein, and (B) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into
account in making the determinations prescribed in Section 1.6(a)(i).

(c) _Merger Consideration_. After the Effective Time, and upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of instructions authorizing transfer and cancellation of Book-
Entry Interests in accordance with Section 2.1(b), the terms of the
Transmittal Letter and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Book-Entry Interests shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor, and the Exchange Agent shall be required to
deliver to each such holder, (i) the number of Braves Shares and an amount in
cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(i)
(after taking into account all Yankees Shares then held by such holder and
the Elections(s) made with respect to such Yankees Shares by such holder), and
(ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1(e). The Book-Entry Interests that are the
subject of such authorization shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon such transfer and cancellation
of any Book-Entry Interests. The stock portion of the Merger Consideration
issued and paid and the cash portion of the Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of Section 1.6(a)(i) and this Section 2.1(c) upon
conversion of any

 



-10-   Yankees Shares (including any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.1(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Yankees Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of any Yankees Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of Yankees, the proper number of Braves Shares and the
proper amount in cash may be transferred by the Exchange Agent to such a
transferee if written instructions authorizing the transfer of the Book-Entry
Interests are presented to the Exchange Agent, in any case, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. If any portion of the
Merger Consideration is to be delivered to a Person other than the holder in
whose name any Book-Entry Interests are registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the Person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer
or other similar Taxes required by reason of the transfer of Yankees Shares or
the payment of the applicable cash portion of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of any Book-Entry Interests, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of Braves or the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. The Braves Shares constituting the stock
portion of the Merger Consideration, at Bravess option, shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is otherwise
required under applicable Law. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Person_ " means any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity
of any kind or nature.

 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All Braves Shares to
be paid as a portion of the Merger Consideration shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Braves in respect of the Braves Shares, the record
date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all Braves
Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of the Braves Shares shall be paid to any holder of
any Book-Entry Interests until the instructions for transfer and cancellation
provided in this Article II and in accordance with the terms of the
Transmittal Letter, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.1(a), have been delivered to the
Exchange Agent. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following delivery
to the Exchange Agent of such instructions with respect to Book-Entry
Interests, there shall be issued to the holder of Braves Shares issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or
delivery of such instructions, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
Braves Shares and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Braves Shares
with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent
to surrender.

 

(e) _Fractional Shares_.

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional
Braves Shares shall be issued in the Merger to any holder of Yankees Shares,
no dividends or other distributions of Braves shall relate to such fractional
share interests and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Braves with respect
thereto.

 



-11-  (ii) In lieu of such fractional share interests, Braves shall pay to each
holder of Yankees Shares an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the fractional share interest of any Braves Share to which
such holder (after taking into account all Yankees Shares surrendered by such
holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the per share closing price of the
Braves Shares on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the " _New York Stock
Exchange_ ") on the Closing Date.

 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Person who was a holder of Yankees Shares, Yankees
Options, Yankees Stock-Based Awards or Yankees Performance Stock Awards
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by or on behalf of the Surviving Company
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the relevant
Governmental Entity, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Yankees Shares, Yankees Stock Options, Yankees Stock-Based Awards or Yankees
Performance Stock Awards, as the case may be, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of Yankees 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Braves. Any former Yankees stockholders
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Braves for delivery of any Braves Shares and any cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, and to Braves for payment of any dividends and other
distributions in respect of the Braves Shares of such stockholders payable
and/or issuable pursuant to this Article II without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Yankees, Braves, Merger Sub, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Yankees Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

Section 2.2 _Restructuring of the Merger_. The Parties agree and acknowledge
that, with the prior written consent of Yankees, Braves and Merger Sub may
restructure the Merger; _provided_ that such restructuring shall not (i)
reduce or change the form of the Merger Consideration, or (ii) delay or
prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any material respect.

Adverse Effect has occurred: (i) any change or development in economic,
business, political, regulatory or securities or derivatives markets

acts of war or terrorism) to the extent that such change or development does
not affect the Yankees Group or the Braves Group, respectively, in a
materially disproportionate manner relative to other securities or
derivatives exchanges or trading markets; (ii) any change or development to
the extent resulting from the execution or announcement of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby; or (iii) any change or development to

best interests of, Yankees and its stockholders, approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

by this Agreement.

(e) _No Conflicts_. (i) Neither the execution and delivery by Yankees of this
Agreement, the compliance by it with all of the provisions of and the
performance by it of its obligations under this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions herein contemplated will

(ii) The consolidated balance sheet (including the related notes and
schedules) included in the audited consolidated financial statements of
Yankees for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 (the " _Yankees Financial
Statements_ ") fairly presents the consolidated financial position of Yankees
and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and the consolidated statements of

and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) of Yankees, as required by Rules 13a-15(a)
and 15d-15(a) of the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that all information
required to be disclosed by Yankees in the reports it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Yankees by others within Yankees to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure as required under the Exchange Act and
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified by the SECs rules and forms. Yankees has evaluated the
effectiveness of its respective disclosure controls and procedures and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Yankees Report
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Based on its most recently completed evaluation of its system of
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement,
(A) to the knowledge of Yankees, Yankees had no significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
ability of Yankees to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) Yankees has no knowledge of any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Yankeess internal control over financial reporting.

 

(v) No attorney representing Yankees or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by Yankees or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported to the chief
legal counsel or chief executive officer of Yankees evidence of a material

directors, employees or agents pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

(vi) Since January 1, 2009, to the knowledge of Yankees, no employee of
Yankees or any of its Subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to
any law enforcement agency or Governmental Entity regarding the commission or
possible commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of
any applicable legal requirements of the type described in Section 806 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act by Yankees or any of its Subsidiaries.

(vii) To the knowledge of Yankees, none of the Yankees Reports is the subject
of ongoing SEC review (other than confidential treatment requests). To the
extent not available on EDGAR, Yankees has made available to Braves true and
complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC
received since January 1, 2009 through the

 



-17-   date of this Agreement relating to the Yankees Reports and all written
responses of Yankees thereto through the date of this Agreement other than
with respect to requests for confidential treatment. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC staff with respect to any Yankees Report. To the
knowledge of Yankees, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no SEC
inquiries or investigations, other governmental inquiries or investigations or
internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any
accounting practices of Yankees.

 

(h) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2011, (i) Yankees and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not
engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary and
usual course of such businesses and (ii) there has not been any effect, event,
development, change or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had or is reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Yankees Group.

 

(i) _Compliance_.

(i) Neither Yankees nor any of its Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in
default or violation of, (A) any federal, state or local laws or regulations
(whether civil, criminal or administrative), common law, statutory
instruments, treaties, conventions, directives, regulations or rules made
thereunder, ordinance, by-laws, judgments, orders, injunctions, decrees,
resolutions, arbitration awards, agency requirements, writs,
franchises, variances, exemptions, approvals, licenses or permits in any
applicable jurisdiction (including the United States, European Union or

any such Material Contract where such breach or default has had, or could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Yankees Group. Except as has not had and is

or use, transfer, license or enforce any of their respective intellectual
property rights; or

(i) The Braves Reports were filed in a timely manner and in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws and other requirements applicable
thereto. As of their respective dates (or if amended prior to the date hereof,
as of the date of such amendment), the Braves Reports complied in all material
respects with requirements under applicable Law regarding the accuracy and
completeness of the disclosures contained therein.

(ii) The consolidated balance sheet (including the related notes and
schedules) included in the audited consolidated financial statements of Braves
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 (the " _Braves Financial
Statements_ ") fairly presents the consolidated financial position of Braves
and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and the consolidated statements of

 



-27-   income, equity, and cash flows and of changes in financial position included
in the Braves Financial Statements (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly present the results of operations, equity, cash flows and changes in
financial position, as the case may be, of Braves and its Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein, in each case in conformity with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

(iii) Braves is in compliance in all material respects with (A) the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (B) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of the Yankees. Except as permitted
by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3), since the enactment
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither Braves nor any of its Affiliates has made,
arranged, modified (in any material way), or forgiven personal loans to any
executive officer or director of Braves.

(iv) The disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) of Braves, as required by Rules 13a-15(a) and
15d-15(a) of the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that all information
required to be disclosed by Braves in the reports it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Braves by others within Braves to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure as required under the Exchange Act and is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
by the SECs rules and forms. Braves has evaluated the effectiveness of
its respective disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Braves Report that is a report
on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on
its most recently completed evaluation of its system of internal control over
financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, (A) to the knowledge
of Braves, Braves had no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in
the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Braves to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) Braves has
no knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Bravess internal control
over financial reporting.

(v) No attorney representing Braves or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not employed by Braves or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported to the chief
legal counsel or chief executive officer of Braves evidence of a material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Braves or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(vi) Since January 1, 2009, to the knowledge of Braves, no employee of Braves
or any of its Subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to any law
enforcement agency or other Governmental Entity regarding the commission or
possible commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of any
applicable legal requirements of the type described in Section 806 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act by Braves or any of its Subsidiaries. 

 



-28-  (vii) To the knowledge of Braves, none of the Braves Reports (other than
confidential treatment requests) is the subject of ongoing SEC review. To the
extent not available on EDGAR, Braves has made available to Yankees true and
complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC
received since January 1, 2009 through the date of this Agreement relating to
the Braves Reports and all written responses of Braves thereto through the
date of this Agreement other than with respect to requests for confidential
treatment. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC staff with
respect to any Braves Reports other than confidential treatment requests. To
the knowledge of Braves, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no SEC
inquiries or investigations, other governmental inquiries or investigations or
internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case regarding any
accounting practices of Braves.

 

(h) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2011, (i) Braves and its

respective Subsidiaries officers and directors to, and shall instruct and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, cease immediately any discussions or 

 



-37-   negotiations, if any, with any Person (other than Yankees, Braves and Merger
Sub, as the case may be, and their respective Representatives) conducted prior
to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
shall promptly request that any Person with whom such discussions or
negotiations have occurred since February 2, 2012 and is in possession of
confidential information about it or its Subsidiaries that was furnished by
or on behalf of it return or destroy all such information in accordance with
the terms of the confidentiality agreement with such Person.

(c) Within two (2) Business Days after receipt of an Acquisition Proposal or
any request for nonpublic information or inquiry that a Party reasonably
believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, such Party shall provide the
other Party with written notice of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person
making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. Thereafter, the
Party in receipt of such Acquisition Proposal shall provide the other Party,
as promptly as practicable, with oral and written notice setting forth all
such information as is reasonably necessary to keep such Party informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including material amendments or
proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Yankees and
Braves and the Yankees Board and Braves Board shall be permitted, in the case
of Yankees, prior to the receipt by Yankees of the Yankees Requisite Vote or,
in the case of Braves, prior to the receipt by Braves of the Braves Requisite
Vote, (A) after complying with Section 4.2(e), to (I) in the case of Yankees,
determine either to make no recommendation for the Merger, or to withdraw,
modify or qualify its recommendation for the Merger in a manner that is
adverse to either Braves or Merger Sub (a " _Change in Yankees Recommendation_
") and (II) in the case of Braves, determine either to make no recommendation
for the approval of the issuance of the Braves Shares or any amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation of Braves, or to withdraw, modify or qualify its
recommendation for the approval of the issuance of the Braves Shares or
any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of Braves in a manner that
is adverse to Yankees (a " _Change in Braves Recommendation_ "), or (B) engage
in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information or data
to, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal by any such Person, if and only to the extent that, (i) in the case
of clause (A) above, (x) if such Change in Yankees Recommendation or Change in
Braves Recommendation, as applicable, is made in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, then such Acquisition Proposal shall have been an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Yankees Board or
Braves Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (y) if such Change in Yankees Recommendation or Change in Braves
Recommendation, as applicable, is not made in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, then if such Change in Yankees Recommendation or Change in Braves
Recommendation, as applicable, is in response to, or as a result of, an event,
development, occurrence, or change in circumstances or facts, occurring or
arising after the date of this Agreement, which event, development,
occurrence, or circumstances or facts did not exist or were not actually
known, appreciated or understood by the Yankees Board or the Braves Board,
as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement and the Yankees Board or
Braves Board, as applicable, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to make such Change in
Yankees 

 



-38-   Recommendation or Change in Braves Recommendation, as applicable, would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (with respect to
Yankees, such a Change in Yankees Recommendation, a " _Yankees Intervening
Event Change in Recommendation_ ," and with respect to Braves, such a Change
in Braves Recommendation, a " _Braves Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no event, development,
occurrence or change in circumstances or facts that is reasonably foreseeable,
or arising from any action or omission by any member of the Yankees Group or
the Braves Group that is required to be taken or omitted by this Agreement,
including any action taken or omission made with respect to the obtaining of
the necessary consents and approvals required pursuant to Sections 5.1(c) and
5.1(f) may give rise to a Change in Yankees Recommendation or Change in
Braves Recommendation, as applicable; and (ii) in the case of clause (B)
above, (1) the Yankees Board or Braves Board, as applicable, concludes in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (2) prior to
providing any information or data to any Person in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, the Yankees Board or Braves Board, as
applicable, receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement
with confidentiality terms no less restrictive, in the aggregate, than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (3) Yankees or Braves, as
applicable, is not then in material breach of its obligations under this
Section 4.2 related to such Acquisition Proposal. 

(e) Prior to any Change in Yankees Recommendation, Yankees shall provide
Braves with a written notice (the " _Yankees Change in Recommendation Notice_
") of Yankeess intention to make a Change in Yankees Recommendation at least
five (5) Business Days prior to taking such action, and, in the case of any
Change in Yankees Recommendation in connection with an Acquisition Proposal,
Yankees shall negotiate in good faith during such five (5) Business Day period
with respect to any modifications to the terms of the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement that are proposed by Braves, and Yankees shall consider any
such modifications agreed to by Braves in determining whether such Acquisition
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal after such five (5) Business
Day period; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event of any amendment to
the financial or other material terms of such Superior Proposal, Yankees shall
be required to deliver to Braves a new written notice, and the negotiation
period shall be extended by an additional three (3) Business Days from the
date of Bravess receipt of such new written notice. Prior to any Change in
Braves Recommendation, Braves shall provide Yankees with a written notice (the
" _Braves Change in Recommendation Notice_ ") of Bravess intention to make a
Change in Braves Recommendation at least five (5) Business Days prior to
taking such action, and, in the case of any Change in Braves Recommendation in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, Braves shall negotiate in good faith
during such five (5) Business Day period with respect to any modifications to
the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed
by Yankees, and Braves shall consider any such modifications agreed to by
Yankees in determining whether such Acquisition Proposal still constitutes a
Superior Proposal after such five (5) Business Day period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in the event of any amendment to the financial or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal, Braves shall be required to deliver
to Yankees a new written notice, and the negotiation period shall be extended
by an additional three (3) Business Days from the date of Yankeess receipt
of such new written notice.

 



-39-  (f) In the event that a third party who has previously made an Acquisition
Proposal that the Yankees Board or Braves Board, as applicable, has
determined in accordance with this Section 4.2 is a Superior Proposal
subsequently modifies or amends any material term of such Superior Proposal,
then the applicable Party shall notify the other Party in writing of such
modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again be subject to the provisions of
Section 4.2(d) and Section 4.2(e) in all respects (including the obligation to
deliver a new Yankees Change in Recommendation Notice or Braves Change in
Recommendation Notice, as applicable, and negotiate in good faith with Braves,
or Yankees, as applicable; _provided_ that references to "five (5) Business
Days" or "five (5) Business Day period" shall thereafter be references to
"three (3) Business Days" or "three (3) Business Day period").

(g) Except as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or by stockholder
action, Yankees and Braves each agrees that it will, and will cause its senior
officers, directors and representatives and its Subsidiaries and such
Subsidiaries senior officers, directors and representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
existing as of the date of this Agreement with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Yankees and
Braves each agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform
its directors, officers, agents and representatives of the obligations
undertaken in this Section 4.2. Nothing in this Section 4.2 shall (x) permit
Yankees or Braves to terminate this Agreement (except as specifically provided
in Article VI hereof) or (y) affect any other obligation of Yankees or Braves
under this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Unless this Agreement shall have been earlier terminated and except
as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction or by stockholder action, none
of Yankees or Braves shall submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal (other than the Merger).

(h) Nothing in this Section 4.2 shall prohibit the Yankees Board or Braves
Board, as the case may be, from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A if the Yankees Board or the
Braves Board, as the case may be, determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Yankees Board shall not make a Change in Yankees
Recommendation and the Braves Board shall not make a Change in Braves
Recommendation except, in each case, in accordance with Section 4.2(d) and
Section 4.2(e). 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
obtained not in breach of this Section 4.2 for or in respect of, in the case
of Yankees, 100% of the outstanding Yankees Shares or 100% of the assets of
Yankees and its Subsidiaries, or, in the case of Braves, 100% of the Braves
Shares or 100% of assets of Braves and its Subsidiaries, in each case on a
consolidated basis, on terms that the Yankees Board or Braves Board, as
applicable, in good faith concludes (following receipt of the advice of its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among
other things, all legal, financial, regulatory, timing, the likelihood of
completing such Acquisition Proposal compared to the Merger (taking into
account the extent to which the financial terms of such Acquisition Proposal
exceed the financial terms of the Merger) and other aspects of the
Acquisition Proposal or offer and this Agreement, and taking into account any
improved terms that a Party may have offered pursuant to this Section 4.2
deemed 

 



-40-   relevant by the Yankees Board or Braves Board, as applicable (including
conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation and the ability of
the party making such proposal to obtain financing for such Acquisition
Proposal), are more favorable to the stockholders of Yankees or Braves, as
applicable, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking
into account any such improved terms).

 

Section 4.3 _Stockholders Meetings_.

(a) Yankees shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Yankees
Organizational Documents, all action necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Yankees Stockholders
Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if on the
date the Yankees Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, Yankees has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of Yankees Shares to obtain the
Yankees Requisite Vote, Yankees shall have the right to make one or more
postponements or adjournments of the Yankees Stockholders Meeting; 
_provided_ that the Yankees Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned
to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the Yankees
Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled to be held and (ii) Yankees may
postpone or adjourn the Yankees Stockholders Meeting if Yankees has provided
a written notice to Braves pursuant to Section 4.2(e) that it intends to make
a Change in Yankees Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal,
until a date that is five (5) Business Days after the deadline contemplated
by Section 4.2(e) with respect to such notice or subsequent notices if the
Acquisition Proposal is modified during such five (5) Business Day period.
Subject to Section 6.2, Section 4.2(d) and Section 4.2(e), the Yankees Board
shall recommend adoption of this Agreement, shall include the Yankees
recommendation in the Registration Statement and shall take all reasonable
lawful action to solicit such adoption of this Agreement. In the event that
on or subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Yankees
Stockholders Meeting (including any postponement or adjournment thereof) the
Yankees Board determines to make a Change in Yankees Recommendation, which
Change in Yankees Recommendation shall be made only in accordance with Section
4.2(d) and Section 4.2(e), then Braves shall have a right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 6.4(a). Any Change in Yankees
Recommendation shall not limit or modify the obligation of Yankees to present
this Agreement for adoption at the Yankees Stockholders Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective, and, if this Agreement is not otherwise terminated by either
Yankees or Braves in accordance with the terms hereof, this Agreement shall be
submitted to the stockholders of Yankees at the Yankees Stockholders Meeting
for the purpose of voting on adopting this Agreement.

(b) Braves shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
Organizational Documents, all action necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Braves Stockholders
Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective for the purposes of authorizing the issuance of the stock
portion of the Merger Consideration, in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration as set forth in Section 1.6(a)(i) and to issue Braves Shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(a)(iii) and the approval of any amendments to the
Certificate of Incorporation of Braves that Braves is required to propose to
its stockholders pursuant to Section 4.4 (which amendments shall have been
recommended for approval by the Braves Board) for purposes of obtaining the

 



-41-   consents and approvals required pursuant to Section 5.1(f). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) if on the date the Braves Stockholders Meeting is
scheduled, Braves has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares of its common stock to obtain the Braves Requisite Vote, Braves
shall have the right to make one or more postponements or adjournments of such
stockholders meeting; _provided_ that such stockholders meeting is not
postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for
which such stockholders meeting was originally scheduled to be held and (ii)
Braves may postpone or adjourn the Braves Stockholders Meeting if Braves has
provided a written notice to Yankees pursuant to Section 4.2(e) that it
intends to make a Change in Braves Recommendation in connection with a
Superior Proposal, until a date that is five (5) Business Days after
the deadline contemplated by Section 4.2(e) with respect to such notice or
subsequent notices if the Acquisition Proposal is modified during such five
(5) Business Day period. Subject to Section 6.2, Section 4.2(d) and Section
4.2(e), the Braves Board shall recommend the approval of the issuance of the
Braves Shares in connection with the Merger and shall take all reasonable
lawful action to solicit such approval. In the event that on or subsequent to
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Braves Stockholders Meeting
(including any postponement or adjournment thereof) the Braves Board
determines to make a Change in Braves Recommendation, which Change in Braves
Recommendation shall be made only in accordance with Section 4.2(d) and
Section 4.2(e), then Yankees shall have a right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 6.3(a). Any Change in Braves Recommendation shall not
limit or modify the obligation of Braves to present for approval of the
issuance of the Braves Shares at the Braves Stockholders Meeting as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective, and, if this Agreement is not otherwise terminated by either
Yankees or Braves in accordance with the terms hereof, the issuance of the
Braves Shares shall be submitted to the stockholders of Braves at the Braves
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on approving the issuance of
Braves Shares in connection with the Merger. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Parties shall cooperate and use reasonable
best efforts to hold the Braves Stockholders Meeting and the Yankees
Stockholders Meeting on the same day.

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Filings_. Yankees and Braves shall
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective

such assistance as the other Party may reasonably request to promote the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

promptly as practicable after such filing.

(c) _Prior Review of Certain Information_. Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the sharing of information and appropriate confidentiality safeguards, each
Party shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent

by the other Party and subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of
information and contractual requirements, furnish the other Party with all

effect in the Surviving Companys (or any successors) certificate of
formation and limited liability company agreement after the Effective Time,
provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of
officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses which are, in
the aggregate, no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions contained in the current Certificate of Incorporation
and constitution of Yankees and (iii) cause to be maintained for a period of
six years after the Effective Time the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
Yankees ( _provided_ that the Surviving Company (or any of its successors)
may substitute therefor one or more policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less

 



-46-   advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Surviving Company shall not be required to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums (such amount, as applicable to
Yankees, the " _Maximum Insurance Amount_ ") currently paid by Yankees for
such insurance; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Company shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such amount. The Surviving Company may, in lieu of maintaining
the insurance described in clause (iii) of this Section 4.10, purchase a six-
year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
insured than the current directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Yankees; _provided_ that the
amount paid by the Surviving Company shall not exceed six times the applicable
Maximum Insurance Amount. The obligations of the Surviving Company under this
Section 4.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any indemnities to whom this Section 4.10 applies without the
consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the
indemnitees to whom this Section 4.10 applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 4.10).

Section 4.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Yankees and
Braves shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Yankees Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Yankees
Shares) or acquisitions of Braves Shares (including derivative securities with
respect to Braves Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Yankees to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 4.12 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For the one-year period beginning at the Effective Time (the " _Benefit
Continuation Period_ "), Braves shall provide or cause to be provided to each
individual who is employed as of the Effective Time by Yankees and its
Subsidiaries and who remains employed by the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries (such employees collectively, the " _Affected Employees_ ") (i)
base salary in an amount no less than the base salary provided to the Affected
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual bonus
opportunity that is no less favorable than the annual bonus opportunity
provided to the Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(iii) other compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those provided to the Affected Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
during the Benefit Continuation Period, Braves shall (x) provide or cause to
be provided to each Affected Employee (A) who suffers a termination of
employment by the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries, severance
benefits in amounts and on terms and conditions no less favorable in the
aggregate to such Affected Employee than such Affected Employee would have
received under the severance plans, programs, policies and arrangements
applicable to such Affected Employee as of the date hereof and (B) defined
contribution retirement plan benefits that are no less favorable than the
defined contribution retirement plan benefits provided to Affected Employees
on the date hereof, (y) maintain (or caused to be maintained) the same level
of employer matching contributions as in effect on the date of this Agreement
under the Companys 401(k) investment savings plan and (z) maintain the
Companys Retirement Accumulation Plan

 



-47-   employer contribution levels for existing participants. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of this Section 4.12(a) shall not apply with respect
to Affected Employees whose employment is governed by a collective bargaining
or similar agreement.

(b) With respect to any benefit plans in which any Affected Employees first
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which
such Affected Employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), Braves shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (subject to
applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements) to: (i) waive
all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees
and their eligible dependents under any New Plans in which such Affected
Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to
the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would
apply under the analogous Benefit Plan; (ii) provide each Affected Employee
and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a Benefit Plan (to the same
extent that such credit was given under the analogous Benefit Plan prior to
the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any New Plans in which such Affected Employee may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time for the same plan year; and
(iii) recognize all service of the Affected Employees with Yankees and their
respective Affiliates for all purposes in any New Plan in which such employees
may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, to the extent such
service is taken into account under the applicable New Plan (to the extent
recognized under the corresponding Benefit Plan); _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply for purposes of vesting or eligibility for any plans
which are frozen to new participants, benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plans or to the extent it would result in duplication of
benefits.

(c) Subject to Section 4.12(a), no provision of this Section 4.12 shall be
construed as a limitation on the right of Braves and their Subsidiaries to
amend or terminate any specific Benefit Plan that Yankees would otherwise
have under the terms of such Benefit Plan nor shall any provision of this
Section 4.12 be construed to require the continuation of the employment of any
particular Affected Employee. The provisions of this Section 4.12 are solely
for the benefit of the Parties, and no current or former director, officer,
employee or independent contractor nor any other person shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this Section 4.12, and nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment to any Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or
arrangement for any purpose.

(d) Yankees shall consult with Braves in a good faith and in a reasonably
timely manner in advance of any material communications with Affected
Employees regarding the impact of the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement on the Benefit Plans or the New Plans, as the case may be.

Section 4.13 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") is brought, or, to the
knowledge of Yankees or Braves, threatened in writing, against a Party and/or
the members of the Partys board of directors prior to the Effective Time,
such Party against which the litigation has been brought or which has
knowledge of such threat shall promptly notify the other Party of any such
Transaction Litigation and shall 

 



-48-   keep the other Party reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.
Each Party shall give the other Party the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation, but Yankees shall not
settle, compromise, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to settle,
compromise or come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation,
without Bravess prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 4.14 _Election to Braves Board; Governance_. Braves agrees to take
all action necessary in order to cause four (4) individuals who are (a)
directors of Yankees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b)
reasonably acceptable to Braves (which acceptability shall be confirmed
by Braves in writing following the designation of such individuals in writing
by Yankees) and any applicable Governmental Entities to be appointed as
directors of the Braves Board effective immediately following the Effective
Time.

 

Section 4.15 _Affiliates_. Prior to the date of the Yankees Stockholders
Meeting, Braves shall deliver to Yankees a list of names and addresses of
those Persons who are, in the opinion of Braves, as of the time of the Yankees
Stockholders Meeting referred to in Section 4.3(a), "affiliates" of Yankees
within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. Yankees shall
provide to Braves such information and documents as Braves shall reasonably
request for purposes of preparing such list. There shall be added to such list
the names and addresses of any other Person subsequently identified by
either Braves or Yankees as a Person who may be deemed to be such an
affiliate of Yankees; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Person identified
by Braves shall be on the final list of affiliates of Yankees if Braves shall
receive from Yankees, on or before the date of the Yankees Stockholders
Meeting, an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to Braves to the effect
that such Person is not such an affiliate. Braves shall thereafter deliver to
Yankees a list of names of affiliates of Yankees who will be affiliates of
Braves after the Effective Time (" _Ongoing Affiliates_ "). Yankees shall
exercise its best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Braves, prior
to the date of the Yankees Stockholders Meeting, from each Ongoing Affiliate,
a letter dated as of the Closing Date substantially in the form to be mutually
agreed by the Parties (the " _Affiliates Letter_ "). Braves shall not be
required to maintain the effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement or
any other registration statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of
resale of Braves Shares by such Ongoing Affiliates received in the Merger and
Braves may direct the Exchange Agent not to issue certificates representing
Braves Shares received by any such Ongoing Affiliate until Braves has received
from such Person an Affiliates Letter. Braves may issue certificates
representing Braves Shares received by such Ongoing Affiliates bearing a
customary legend regarding applicable Securities Act restrictions and the
provisions of this Section 4.15.

Section 4.16  _Credit Facility_. Yankees shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange a customary payoff letter and instrument of discharge to be
delivered at Closing providing for the payoff and discharge of the Credit
Agreement, dated as of June 15, 2012, between Yankees, the Subsidiary
Borrowers party thereto, the Lenders party hereto, Citibank, N.A. as
Administrative Agent, and the other financial institutions party thereto as
agents, as amended (the " _Credit Agreement_ ") subject to receipt from
Braves of the full amount of funds indicated in such payoff letter and
instrument of discharge as necessary to effectuate the repayment, discharge
and termination of such facility.

Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.2(c), then Braves shall pay
or cause to be paid to Yankees an amount equal to $100,000,000 by wire
transfer of same day funds (which fee shall be payable within two (2) Business

as the case may be, becomes payable or (2) the Regulatory Reverse Termination
Fee, Braves Termination Payment, Braves Intervening Event Termination Payment
or the fee provided for in Section 6.5(c)(v), as the case may be, becomes
payable, and in each such case, such payment is not made within 30 days of the

-56-  (C) Notwithstanding Sections 6.5(d)(i)(A) or (B), if Braves brings an
action to recover damages from Yankees for breach of this Agreement, or
Yankees brings an action to recover damages from Braves for breach of this
Agreement, then the Party not bringing such action, shall be entitled to bring
an action; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the ability of each Party to recover
under any claim for breach of this Agreement shall be limited pursuant to
Section 6.5(d)(iii).

acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 6.5 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if either Party fails to promptly pay or cause to be paid the
amount due pursuant to this Section 6.5, and, in order to obtain such payment,
the other Party commences a suit that results in a judgment against such
Party for the payment set forth in this Section 6.5 or any portion of such
payment, such Party shall pay the other Party its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of the payment at the prime rate of Citibank,

aggregate. Except as expressly provided in Section 6.5(d)(i)(A), Yankees
aggregate liability for breaches of this Agreement and the Yankees Termination
Payment, Yankees Intervening Event Termination Payment or the fee provided
for under Section 6.5(b)(iv) shall not exceed under any circumstances
$750,000,000 in the aggregate.

unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or

Section 7.16 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree,

if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or are otherwise breached and that any non-

compensated by monetary damages alone and that the Parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, subject to Section 6.5, the Parties shall
be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it
whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to seek and obtain (a)
enforcement of any provision of this Agreement (other than Section 4.4 by
