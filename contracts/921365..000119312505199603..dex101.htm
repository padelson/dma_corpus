clear of all deductions or withholdings whatsoever save only as provided in
this Agreement or as may be required by law.  
---|--- 



   20.4 | If any deduction or withholding is required by law from any
payment in respect of a Buyer Obligation or a Seller Obligation, then, except

person to any other person in respect of a Buyer Obligation or a Seller
Obligation, then, except in relation to interest, the amount so payable shall
be grossed up by such amount as will ensure that, after payment of the tax so
charged, there will be left a sum equal to the amount that would otherwise
have been payable had the sum in question not been so charged to tax. 
---|--- 



   20.6 | If any person receiving payment (the "Recipient") in respect of
a Buyer Obligation or a Seller Obligation receives a refund of or relief from
any tax or other monies payable by it or similar benefit by reason of any
deduction or withholding for or on account of tax or by reason of any tax

additional payments paid to it pursuant to clause 20.4 or clause 20.5 by such
other persons as the Recipient, acting reasonably, certifies to the other
persons will leave it (after such reimbursement) in no better or worse
position than it would have been in if no deduction or withholding had been
required or no tax charge had arisen or (where applicable) if the matter
giving rise to the payment had not arisen. 
---|--- 



 

44 Obligation or Seller Obligation, account shall be taken of any relief or other
benefit available to the Recipient or any of its holding companies or

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Merix Caymans Trading Company Limited, a company
incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands with its registered office
at Century Yark, Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681 GT, Grand
Cayman, British West Indies (the "Company"), unconditionally and irrevocably
promises to pay to the order of Eastern Pacific Circuits Holdings Limited
("Seller") the aggregate of (a) Eleven Million U.S. Dollars (U.S.$11,000,000)
and (b) an amount equal to the EBITDA Earnout Consideration (as defined in the
SPA, as defined below) ("Principal"), plus interest on the unpaid balance of
the Principal from the date hereof at the rate of (i) 7% per annum from the
date of this Note to and inclusive of 1 December, 2006, (ii) thereafter 8% per
annum to and inclusive of 1 December 2007, and (iii) thereafter 9% per annum
until this Note is fully paid as specified below ("Fixed Interest Rate"). The
maturity date of this Note is the later of (a) 15 March 2009; and (b) the date
that is ten (10) Business Days after the date on which all Relevant Claims are
settled ("Maturity Date").



The Company and the Seller are party to a Seller Subordination Agreement
dated on or about the date of this Note with Standard Chartered Bank (Hong
Kong) Limited as the security agent under the Credit Agreement (as defined
below) ("Seller Subordination Agreement"). The terms of this Note are, where
expressly provided for, subject to the terms of the Seller Subordination
Agreement.



     | 1. | _Purchase Agreement_ 
---|---|--- 



This is the Note referred to in the Master Sale and Purchase Agreement dated
14 April, 2005 as varied by letter agreements dated 28 July, 2005 and 16
September 2005 and further amended by a Supplemental Agreement dated 29
September, 2005 ("SPA") between the Seller and Merix Corporation as the Buyer.
Capitalised terms used, but not defined, herein shall have the meaning given
to them in the SPA.



     | 2. | _Subordination to Credit Agreement_ 
---|---|--- 



(a) The Company is a party to a US$30,000,000 credit agreement dated on or
about the date of this Note between (amongst others) the Company and
Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited as the security agent ("Credit
Agreement"). "Senior Obligations" means all of the liabilities and payment
obligations of the Company and its  



 

94  subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement and, subject to paragraph 2(b), all
complete and partial refinancings of such liabilities and payment
obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Note, all payments
hereunder shall be deferred until all the Senior Obligations (actual or
contingent) have been paid and discharged in full unless expressly permitted
under Clause 4 (Permitted Payments) of the Seller Subordination Agreement.



(b) If the Senior Obligations are refinanced on an arms length basis, the
parties agree to enter into a subordination agreement with the parties
advancing funds for the refinancing on terms similar to those in the Seller
Subordination Agreement in respect of and to the extent that the new advances
do not exceed the Senior Obligations then outstanding.



     | 3. | _Payment_ 
---|---|--- 



(a) Accrued interest shall be payable in arrears on the first business day of
each March, June, September and December beginning 1 December 2006 (each a
"Quarterly Payment") and on the Maturity Date; provided that if the prevailing
rate of interest under the Credit Agreement ("Lender Rate") during the
relevant interest period, is less than the Fixed Interest Rate, the interest
payment for such period shall be the amount calculated at the Lender Rate and
the difference between the accrued interest calculated by reference to the
Fixed Interest Rate and the Lender Rate for such period ("Interest
Rate Difference") shall be paid on the Maturity Date. Interest shall accrue
on the Interest Rate Difference at the Fixed Interest Rate and the amount of
such interest shall be paid on the Maturity Date.



(b) Regardless of the date EBITDA Earnout Consideration is determined,
it shall be deemed to have been outstanding from the date of this Note for
all interest calculation purposes. Once the EBITDA Earnout Consideration is
determined, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, subject to the interest
payment limitations in Section 3(a), shall be paid on the first Quarterly
Payment after such determination.



(c) Principal shall be paid in four equal installments of 25% of the Principal
each on 1 March 2007, 1 December 2007, 1 December 2008 and 15 March 2009 (each
a "Principal Payment"). Each Principal Payment shall be made or deemed
satisfied as follows: (i) first, by reduction of the amount due by the amount
of the Post-Cash Working Capital Shortfall determined pursuant to Clause 6.8
of the SPA not previously applied to satisfaction of Principal; (ii) second,
by reduction of the amount due by the amount of settled Relevant Claims not
previously applied to the satisfaction of Principal; (iii) third, by
suspension of the payment obligation by the amount of asserted, but
unsettled, Relevant Claims in the manner provided in Section 4 hereof to the
extent that such unsettled Relevant Claims have not previously been applied to
the suspension of Principal Payments; and (iv) fourth, by payment in
immediately available funds.



(d) If the Company fails to make any Quarterly Payment or Principal Payment or
pay any part thereof on its due date, interest on the unpaid amount shall
accrue on a day to day basis at the relevant Fixed Interest Rate from but
excluding the due date to and including the date of actual payment.



 

95 (e) All payments shall be applied to accrued interest and thereafter to
principal.



(f) All amounts due hereunder are payable in lawful money of the
United States of America.



(g) Principal plus accrued interest may be prepaid at any time without
penalty by the Company.



(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the SPA,
in no event shall any amount payable by the Company as interest or other
charges on this Note exceed the highest lawful rate permissible under any law
applicable hereto. 



     | 4. | _Relevant Claims_ 
---|---|--- 



If, in accordance with Schedule 4 of the SPA, the Buyer gives the Seller
notice of a Relevant Claim, and such Relevant Claim is not settled or
otherwise determined by the date of a Principal Payment, the Principal
Payment shall be suspended in the manner described in Section 3(c) by an
amount equal to such unsettled Relevant Claim ("Amount Claimed"). Upon the
settlement or determination of such Relevant Claim, the Principal Payment
shall be deemed satisfied to the extent of the amount settled or otherwise
determined in respect of such Relevant Claim (the "Settled Amount"), and an
amount equal to the Amount Claimed less the Settled Amount, if any, shall be
paid to the Seller within ten (10) Business Days of the settlement or
determination of such Relevant Claim.



     | 5. | _Acceleration_ 
---|---|--- 



(a) The amounts payable hereunder may be declared immediately due and payable
by the Seller if: (a) the Company fails to make any Quarterly Payment when
due and such failure to pay continues for five (5) days, (b) the Company fails
to make any Principal Payment when due, or (c) the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or the Companys shareholder raises financing other than the
Facility (as defined in the Credit Agreement), which in a single transaction
or a series of related transactions delivers proceeds in excess of
US$50,000,000, or (d) the Company shall have made an assignment for the
benefit of creditors or shall have admitted in writing its inability to pay
its debts as they become due or consented to the appointment of a receiver or
liquidator or trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of all or of
substantially all of its property; or by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction a receiver or liquidator or trustee of the Company or any of its
property shall have been appointed and shall not have been discharged within
60 days, or by decree of such a court the Company shall have been adjudicated
insolvent and such decree shall have continued undischarged and unstayed for
60 days after the entry thereof; or a petition to reorganize the Company,
pursuant to any bankruptcy or similar statute applicable to the Company,
shall have been filed against the Company and shall not have been dismissed
 



 

96  within 60 days after such filing, or the Company shall have been adjudicated
a bankrupt, or shall have filed a petition in voluntary bankruptcy under
any provision of any bankruptcy law, or shall have consented to the filing of
any bankruptcy or reorganization petition against it under any such law, or
shall have filed a petition to reorganize the Company pursuant to any
applicable law, provided that the foregoing acceleration right may not be
exercised in a manner that causes the outstanding Principal at any time to be
less than the prevailing liability cap, as determined in accordance with Part
1 of Schedule 9 of the SPA (the "Retained Amount"). Thereafter, on each date
on which the liability cap falls in accordance with Part 1 of Schedule 9 of
the SPA, and if Seller has exercised the foregoing acceleration right, the
Company shall forthwith pay to the Seller the difference between the Retained
Amount and the prevailing liability cap.



(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Note, the Sellers rights
under paragraph (a) above may only be exercised in accordance with the Seller
Subordination Agreement.



     | 6. | _Amendments to the Credit Agreement_ 
---|---|---

consent of the Seller agree to any amendment of any term of the
Credit Agreement, except for an amendment which:



     | (i) | is procedural or administrative in nature; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | does not result in the Company being subjected to more
onerous obligations than those existing at the date hereof or which would
otherwise prejudice the Sellers rights under this Note. 
---|---|--- 



(b) If:



     | (i) | an Event of Default has been declared (other than in respect
of a matter referred to in Clause 20.3(b) (Breach of other obligations) under
the Credit Agreement) and is outstanding under the Credit Agreement; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | an Event of Default has been declared in respect of a
matter referred to in Clause 20.3(b) (Breach of other obligations) under the
Credit Agreement and the Facility Agent has taken action to accelerate the
Senior Obligations in respect of such an Event of Default, 
---|---|--- 



     |  | the Company may agree to any amendment of any term of the
Credit Agreement without the consent of the Seller. 
---|---|--- 


 

97 ---|---|--- 



All sums payable under this Note shall be paid in full without set-off or
counterclaiming for any reason and without deduction of or withholding for
any taxes, duties levies, imposts or charges of any nature other than as
contemplated in paragraphs 3(c), 4 and 5 hereof.



     | 8. | _Waiver_ 
---|---|--- 



The Company hereby waives demand, protest and notice of demand, protest and
nonpayment and consent to any and all renewals and extensions of the time
of payment under this Note.

   | 
  "claim" |  | includes (without limitation) any assessment, claim,
notice, demand, letter, direction, counterclaim or other document issued or
action taken by or on behalf of any fiscal, revenue or other authority or

distribute, acquisition, disposal, transfer, payment, loan or advance and
reference to any event on or before the Completion Date; and 
   | 
  "Relief from Taxation" |  | any loss, relief, allowance, set-off,

any legislation or otherwise in respect of Tax. 
 



 

109 received shall include income, profits or gains deemed to have been or treated
as or regarded as earned, accrued or received. 
---|--- 



   2. | _INDEMNITY_ 
---|--- 



   2.1 | In consideration of the Sale and Purchase Agreement and of the
Covenantee completing the same the Covenantor hereby covenants with and
undertakes to the Covenantee and each of the Companies to indemnify and keep
indemnified the Covenantee and (as a separate covenant) each of the Companies
on a continuing basis for: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | the amount of any claim for Tax which has been made or may
hereafter be made against the Covenantee or any of the Companies or the
relevant Buyers Group Company which has acquired the HK Shares or the
Singapore Shares (as the case may be) wholly or partly in respect of or in
consequence of any event occurring or any income, profits or gains earned,
accrued or received by any of the Companies on or before Completion;  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | any claim for Tax made against the Covenantee or any of the
Companies or the relevant Buyers Group Company which has acquired the HK
Shares or the Singapore Shares (as the case may be) arising on the death of
any person under section 35 of the Estate Duty Ordinance (Cap.lll) or any
relevant PRC or Singapore tax legislation at any time by reason of any
transfer of any property to the Covenantee or any of the Companies made or
deemed to have been made on or before Completion; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Covenantee
or any of the Companies or the relevant Buyers Group Company which has
acquired the HK Shares or the Singapore Shares (as the case may be) in
connection with any such claim for Tax or in taking or defending any action
under this Deed. 
---|---|--- 



   3. | _EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS_ 
---|--- 



   3.1 | The Sellers liability pursuant to the indemnity given by clause
2 shall be limited or excluded, as the case may be, as set out in schedule 4
of the Sale and Purchase Agreement and the indemnity given in clause 2 does
not cover any amount of Tax: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | to the extent that provision or reserve in respect thereof
was made in the Financial Statements or to the extent that payment or
discharge of such liability has been duly reflected in the Financial
Statements; 
---|---|--- 



 

110 increased as a result of any increase in rates of Tax or changes made in the
relevant Tax Law in the PRC, Hong Kong and Singapore made after Completion
with retrospective effect; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | to the extent that the liability for Tax would not have
arisen but for an act, a failure or omission on the part of the Covenantee or
any other Buyers Group Company before, on and after Completion or an act, a
failure or omission on the part of the Companies after Completion. For the
avoidance of doubt, any action taken by the Covenantee or any other Buyers
Group Company in compliance with its respective obligations under the Sale
and Purchase Agreement and this Deed including without limitation any consent
given by the Covenantee or any other Buyers Group Company under the Sale and
Purchase Agreement and this Deed shall not constitute an act that has caused
any liability for Tax to arise under this sub-clause 3(c); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | to the extent that the liability for Tax (including interest
and penalties) arises which should have been borne by the Buyer pursuant to
clause 20.1 of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   4. | _OBLIGATIONS OF THE COVENANTEE_ 
---|--- 



If the Covenantee shall becomes aware of any claim for Tax which it appears to
the Covenantee that the Covenantor is or may become liable to make
any payment under this Deed, it shall as soon as practicable give written
notice to the Covenantor and shall take such action as the Covenantor may
reasonably request to dispute, resist or compromise the liability. Neither the
Covenantor nor the Covenantee shall in any event be required to take any
steps which would require any admission of guilt or liability relating to
matters connected with the claim in question.



   5. | _AUDITORS  CERTIFICATES_ 
---|--- 



If any of the Companies shall procure a certificate from the Auditors
certifying the amount of any such claim for Tax as is mentioned in clause 2
and stating that in the opinion of the Auditors none of the exceptions from
liability listed in clause 3 are of application to the claim in question then
such certificate shall be final and binding upon the Covenantor and upon
receipt of such certificate the Covenantor shall forthwith pay to any of the
Companies the amount so certified but the Companies shall reimburse or credit
the Covenantor with any sum (less the expenses of recovering the same) which
is subsequently recovered from a third party or repaid to any of the
Companies in connection with such liability.



 

111 ---|--- 



The liabilities of the Covenantor under this indemnity shall be payable in
full within ten (10) business days of written demand from any of
the Companies or on the date which such payment is due to be made to the
relevant authority, whichever is the later.



   7. | _WAIVER_ 
---|--- 



No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising on the part of any of the
Covenantee or any of the Companies any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights and remedies provided in this Deed are cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies otherwise provided by law.
