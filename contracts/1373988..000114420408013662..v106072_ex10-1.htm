based on or measured  by  income, receipts or profits earned during a
Straddle Period, be deemed equal  to  the amount that would be payable if
the Straddle Period ended on and included  the Closing Date. To the extent
that any Tax for a Straddle Period is based  on  the greater of a Tax on net
income, on the one hand, and a Tax measured by  net  worth or some other
basis not otherwise measured by income, on the other hand,  the portion of
such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will be  deemed to be (i)
if the amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period is measured  by net worth
or such other basis, the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle  Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days  in 
the Pre-Closing Straddle Period, and the denominator of which is the number 
of  days in the Straddle Period or (ii) if the amount of such Tax for the
Straddle  Period is measured by net income, the amount of such Tax determined
as though  the Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date.

shall notify  Purchaser whether or not the Wachovia Swap Agreements will be
terminated by  the  Company on or prior to the Closing Date. In the event
the Wachovia Swap  Agreements are terminated prior to Closing for any reason,
all unpaid  obligations of the Company to Wachovia under the Wachovia Swap
Agreements  associated with such termination will be included in the
definition of Funded  Indebtedness under this Agreement. In the event the
Wachovia Swap Agreements  remain in effect on and after the Closing Date and
for as long as such Wachovia  Swap Agreements remain in effect, the Seller
Representative shall pay to  Purchaser, within 10 days after the end of each
calendar quarter following  the  Closing Date, an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of the obligations of  the  Company to Wachovia under the
Wachovia Swap Agreements settled in cash for  such  calendar quarter, and,
to secure Seller Representative's obligations under this  Section 2.2(e), the
Seller Representative shall, at the Closing, deposit a  portion of the Total
Purchase Price into an escrow account equal to the  estimated liability of
the Company to Wachovia associated with the termination  of the Wachovia Swap
Agreements assuming such termination occurred at the  Closing as determined
by the Purchaser and the Seller Representative after  consultation with
Wachovia Bank. Such escrow account shall be held by a bank  or  other
financial institution mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller 
Representative and shall be held for such period and on such terms as
Purchaser  and Seller Representative may agree (it being understood that (i)
the term  of  such escrow shall not extend beyond the termination of the
Wachovia Swap  Agreements, (ii) Seller Representative shall be permitted to
use a portion  of  the escrow funds to purchase one or more hedging
instruments to limit downside  risk associated with the Wachovia Swap
Agreements and (iii) Seller  Representative shall be entitled to quarterly
payments from such escrow equal  to  all interest income earned by such
escrow during each quarter). In the event  the  Company receives payment
from Wachovia on account of the Wachovia Swap  Agreements, the Company shall
remit such payment to Seller Representative within  10 days upon receipt
thereof. At the request of Seller Representative, Purchaser  shall terminate
the Wachovia Swap Agreements. Upon such termination by Purchaser  or upon a
termination of the Wachovia Swap Agreements for any other reason  after  the
Closing, Seller Representative shall pay to Purchaser all obligations of 
the  Company to Wachovia under the Wachovia Swap Agreements associated with
such  termination. Purchaser may not affirmatively elect to terminate the
Wachovia  SWAP Agreements without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative,  unless Purchaser agrees to bear all unpaid obligations of
the Company to  Wachovia under the Wachovia Swap Agreements associated with
such  termination.

**Section  2.3 _Working  Capital Adjustment_.**

 

 

(a) On  the  date three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Holdings shall prepare  and deliver to the Purchaser the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet of the Company,  the calculation of the Bonus Amounts, and a
statement calculating the Estimated  Working Capital of the Company,
determined as set forth in **_Exhibit  A_**.  The  ** _" Working  Capital
Target" _**means  $4,500,000. In the event that the Estimated Working Capital
of the Company  exceeds the Working Capital Target, the Total Purchase Price
payable on the  Closing Date will be increased by the amount of such excess
(the **_" Excess  Payment"_**).  In the  event that the Estimated Working
Capital of the Company is less than the Working  Capital Target, the Total
Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date will be  decreased by the amount
of such shortfall (the **_" Shortfall  Reduction"_**).  The  Total Purchase
Price will be subject to further adjustment upon final,  post-Closing
determination of the Working Capital of the Company, as provided  in  **
_Section  2.3(b)_**   below.

 

 

(b) As  soon  as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in
any event within  thirty (30) days thereafter, the Purchaser shall prepare
and deliver to the  Seller Representative the Closing Balance Sheet of the
Company and a statement  calculating the Working Capital of the Company. The
Seller Representative and  its independent certified public accountants may
review the Closing Balance  Sheet of the Company and the calculation
regarding Working Capital of the  Company and may make inquiry of the
representatives of the Purchaser's  accountants, the Purchaser and the
Company, who shall reasonably cooperate  with  the Seller Representative
(including, without limitation, by providing the  Seller Representative
and/or its agents access to financial accounts and  underlying source
documents related to the preparation of the Closing Balance  Sheet and
calculation of Working Capital). The calculation regarding the Working 
Capital of the Company shall be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed
accepted  by, the Members unless the Seller Representative shall have
notified the  Purchaser in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of
the Closing  Balance Sheet of the Company of any objections thereto. The
Seller  Representative may send a written notice to Purchaser at an earlier
date if  it  is in agreement with the Purchaser's final closing Working
Capital amount and  the Working Capital amount shall be deemed finally
determined on receipt of  that  written notice by the Purchaser. At the
request of either the Seller  Representative or the Purchaser, any dispute
between the parties relating to  the  calculation of Working Capital of the
Company that cannot be resolved by them  within thirty (30) days after
receipt of notice of any objections to such  calculation pursuant to this
**_Section  2.3(b)_**   shall be  referred to KPMG International (the **_"
Auditor"_**)  for  decision, which decision shall be final and binding on
both parties. The Auditor  shall address only those items in dispute and may
not assign a value greater  than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or smaller than  the smallest value for such item claimed by
either party. The parties agree  that  they will request that the Auditor
render its decision within thirty (30) days  after referral of the dispute to
the Auditor for decision pursuant hereto.  The  fees and expenses of the
Auditor shall be allocated to the parties as determined  by the Auditor based
upon the relative success (in terms of percentages) of  each  party's
claims. For example, if the Auditor's final decision reflects a 60-40 
compromise of the parties' claims, the Auditor would allocate expenses 40%
to  the party whose claim was determined to be 60% successful and 60% to the
party  whose claim was determined to be 40% successful. The date on which the
Working  Capital of the Company is finally determined in accordance with
this  ** _Section  2.3(b)_**   is  hereinafter referred to as the **_"
Working  Capital Determination Date_**. ** _"_**

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-12-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If  the  Working Capital of the Company as finally determined pursuant
to **_Section  2.3(b)_**   exceeds  the Estimated Working Capital, then the
Total Purchase Price will be increased  by the amount of such excess (the
**_" Excess  Consideration"_**).  If the  Working Capital of the Company as
finally determined pursuant to **_Section  2.3(b)_**   is less  than the
Estimated Working Capital, then the Total Purchase Price will be  decreased
by the amount of such shortfall (the **_" Shortfall  Consideration"_**). 
The  Total Purchase Price adjustment required hereby is referred to as the 
** _" Adjustment_**. ** _"_**

 

 

(d) Promptly,  and in any event no later than the fifth Business Day after
the Working Capital  Determination Date (the **_" Settlement  Date"_**):

 

 

(i) In  the  event of a determination of Excess Consideration pursuant to
**_Section  2.3(c)_** ,  then  (A) the Purchaser will pay to the Seller
Representative, for the benefit of  the  Members, the Excess Consideration,
together with interest thereon at a rate  per  annum equal to the Applicable
Rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number  of days elapsed over 360,
from the Settlement Date to the date of payment,  by  wire transfer of
immediately available funds, and (B) the Purchaser and Seller  Representative
shall execute and deliver a joint written authorization letter  to  the
Escrow Agent authorizing the Escrow Agent to promptly release to the Seller 
Representative, on behalf of the Members, the amount contemplated by Section 
3(f) of the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(ii) In  the  event of a determination of Shortfall Consideration pursuant
to **_Section  2.3(c)_** ,  then  the Purchaser and Seller Representative
shall execute and deliver a joint  written authorization letter to the Escrow
Agent authorizing the Escrow Agent  to  promptly release (A) to Purchaser
from the Escrow Fund the amount of such  Shortfall Consideration, together
with interest thereon at a rate per annum  equal to the Applicable Rate,
calculated on the basis of the actual number  of  days elapsed over 360,
from the Settlement Date to the date of payment, and  thereafter, (B) to the
Seller Representative, on behalf of the Members, the  amount contemplated by
Section 3(f) of the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(e)   Within a  reasonable time prior to the Closing, Seller Representative
shall notify  Purchaser whether or not the Wachovia Swap Agreements will be
terminated by  the  Company on or prior to the Closing Date. In the event
the Wachovia Swap  Agreements are terminated prior to Closing for any reason,
all unpaid  obligations of the Company to Wachovia under the Wachovia Swap
Agreements  associated with such termination will be included in the
definition of Funded  Indebtedness under this Agreement. In the event the
Wachovia Swap Agreements  remain in effect on and after the Closing Date and
for as long as such Wachovia  Swap Agreements remain in effect, the Seller
Representative shall pay to  Purchaser, within 10 days after the end of each
calendar quarter following  the  Closing Date, an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of the obligations of  the  Company to Wachovia under the
Wachovia Swap Agreements for such calendar  quarter, and, to secure Seller
Representative's obligations under this Section  2.2(e), the Seller
Representative shall, at the Closing, deposit a portion  of  the Total
Purchase Price into an escrow account equal to the estimated liability  of
the Company to Wachovia associated with the termination of the Wachovia 
Swap  Agreements assuming such termination occurred at the Closing as
determined  by  the Purchaser and the Seller Representative after
consultation with Wachovia  Bank. Such escrow account shall be held by a bank
or other financial institution  mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller
Representative and shall be held  for  such period and on such terms as
Purchaser and Seller Representative may agree  (it being understood that (i)
the term of such escrow shall not extend beyond  the termination of the
Wachovia Swap Agreements, (ii) Seller Representative  shall be permitted to
use a portion of the escrow funds to purchase one or  more  hedging
instruments to limit downside risk associated with the Wachovia Swap 
Agreements and (iii) Seller Representative shall be entitled to quarterly 
payments from such escrow equal to all interest income earned by such escrow 
during each quarter). In the event the Company receives payment from
Wachovia  on  account of the Wachovia Swap Agreements, the Company shall
remit such payment  to  Seller Representative within 10 days upon receipt
thereof. At the request of  Seller Representative, Purchaser shall terminate
the Wachovia Swap Agreements.  Upon such termination by Purchaser or upon a
termination of the Wachovia Swap  Agreements for any other reason after the
Closing, Seller Representative shall  pay to Purchaser all obligations of the
Company to Wachovia under the Wachovia  Swap Agreements associated with such
termination. Purchaser may not  affirmatively elect to terminate the Wachovia
SWAP Agreements without the prior  written consent of the Seller
Representative, unless Purchaser agrees to bear  all unpaid obligations of
the Company to Wachovia under the Wachovia Swap  Agreements associated with
such termination.

-46-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**Section  11.6 ****_Limitations  on Indemnification_**.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

 

(a) No  Indemnitee shall be entitled to reimbursement and indemnification
pursuant  to  ** _Sections  11.2_**   or  ** _11.3_**   on  account of
any Losses to the extent (i) any such Losses are covered by any  insurance or
other third party proceeds and (ii) such Indemnitee actually  receives such
proceeds; provided that an Indemnitee shall make commercially  reasonable
efforts to seek recovery under any insurance policy. Notwithstanding 
anything herein to the contrary, an Indemnitee may pursue recovery hereunder 
prior to the resolution of any such insurance claim, and the Indemnifying
Party  shall pay to the Indemnitee such amounts as it would otherwise be
obligated  to  pay to such Indemnified Party without regard to this
**_Section  11.6(a)_**   and  prior to such time as such Indemnitee has
determined whether such Losses are  covered (or not covered) by insurance
held by such Indemnitee. In the event  the  Indemnitee receives any amounts
paid by such insurance in connection with Losses  for which such Indemnitee
received reimbursement and indemnification from any  Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnitee shall pay such amounts (up to the amount  of  Losses for which
reimbursement and indemnification was actually made) to such  Indemnifying
Party.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
there shall be no right  to  reimbursement and indemnification to the extent
(and only to the extent) the  expense, loss or liability comprising the Loss
(or a part thereof) with respect  to such matter has been taken into account
in the final determination of the  Working Capital and/or the Working Capital
Adjustment.

 

 

**Section  11.7 ****_Procedures_**.

 

 

(a) _Notice  of Losses by an Indemnitee_.  Subject  to **_Section  12.5_**
  with  respect to Tax Matters, as soon as reasonably practicable after an
Indemnitee  has Knowledge of any claim that it has under this **_Article 
XI_**   that may  result in a Loss (a **_" Claim"_**),  the  Indemnitee
shall give written notice thereof (a **_" Claims  Notice"_**)  to the 
Indemnifying Party. The parties hereby agree that any notice required to be 
provided to the Members shall be sent to the Seller Representative pursuant 
to  ** _Section  13.7_**   hereof.  A Claims Notice must describe the
Claim in reasonable detail, and indicate  the  amount (estimated, as
necessary and to the extent feasible) of the Loss that  has  been or may be
suffered by the Indemnitee; provided if the Indemnifying Party  is  not
satisfied with the detail contained in any Claims Notice it shall request 
in  writing additional detail from the Indemnitee. No delay in or failure to
give  a  Claims Notice by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party pursuant
to this  **_Section  11.7(a)_**   will  adversely affect any of the other
rights or remedies that the Indemnitee has  under this Agreement, or alter or
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its  obligations under this Agreement
except to the extent (and then only to the  extent that) that the failure to
give notice causes the Indemnifying Party  to  suffer Losses for which it is
obligated to be materially greater than such  Losses would have been had the
Indemnitee given the Indemnifying Party prompt  notice hereunder. The
Indemnifying Party shall respond to the Indemnitee (a  **_" Claim 
Response"_**)  within  ten (10) Business Days (the **_" Response 
Period"_**)  after  the date that the Claims Notice is received by the
Indemnifying Party. Any  Claim  Response must specify whether or not the
Indemnifying Party disputes the Claim  described in the Claims Notice. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to give a Claim  Response within the Response
Period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed  not  to dispute the Claim
described in the related Claims Notice. If the Indemnifying  Party elects not
to dispute a Claim described in a Claims Notice, whether by  failing to give
a timely Claim Response or otherwise, then the amount of Losses  alleged in
such Claims Notice will be conclusively deemed to be an obligation  of  the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party delivers a Claim Response 
within the Response Period indicating that it disputes one or more of the 
matters identified in the Claims Notice, the Indemnifying Party and the 
Indemnitee shall promptly meet and use their reasonable efforts to settle
the  dispute. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee are unable to
reach  agreement within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the Response
Period,  then the dispute shall be submitted by either party to arbitration
in accordance  with **_Section  11.9_**.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-47-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Opportunity  to Defend Third Party Claims_.  Except  as set forth in
**_Section  12.5_**   with  respect to Tax Matters, in the event that any
claim by a third party against  an  Indemnitee for which indemnification and
reimbursement, as applicable, is sought  by an Indemnitee, the Indemnifying
Party has the right, exercisable by written  notice to the Indemnitee, within
ten (10) Business Days of receipt of a Claims  Notice from the Indemnitee to
assume and conduct the defense of such claim  with  counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party has  assumed such defense as
provided in this **_Section  11.7(b)_** ,  the  Indemnifying Party will not
be liable for any legal expenses subsequently  incurred by any Indemnitee in
connection with the defense of such Claim. If  the  Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of any third party claim in  accordance with this
**_Section  11.7(b)_**   and to  the extent that such Claim is subject to
indemnification and reimbursement  under  this Agreement, the Indemnitee may
continue to defend such claim at the sole  cost of the Indemnifying Party
(subject to the limitations set forth in this  **_Article  XI_** )  and
the  Indemnifying Party may still participate in, but not control, the
defense of  such third party claim at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and
expense.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of which party controls
the defense  of  a claim, such party shall have an obligation to keep the
other party informed  as  to the progress and status of such claim and to
provide such other party with  such information about the claim as it shall
reasonably request.

 

 

(c) _Settlement_.  Prior  to  agreeing to any settlement of,  or the 
entry of any judgment arising from, any Claim, the party controlling the
defense  of such Claim shall give the other party at least ten (10) days to

other party with  all  information as such other party shall reasonably
request in order to evaluate  the settlement or entry of judgment. The party

The financial report refers to Note #1 of  the financial statement for these
descriptions. Summarized below are the  differences.

When  Holdings acquired the Company, Holdings allocated the purchase price 
between tangible assets and goodwill. The total cost of the acquisition  of 
$169,352,174 was allocated to an opening balance sheet goodwill amount  of 
$68,259,591 and then the remainder of $101,092,583 was allocated  among the 
net tangible assets acquired based on their fair values. This resulted  in 
$94,000,000 being allocated to all of the land, buildings, equipment  and 
rental equipment acquired. The implications are as  follows:

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

(a) Under  GAAP on the date of acquisition there would have been no goodwill
related to  the  acquisition since the appraised fair value of the assets on
the date of  acquisition was over $240 million and in excess of the total
purchase price.  As  a result there would be no amortization of goodwill
under GAAP because there  would have been no goodwill.

 

 

(b) The  property and equipment would have been assigned the entire purchase
price  allocated to goodwill under GAAP.

 

 

(c) The  property and equipment is depreciated on a much accelerated basis
under the  Internal Revenue Service Regulations by using the modified
accelerated cost  recovery system depreciation method. As an example, a new
crawler crane under  this system is 100% depreciated within 6 years which on
a GAAP basis this would  be significantly longer on these assets that last
more than 40 years when  properly maintained.

The  original purchase price had no value allocated to the spare parts 
inventory because there was no perpetual inventory system at the  date of 
acquisition and there were more than 10,000 part numbers located  in 
several yard warehouses. Since the acquisition, new real-time systems  have 
been implemented and a physical inventory has been taken. However,  the 
Company had to continue the policies of its predecessor post acquisition 
because of the lack of systems at that time. Accordingly, the purchase  of 
spare parts inventory continues to be expensed at the time of purchase  and 
is not capitalized in the financial statements. The values and quantities 
are however tracked in the real-time ERP subsystem and general  ledger.

Accounting  for Information Systems Equipment and Software as noted in the
financial  statement footnotes **_"_** certain  costs have been expensed
under the modified tax basis approach that  would  otherwise have been
capitalized under generally accepted accounting  principles in the United
States of America as determined by SOP 98-1,  Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained  for  Internal Use. ** _"_**  
These costs have been amortized on a basis of three years straight  line.
