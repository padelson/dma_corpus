ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ and that the Company shall have complied
with its obligations under _Section 1.2_, as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof (but in no event more than twenty (20) business days
thereafter), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) the
Offer; _provided_ that, without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) use reasonable best efforts to commence the
Offer on or prior to April 9, 2018. In the Offer, each share of Company Common
Stock accepted by Purchaser in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Offer shall be exchanged for the right to receive (i)
$36.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), and (ii)
0.0711 of a share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent ("
_Parent Common Stock_ "), without interest (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and,
together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Offer Consideration_ "), subject
to the other provisions of this  _Article I_. The Offer shall be made by
means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that is
disseminated to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act
and contains the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (including
_Annex C_ ). Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and conditions hereof
(including _Annex C_ ). The obligation of Purchaser to accept for exchange
(and the obligation of Parent to cause Purchaser to accept for exchange)
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn)
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to:

 



-2- (i) the condition that, prior to the expiration of the Offer, there have been
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of
the Offer a number of shares of Company Common Stock that, upon the
consummation of the Offer (for the avoidance of doubt, assuming that shares of
Class B Common Stock validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) will
convert into shares of Class A Common Stock upon the consummation of the
Offer), together with the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent
and Purchaser (if any) (excluding shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received,"
as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for
the Offer pursuant to such procedures), would represent at least a majority
of the aggregate voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately after the consummation of the Offer (the " _Minimum
Condition_ "); and

 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex C_.

 

(b) Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive or modify any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of, or conditions
to, the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth herein, without the prior written consent
of the Company (which may be granted or withheld in its sole
discretion), Purchaser may not (and Parent shall not permit Purchaser to) (i)
amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, or waive any of the conditions
set forth in clauses (B), (C), (D) or (E) of _Annex C_ or (ii) make any change
in the terms of or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of
consideration or changes the cash-stock mix to be paid in the Offer, (B)
decreases the consideration in the Offer or the number of shares of Company
Common Stock sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer, other than in a
manner required or permitted by the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)_, (D)
imposes conditions to the Offer other than those set forth in _Annex C_ , (E)
amends or modifies (for the avoidance of doubts, waivers shall be governed by
clause (i) above) any of the conditions set forth in Annex C or (F) amends or
modifies any other term of or condition to the Offer in any manner that is
adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock.

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to the Offer, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (after aggregating all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock _multiplied
by_ the Parent Trading Price, rounded to the nearest cent.

 

(d) _Adjustments to Offer Consideration_. The Offer Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent
Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance
Time. Nothing in this  _Section 1.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



-3- (e) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, eastern standard time, on the
date that is twenty (20) business days (for this purpose calculated in
accordance with Section 14d-1(g) (3) and Rule 14e-1(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after the date the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer
is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer
shall expire on the date and at the time to which the Offer has been so
extended. 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)(i)_ or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, unless Parent receives the prior
written consent of the Company (which may be granted or withheld in its sole
discretion):

(A) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer
for any period required by any Law, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or its staff or of the NYSE, in any such case, which is
applicable to the Offer, or to the extent necessary to resolve any comments
of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or the Offer Documents or the
Form S-4;

(B) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer (other than the
Minimum Condition, and other than any such conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer) have not been satisfied or
waived as of any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for successive extension
periods of up to ten (10) business days each (or for such longer period as may
be agreed by Parent and the Company) in order to permit the satisfaction or
valid waiver of the conditions to the Offer (other than the Minimum
Condition); _provided_ that if any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer
occurs on or before May 5, 2018, then Parent and Purchaser shall not extend
the Offer beyond 11:59 p.m. New York City time on May 8, 2018 (for clarity,
without limiting Parents and Purchasers rights or obligations to further
extend, if applicable); and

 

(C) if as of any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer each condition to the
Offer (other than the Minimum Condition, and other than any such conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer (if
such conditions would be satisfied or validly waived were the expiration of
the Offer to occur at such time)) has been satisfied or waived and the
Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, Purchaser may, and, at the request
in writing of the Company, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to, extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten (10)
business days each (with the length of each such period being determined in
good faith by Parent) (or for such longer period as may be agreed by Parent
and the Company); _provided_ that in no event shall Purchaser or Parent be
required to extend the expiration of the Offer for more than twenty (20)
business days in the aggregate; _provided_ , _further_ , that if any then-
scheduled expiration of the Offer occurs on or before May 5, 2018, then Parent
and Purchaser shall not extend the Offer beyond 11:59 p.m. New York City time
on May 8, 2018 (for clarity, without limiting Parents and Purchasers rights
or obligations to further extend, if applicable);

 



-4- _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, (x) any such extension shall not be deemed to impair, limit,
or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Parties to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_; and (y) if the Offer would
otherwise expire pursuant to this _Section 1.1(e)_ at any time after 11:59
p.m. New York City Time on May 8, 2018 and on or prior to May 24, 2018, Parent
and Purchaser may extend the Offer to expire at 11:59 p.m. New York City time
on May 24, 2018. 

(iii) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall extend the Offer or provide a
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in any manner other than in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_ without the prior written consent of the
Company.

 

(iv) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, in which case Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one (1) business day)
after such termination of this Agreement.

(f) _Payment for Company Common Stock_. On the terms of and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all shares
of Company Common Stock that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the expiration of the Offer (as it
may be extended in accordance with _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_) (or, at Parents
election, concurrently with the expiration of the Offer if all conditions to
the Offer have been satisfied or waived) (such time of acceptance, the "
_Acceptance Time_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the
funds and shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to pay for any shares of
Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that without the prior written consent
of the Company, Purchaser shall not accept for payment, or pay for, any shares
of Company Common Stock if, as a result, Purchaser would acquire less than the
shares of Company Common Stock necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition.
The consideration in the Offer payable in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
shall be paid promptly following the Acceptance Time net to the holder
thereof in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock, as applicable, without
interest and subject to reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes payable
in respect thereof.

 

(g) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents; Form S-4_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is first commenced (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), Parent and
Purchaser shall:

(A) prepare and file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer, which
Schedule TO shall contain as an exhibit the Offer to Purchase and forms of the
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any, and other customary
ancillary documents, in each case, in respect of the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ");

 



-5- (B) deliver a copy of the Schedule TO, including all exhibits thereto, to the
Company at its principal executive offices in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act;

(C) give telephonic notice of the information required by Rule 14d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and mail by means of first class mail a
copy of the Schedule TO, to the NYSE in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; and

 

(D) subject to the Companys compliance with _Section 1.2_, cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Common Stock as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act.

(ii) Concurrently with the filing of the Offer Documents, Parent shall file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register under the
Securities Act the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
and the Merger (the " _Form S-4_ "). The Form S-4 will include a
preliminary prospectus containing the information required under Rule
14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(iii) The Offer Documents and the Form S-4 may include a description of the
determinations, approvals and recommendations of the Company Board of
Directors set forth in _Section 1.2(a)_ that relate to the Offer, unless the
Company Board of Directors has effected a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with _Section 6.3_. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that
the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act and Securities Act and (C) keep the Form S-4, if the Form
S-4 is declared effective by the SEC, effective for so long as necessary to
complete the Merger. The Company shall furnish in writing to Parent and

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 

Section 3.1. _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the Company or of Purchaser, subject to _Section 1.1(a)_
and any applicable withholding Tax, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Cancelled Shares, any Converted Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall
be automatically converted into the right to receive the Offer Consideration
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to the provisions of this  _Article
III_. From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the applicable portion of Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.2_, including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 3.6_, cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such
shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this _Section
3.1(a)_ (the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the
amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_.

 



-10- (b) _Certain Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is owned or held in treasury by the Company or is owned by
Parent or Purchaser shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (collectively, the "
_Cancelled Shares_ "). At the Effective Time, any shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than
Purchaser) or of the Company (the " _Converted Shares_ ") shall be converted
into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company ("
_Surviving Company Stock_ ") equal to the product of (i) (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock held by such Subsidiary immediately prior to
the Effective Time, _divided by_ (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the total
number of shares of Surviving Company Stock outstanding immediately after the
consummation of the Merger.

 

(c) _Treatment of Purchaser Shares_. At the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser
(the " _Purchaser Shares_ ") shall be automatically converted into and become
one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Surviving Company Stock. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing Purchaser Shares
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of
Surviving Company Stock into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent
Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time. Nothing in this  _Section 3.1(d) _shall be construed to permit the
Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 3.2. _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company Stockholders for
the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At
or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ in book-entry form equal to the
aggregate Parent Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding
any Fractional Share Consideration) and (ii) cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, including the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance
with  _Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions under _Section
3.2(f)_ (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions with

 



-11-  respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock; _provided_ that no such
deposits shall be required to be made with respect to any Dissenting Shares.
In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient (other than as a result
of payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement) to
pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration, including the
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6_ and any
dividends or other distributions under _Section 3.2(f)_, Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the
Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the shortfall that is required to
make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the
Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration,
including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section 3.6_, and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.2(f)_ out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided
for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested
by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to
direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper
rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article III_. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Company Common Stock Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") and whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to 
_Section 3.1_ into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter
of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration into which such shares of
Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with  _Section 3.2(f)_. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if
required by Parent, an indemnity bond) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with
such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger
Consideration pursuant to the

 



-12-  provisions of this _Article III_, including any Fractional Share
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 3.6_, and any amounts that such holder has the right
to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_ for each share of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall
accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if
required by Parent, an indemnity bond) upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid
or is not required to be paid.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of or non-certificated Company Common
Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_") and whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of
one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time the
applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
III_, including any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 3.6_, and any amounts
that such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section
3.2(f)_ for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Book-Entry Share, and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall be forthwith
cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered.

 

(iii) _No Interest_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the
Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 3.2(e)_) or in respect of
any Book-Entry Share.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Common Stock on the records of the Company. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_,
except as otherwise provided in _Section 3.3_. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement. 

 



-13- (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not
been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_, payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
in accordance with _Section 3.2(e)_) or Book-Entry Shares and compliance
with the procedures in _Section 3.2(b)_, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parent, the Company, Purchaser,
the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and,
if required by Parent, an indemnity bond, the applicable Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.1_, including any amount
payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with 
_Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_.

 

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent,
an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Share there shall be paid to the holder
thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

Section 3.3. _Dissenter s Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has
not tendered in the Offer and has properly exercised appraisal rights in
respect of such shares in accordance with Section 262 

 



-14-  of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting
Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law with
respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment for such shares
determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_
, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws
or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such Book-
Entry Shares, as the case may be. 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, of any
withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served pursuant to
the DGCL and received by the Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL, and
Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.4. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (whether vested or unvested)
held by any former employee or former service provider (other than a former
non-employee director) of the Company shall, in each case, without any action
on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with
the holder of such Company Option becoming entitled to receive within
five (5) business days, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect thereto, an amount in cash equal to (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess (if any) of the Per Share Cash
Equivalent Consideration over the per share exercise price applicable to the
Company Option.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than a Company
Option covered by _Section 3.4(a)_ or _Section 3.4(c)_) shall, without any
action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall
be assumed and converted automatically into an option to purchase the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") equal to the
product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_by_ (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded
down to the nearest whole share. Each Adjusted Option shall have an
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to (i) the per share
exercise price for shares of Company Common Stock subject to the corresponding
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (ii) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each
Adjusted Option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
applicable to the corresponding Company Option under the applicable Company
Equity Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including
vesting terms.

 



-15- (c) At the Effective Time, each Company Equity Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a current or
former non-employee director of the Company will vest as of the Effective Time
and shall, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder
thereof, be cancelled, with the holder of such Company Equity Award becoming
entitled to receive within five (5) business days (or such later date required
by Section 409A of the Code), in full satisfaction of the rights of such
holder with respect thereto, the Merger Consideration in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Equity Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time, with the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to any Company Option reduced by the

(d) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU (other than any Company RSU
covered by _Section 3.4(c)_) and each Company PSU that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action on the part
of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed and
converted automatically into a restricted stock unit or performance share
unit, as applicable, with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(each, an " _Adjusted RSU_ ") equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_
 (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the
Company RSU or Company PSU, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective
Time _by_ (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares
rounded up to the nearest whole share. Each Adjusted RSU shall otherwise be
subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding
Company RSU or Company PSU, as applicable, under the applicable Company Equity
Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting
terms.

(e) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take
all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide

participant in the Company ESPP; (ii) subject to the consummation of the
Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate effective immediately prior to the

is still in effect at the Effective Time, then the last day of such Current
ESPP Offering Period shall be accelerated to a date before the Closing Date as
specified by the Company Board of Directors or its designated committee in

after the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form), to the extent such form is available, relating to the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Adjusted Options and
Adjusted RSUs. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or statements for so long as

Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts
as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such payment under
the Code, or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld, and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

Section 3.6. _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock  _multiplied by_ the Parent Trading Price,
rounded to the nearest cent.

Section 4.26. _No Other Representations_. In connection with the due
diligence investigation of Parent and Purchaser by the Company, the Company
has received and may continue to receive from Parent or Purchaser certain
forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan and cost-
related plan information, regarding Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries and their
respective business and operations. The Company hereby acknowledges that there

letter delivered by Parent to the Company immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood
that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the representation
and warranty set forth in this Agreement to which it corresponds in number
and, whether or not an explicit reference or cross-reference is made, each
other representation and warranty set forth in this _Article V_ for which it

adjustment is made;

 



-54- (d) adopt a plan of complete or partial liquidation or dissolution with
respect to Parent;

 

(e) subject to _Section 7.2_, take or cause to be taken any action that would
reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the Transactions on or
before the Outside Date; or

(f) agree or authorize, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing
actions. 

Section 6.3. _Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Acceptance Time or
the date, if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 9.1_, the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause the
Companys controlled affiliates not to, and shall cause its and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of
providing information or taking any other action) any inquiry, proposal or
offer, or the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal or
offer which constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any person any nonpublic information relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with an actual or potential Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to
adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) withdraw,
change, amend, modify or qualify, or otherwise propose to withdraw, change,
amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation, or commit or agree to take any such action, (v) if an
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed, fail to publicly
recommend against any such Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) business days
after the public disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal (or subsequently
withdraw, change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent,
such rejection of such Acquisition Proposal) and reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within such ten (10) business day period (or, with respect to
any material amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such
previously publicly disclosed Acquisition Proposal that are publicly
disclosed within the last five (5) business days prior to the then-scheduled
expiration of the Offer, fail to take the actions referred to in this clause
(v), with references to the applicable ten (10) business day period being
replaced with three (3) business days), (vi) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, (vii) approve, or authorize, or cause or
permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into, any merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, reorganization agreement, letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar agreement or
document relating to, or any other agreement or commitment providing for, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.3_) (a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (viii) commit or agree to do any of the
foregoing (any act described in clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and
(viii) (to the extent related to the foregoing clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi)
or (vii)), a " _Change of_

 



-55-   _Recommendation_ "). The Company shall, and shall cause the Companys
controlled affiliates to, and shall cause its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing solicitation,
discussions or negotiations with any persons (or provision of any nonpublic
information to any persons) with respect to any inquiry, proposal or offer
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. Promptly after the date hereof (and in any event within two (2)
business days following the date hereof), the Company shall (A) request in
writing that each person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal promptly destroy or
return to the Company all nonpublic information heretofore furnished by the
Company or any of its Representatives to such person or any of its
Representatives in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement
and (B) terminate access to any physical or electronic data rooms relating to
a possible Acquisition Proposal by any such person. The Company shall
enforce, and not waive, terminate or modify without Parents prior written
consent, any confidentiality, standstill or similar provision in any
confidentiality, standstill or other agreement; _provided_ that, if the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to waive a particular
standstill provision would reasonably be expected to be a breach of the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may, with prior
written notice to Parent, waive such standstill solely to the extent necessary
to permit the applicable person (if it has not been solicited in violation of
this _Section 6.3_) to make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board of
Directors, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such person agreeing to
disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent, in each case as
contemplated by this _Section 6.3_. For purposes of this _Section 6.3_, the
term "person" means any Person or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the Company, Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary or any of their Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.3_ by any of the
Companys controlled affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
shall be a breach of this  _Section 6.3_ by the Company. Notwithstanding the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_, if the Company receives, prior to
the Acceptance Time, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and the Companys Representatives may contact the Person or any
of its Representatives who has made such Acquisition Proposal solely to
clarify the terms of such Acquisition Proposal so that the Company may inform
itself about such Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
notices required to be made to Parent pursuant to this  _Section 6.3_ shall
not, in and of themselves, be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_, if the
Company receives, prior to the Acceptance Time, a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_,
which the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (i) after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with the Companys outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, then the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic
information with respect to the Company to the person making such Acquisition
Proposal (and its Representatives), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing
such information, the Company

 



-56-  receives from such person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
and the Company also provides Parent, prior to or substantially concurrently
with the time such information is provided or made available to such person,
any non-public information furnished to such other person that was not
previously furnished to Parent, (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives), and (z) if and limited solely to the extent required in
order to comply with the Companys obligations under an applicable Antitrust
Law (with respect to which the failure to comply would reasonably be expected
to be material to the Company), make filings under such Antitrust Law
required to be made by the Company in response to such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent of any receipt by any director or officer of the Company
or by any of the Companys controlled affiliates or its or their respective
Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal or any proposals or inquiries that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary by any person who has made or could reasonably be
expected to make any Acquisition Proposal (or of becoming aware of any of its
or their other affiliates having received any such Acquisition Proposal,
proposal, inquiry or request). Such notice shall indicate the identity of the
person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, and the material
terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the nature of the
information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request, including
unredacted copies of all written requests, proposals or offers, including
proposed agreements received by the Company or, if such Acquisition Proposal
is not in writing, a reasonably detailed written description of the material
terms and conditions thereof. Without limiting the Companys other obligations
under this _Section 6.3_, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed
on a prompt and timely basis of the status and material terms (including any
amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms) of any such
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis as to the nature of any
information requested of the Company with respect thereto. Without limiting
the Companys other obligations under this _Section 6.3_, the Company shall
promptly provide (and in any event within the earlier of (i) forty-eight (48)
hours and (ii) one (1) business day) to Parent any material nonpublic
information concerning the Company provided to any other person in connection
with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours after such determination) inform Parent in
writing if the Company determines to begin providing information or to engage
in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
_Section 6.3(b)_. Unless this Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant
to _Section 9.1_, the Company shall not take any action to exempt any person
other than Parent or Purchaser from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in any applicable Takeover Statute or in the Company
Governing Documents, or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply. The
Company agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any
agreement with any person which directly or indirectly prohibits the Company
from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or otherwise
complying with, this _Section 6.3_.

 



-57- (d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.3_ to the contrary, but
subject to  _Section 6.3(e)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company Board of Directors may (i) make a Change of Recommendation (only of
the type contemplated by _Section 6.3(a)(iv)_ or _Section 6.3(a)(vi)_)
in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be a breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii)
make a Change of Recommendation and cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 9.1(g)_ in order to
enter into a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal (that
did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_), which the Company Board
of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisors is a Superior Proposal, but only
if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be a breach of the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement
unless this Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with _Section
9.1(g)_. " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, change or development first
occurring or arising after the date hereof that is material to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) and was not known by
or reasonably foreseeable to the Company Board of Directors as of the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the following events,
changes or developments constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt,
existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto
or consequence thereof or (B) changes in the market price or trading volume of
the Class A Common Stock, the Parent Common Stock or any other securities of
the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, or any change in credit
rating or the fact that the Company meets or exceeds (or that Parent fails to
meet or exceed) internal or published estimates, projections, forecasts or
predictions for any period.

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
6.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) business days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor,
and during such four (4) business day period, the Company shall cause its
Representatives (including its executive officers) to be available to
negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a
manner that would obviate the need to effect a Change of Recommendation and at
the end of such four (4) business day period the Company Board of Directors
again makes the determination under _Section 6.3(d)(i)_ (after in good faith
taking into account any amendments proposed by Parent) or (ii) under _Section
6.3(d)(ii)_, the Company shall provide Parent with four (4) business
days prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of
Directors intends to take such action and specifying the material terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of any proposed
definitive documentation, and during such four (4) business day period, the
Company shall cause its Representatives (including its executive officers) to
be available to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal and at the end of such four (4) business day period the
Company Board of Directors again makes the determination under  _Section
6.3(d)(ii)_ (after in good faith taking into account the amendments proposed
by Parent). With respect to _Section 6.3(e)(ii)_, if there are any material
amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such Superior Proposal
(including any revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration the
Company Stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal), the
Company shall comply again with _Section 6.3(e)(ii)_ with references to
the applicable four (4) business day period being replaced by two (2)
business days.

 



-58- (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board
of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
any similar statement in response to any publicly disclosed Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that any "stop, look and listen" statement, or any such
similar statement, also includes an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 6.3(f)_ shall not
permit the Company Board of Directors to make (or otherwise modify
the definition of) a Change of Recommendation except to the extent expressly
permitted by _Section 6.3(d)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 7.1. _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date,
if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to  _Section
9.1_, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall
cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and Parents
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries
offices, properties, Contracts, personnel, books and records and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, furnish
reasonably promptly to Parent all information (financial or otherwise)
concerning its business, properties and personnel available to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or prepared by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
the normal course of its business as Parent may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required by this
_Section 7.1_ to provide Parent or Parents Representatives with access to or
to disclose information (i) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date hereof or after
the date hereof in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such third
party to such access or disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate
substitute arrangements to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in
violation of such consent requirement), (ii) the disclosure of which would
violate Law ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of Law) or (iii) that is
subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege
( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow for such disclosure to the maximum extent that
does not result in a loss of such attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege). Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize to the extent reasonably practicable any unnecessary disruption to
the businesses the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that may result from
the requests for access, data and information hereunder.

  



-59- (b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.1_, in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, (ii) of any legal
proceeding commenced or, to such Partys knowledge, threatened against such
Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating
to, involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or

relating to the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction, and (iii) upon
becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or
circumstance relating to it or any Company Subsidiary or Parent Subsidiary,
respectively, that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be, or which would reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_
, _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section
7.1(c)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty hereunder
or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party.

 

Section 7.2. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, including the Offer and the
Merger, as soon as practicable after the date hereof, including (i) preparing
and filing or otherwise providing, in consultation with the other Party and
as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all
documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions,

waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Transactions, including the
Offer and the Merger, and (ii) taking all steps as may be necessary, subject
to the limitations in this _Section 7.2_, to obtain all such waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses,
registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to (x) make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within ten (10) business days after the execution of this Agreement (unless a
later date is mutually agreed between the Parties), and to supply as promptly
as practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary
materials that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other
actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under

 



-60-  the HSR Act as soon as practicable and (y) make all other necessary filings
as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and to supply as promptly as
practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary
materials that may be requested under any Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, Purchaser or any
of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to, and the Company may
not and may not permit any Subsidiary to, without the prior written consent of
Parent, become subject to, consent to or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (A) sell, license, assign,
transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business
or portion of business of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent,
Purchaser or any Subsidiary of any of the foregoing, (B) conduct, restrict,
operate, invest or otherwise change the assets, the business or portion of the
business of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent, Purchaser or any
Subsidiary of any of the foregoing in any manner or (C) impose any
restriction, requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or
portion of the business of the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent,
Purchaser or any Subsidiary of any of the foregoing; _provided_ that if
requested by Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries will become subject to,
consent to or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to,
any such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order
so long as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement
or order is only binding on the Company or its Subsidiaries in the event the
Closing occurs.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with and without
limiting the efforts referenced in _Section 7.2(a)_ to obtain all waiting
period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses,
orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for the
Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate
in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, including by allowing
the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and
comment on drafts of filings and submissions and reasonably considering in
good faith comments of the other party, (ii) promptly inform the other Party
of any communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to,
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity, by
promptly providing copies to the other Party of any such written
communications, and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions and (iii) permit the other Party to review in advance any
communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or
any other Governmental Entity, or, in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ,
the FTC or other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person
meetings, substantive telephone calls or conferences with the DOJ, the FTC or
other Governmental Entity or other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials required to be provided pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i)-(iii)
may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent,
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements and (C) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege or confidentiality concerns; _provided_ , _further,_ that each of
Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this _Section 7.2(b)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material."

 



-61- (c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties
shall give any notices to third parties required under Contracts, and each of
the Parties shall use, and cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to use,
its reasonable best efforts to obtain any Contractual third party consents
that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any consent or other similar fee, payment or
consideration, make any other concession or provide any additional security
(including a guaranty), to obtain such third party consents (except, in the
case of the Company, if requested by Parent and either (a) reimbursed
or indemnified for by Parent or (b) subject to the occurrence of the
Acceptance Time).

Section 7.3. _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement or
disclosure with respect to the Offer, the Merger, the other Transactions or
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, unless
such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is
required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the
listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or
cause the publication of such press release or other public announcement or
disclosure with respect to the Offer, the Merger, the other Transactions or
this Agreement, in which event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis
reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the
other Party to review and comment upon such press release or other
announcement or disclosure in advance and shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto; _provided,
however,_ that (a) neither Party shall be required by this _Section 7.3_ to
provide any such review or comment to the other in connection with the
Companys receipt (and the existence of) an Acquisition Proposal or a Change
of Recommendation and matters directly related thereto and (b) the Parties
shall not be required by this _Section 7.3_ to provide any such review or
comment to the other Party to the extent such release, announcement or
disclosure relates to any dispute between the Parties relating to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that each Party and their
respective Subsidiaries and Representatives may make statements that are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this _Section
7.3_.

 

Section 7.4. _D andO Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless
all past and present directors and officers of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs
or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses prior to the
final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents; _provided_ that
such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a
court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, nonappealable judgment
that such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines,

 



-62-  losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or
proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions),
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in
connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director, employee or
other fiduciary of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or of any other
Person if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
and the Company Governing Documents or the organizational documents of the
applicable Company Subsidiary (as applicable) or any indemnification
agreements with such persons in existence on the date of this Agreement and
provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that
all rights to elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement
of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as
provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) or in any indemnification agreement in
existence on the date of this Agreement and provided to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies the
Surviving Company on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
of a matter in respect of which such Person intends in good faith to seek
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.4_, the provisions of this
_Section 7.4_ shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until
the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and
proceedings relating thereto.

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents and
(ii) any indemnification agreement of the Company or a Company Subsidiary with
any Indemnified Party in existence on the date of this Agreement and provided
to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, except to the extent such
agreement provides for an earlier termination, in each case, regarding
elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and
employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date
hereof, and no such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged
to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions).

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six
(6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing coverage
retentions, limits and other material terms substantially equivalent to the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not commit or spend on such "tail"
policy, in the aggregate, more than two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of
the last aggregate annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof
for the Companys current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Base Amount_ "), and if
the cost of such

 



-63-  "tail" policy would otherwise exceed the Base Amount, the Company shall be
permitted to purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for the Base
Amount. The Company shall in good faith cooperate with Parent prior to the
Acceptance Time with respect to the procurement of such "tail" policy,
including with respect to the selection of the broker, available policy price
and coverage options.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and, in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.4_. The rights and obligations under this _Section
7.4_ shall survive consummation of the Offer and the Merger and shall not be
terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party
without the written consent of such Indemnified Party. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 7.4_, each of whom may enforce the provisions thereof.

 

Section 7.5. _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tender and Support
Agreements) and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Tender and Support Agreements) may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or
minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions. No Change of Recommendation shall change, or be deemed to
change, or permit the Company or the Company Board of Directors to change, in
any manner or respect the approval of the Company Board of Directors for
purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the Merger or
any of the other Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Tender and Support Agreements).

Section 7.6. _Obligations of Purchaser_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Purchaser and the Surviving Company to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 7.7. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall assume, honor and fulfill all of the Company Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof
or as subsequently amended or terminated as permitted pursuant to the terms of
such Company Benefit Plans and this Agreement. Effective as of the Effective
Time and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Parent shall provide
to each employee of the Company and Company Subsidiary who continues to be
employed by Parent or any Subsidiary thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "),
(i) at least the same wage rate or base salary as in effect for
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) employee
benefits (including cash bonus opportunities,

 



-64-  retirement, health and welfare benefits, but excluding equity incentive
compensation) that are, in the aggregate, in Parents discretion, either (A)
no less favorable to such Continuing Employee than those in effect for such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing or (B) no less favorable
than those in effect for similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of
the Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Continuing
Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing
Employee shall, subject to applicable law and applicable tax qualification
requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is of the same
type as the Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) (A) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee,
Parent or its applicable Subsidiary shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents and (B) Parent and its applicable Subsidiary
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) If, at least ten (10) business days prior to the Effective Time, Parent
provides written notice to the Company directing the Company to terminate its
401(k) plan(s), the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans effective
as of the day immediately preceding the day on which the Effective Time occurs
(the " _401(k) Termination Date_ "). In the event that Parent requests that
such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent that such 401(k) plan(s) have been
terminated pursuant to resolution of the Companys Board of Directors at
least two (2) business days prior to the day on which the Effective Time
occurs; _provided_ that prior to terminating the Companys 401(k) plan, the
Company shall provide Parent with the form and substance of any applicable
resolutions for review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Company 401(k) plan is terminated
pursuant to this _Section 7.7(c)_, then as soon as practicable following the
401(k) Termination Date, Parent shall permit all Continuing Employees who were
eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) plan immediately prior to the
401(k) Termination Date to participate in Parents 401(k) plan, and shall
permit each such Continuing Employee to elect to transfer his or her account
balance when distributed from the terminated Company 401(k) plan, including
any outstanding participant loans, to Parents 401(k) plan, except to the
extent accepting such transfers would adversely affect the tax-qualified
status of Parents 401(k) plan or as may be prohibited by Parents 401(k)
plan.

 



-65- (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent or any affiliate of
Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent or
any affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to
discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing Employee at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent
expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the
Company or any affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or
any severance, benefit or other applicable plan or program covering such
Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 7.7_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to
be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee
benefit plan of Parent or Purchaser or (ii) create any third party rights in
any current or former service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or
any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 7.8. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity
securities pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.9. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall provide Parent prompt
notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder of the Company against
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors
or officers relating to the Offer, the Merger and any of the other
Transactions or this Agreement, and shall keep Parent informed on a prompt
and timely basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense or
settlement of any such litigation and reasonably cooperate with Parent in
conducting the defense or settlement of such litigation, and no such
settlement shall be agreed without Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Parent
shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include a
full release of Parent and its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or
other equitable relief after the Effective Time upon Parent or any of its
affiliates. In the event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap
between the provisions of this _Section 7.9_ and _Section 6.1_ or _Section
7.2_, the provisions of this _Section 7.9_ shall control.

 

Section 7.10. _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist the Class A Common Stock from the NYSE and terminate its registration
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall
not be effective until after the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.11. _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent resignations executed by each
director of the Company in office as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and effective upon the Effective Time.

 



-66- Section 7.12. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Offer
and the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance.

 

Section 7.13. _14d-10 Matters_. The Parties acknowledge that certain payments
have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or
are to be granted according to employment compensation, severance and other
employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Benefit Plans
(collectively, the " _Arrangements_ "), to certain holders of Company Common
Stock and holders of Company Equity Awards. The Compensation Committee of the
Company Board of Directors (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ ") (a) at a
meeting to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, has duly adopted or will
duly adopt resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1)
under the Exchange Act (i) each Arrangement presented to the Company
Compensation Committee on or prior to the date hereof, (ii) the treatment of
the Company Equity Awards, as applicable, in accordance with the terms set
forth in this Agreement and (iii) the terms of _Section 7.4_ and  _Section
7.7_ and (b) will take all other actions necessary to satisfy the requirements
of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act with respect to the foregoing arrangements. The Company represents and
warrants that each member of the Company Compensation Committee is an
"independent director" in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.14. _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, and shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their Representatives to, provide all customary
cooperation and all customary financial information, in each case that is
reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser in connection with any financing
(the " _Financing_ ") obtained by Parent or Purchaser for the purpose of
financing the transactions contemplated hereby or any transaction undertaken
in connection therewith (it being understood that the receipt of any such
financing is not a condition to the Merger); _provided_ , _however_ , that
(a) no such cooperation shall be required to the extent it would (i)
unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the Companys business, (ii) require the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries to incur any fees, expenses or other
liability prior to the Acceptance Time for which it is not promptly reimbursed
or simultaneously indemnified, (iii) be reasonably expected to cause any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
incur any material personal liability, (iv) require the Company to waive or
amend any terms of this Agreement or (v) require the Company to provide any
information that is prohibited or restricted by applicable Law or is legally
privileged ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of Law or to allow for such
access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of
such legal privilege); and (b) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall
not be required to execute any credit or security documentation or any other
definitive agreement or provide any indemnity prior to the Acceptance Time.

CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER

The respective obligations of each Party to effect the Merger shall be

TERMINATION

 

Section 9.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned, at any time before

material breach of this Agreement and (ii) (A) Parent and/or Purchaser shall
have breached, failed to perform or violated in any material respect their
respective covenants or agreements under this Agreement, or (B) any of the
representations and warranties of Parent or Purchaser set forth in this

effect to any qualification as to materiality or Parent Material Adverse
Effect contained therein) would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, prior to the Outside Date,
and in each of clauses (A) and (B) such breach, failure to perform, violation
or inaccuracy is not capable of being cured by the Outside Date or, if capable

violation or inaccuracy;

  



-68- (c) by Parent, in the event that (i) neither Parent nor Purchaser is then in
material breach of this Agreement and (ii) (A) the Company shall have
breached, failed to perform or violated its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement or (B) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall have become inaccurate, in either case of
clauses (A) or (B) in a manner that would give rise to the right of Parent and
Purchaser not to accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to clause (F)(1) or (F)(2) of _Annex C_ (assuming the
expiration of the Offer as of such time) and such breach, failure to perform,
violation or inaccuracy is not capable of being cured by the Outside Date or,
if capable of being cured by the Outside Date, is not cured by the Company
before the earlier of (x) the business day immediately prior to the Outside
Date and (y) the thirtieth (30th) calendar day following receipt of written

inaccuracy;

(d) by either Parent or the Company (A) if the Offer shall have terminated or
expired in accordance with its terms (subject to the rights and obligations of
Parent or Purchaser to extend the Offer pursuant to _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_)
without Purchaser having accepted for payment any shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d)(A) shall not be available to Parent
if Parent or Purchaser shall have failed to comply in any material respect
with its obligations under _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_ or (B) if the Acceptance Time
has not occurred on or before the date that is six (6) months after the date
hereof (the " _Outside Date_ ");  _provided_ that (x) if, on the Outside
Date, all of the conditions to the Offer, other than the conditions set forth
in clauses (B) and (C) (to the extent any such injunction or order is in
respect of, or any such Law is, the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law) of
_Annex C_ and those conditions to the Offer that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the expiration of the Offer (if such conditions (other than the
Minimum Condition) would be satisfied or validly waived were the expiration
of the Offer to occur at such time), shall have been satisfied or waived, then
the Outside Date shall automatically be extended for all purposes hereunder by
a period of two (2) months and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)(B)_ shall not be available to any Party
whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been a proximate cause of the failure to close contemplated hereby and
such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement;

(e) by Parent, if, prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company Board of
Directors shall have effected a Change of Recommendation or (ii) the Company
has materially breached _Section 6.3_;

 

(f)by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction,
decree or ruling in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions; or

 

(g) by the Company in order to effect a Change of Recommendation and
substantially concurrently enter into a definitive agreement providing for a

-69- Section 9.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Section 9.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the
Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 9.2_ and
_Section 10.3_ through _Section 10.12_ shall survive such termination;
_provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability
for fraud or willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _willful breach_ " shall mean a deliberate
action taken or deliberate failure to act that the breaching party
intentionally takes (or fails to take) and actually knows would, or would
reasonably be expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement.

(b) _Termination Fee_.

(i) If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to (I)
_Section 9.1(d)(B)_ (1) solely due to the failure to satisfy the Minimum
Condition prior to such termination or (2) at a time when Parent would be
permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to (x) _Section
9.1(c)(ii)(A)_ due to a breach, failure to perform or violation described in
such Section that occurred following the making of such Acquisition Proposal
or (y) _Section 9.1(e)(ii)_ or (II) _Section 9.1(d)(A)_, (B) after the date
hereof and prior to the date of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is
publicly disclosed (whether by the Company or a third party) and not publicly
withdrawn at least three (3) business days prior to such termination, and (C)
within twelve (12) months of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is
subsequently consummated or a definitive agreement providing for an
Acquisition Proposal is entered into, on or prior to the date that is the
earlier of (x) the date such Acquisition Proposal is consummated and (y) the
date of entry of such definitive agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent a
fee of $187,000,000 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ").

 

(ii) If (A) after the date hereof and prior to the termination of this
Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company Board of Directors
or the Companys management or becomes publicly disclosed (whether by the
Company or a third party) and not publicly withdrawn at least three (3)
business days prior to such termination, (B) the Company shall have
breached, failed to perform or violated its covenants or agreements under
this Agreement such that Parent has a right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to (I) _Section 9.1(c)(ii)(A)_ due to such breach, failure to
perform or violation ( _provided_ that such breach, failure to perform or
violation occurred following the making of such Acquisition Proposal) or (II)
_Section 9.1(e)(ii)_, (C) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_ Section 9.1(c)(ii)(A)_ or _Section 9.1(e)(ii)_ and (D) within twelve (12)
months of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is subsequently
consummated or a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal
is entered into, on or prior to the date that is the earlier of (x) the date
such Acquisition Proposal is consummated and (y) the date of entry of such
definitive agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

 



-70- (iii) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to (A) _Section
9.1(e)(i)_ or (B) _Section 9.1(e)(ii)_ (in the case of this clause (B) if
the Company has materially and willfully breached _Section 6.3_), within two
(2) business days after such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent
the Termination Fee.

(iv) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_,
substantially concurrently with or prior to (and as a condition to) such
termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the
Termination Fee.

(v) In the event any amount is payable by the Company pursuant to the
preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), such amount shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent. Parent shall promptly provide wire transfer instructions in writing
to the Company upon request (and in any event with sufficient time to allow
the Company to pay or cause to be paid to Parent any Termination Fee payable
hereunder within the time periods required by this  _Section 9.2(b)_). For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(vi) Solely for purposes of _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ and _Section 9.2(b)(ii)_,
the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in _Annex A_, except that all references to "fifteen percent (15%)" and
"eighty-five percent (85%)" therein shall be deemed to be references to "fifty
percent (50%)." 

(c) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
9.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, the Parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. Each Party
further acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Purchaser in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, if the Company fails to
pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_, then (i)
the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including
disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue
amounts, including in connection with any related claims, actions or
proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on the
amounts payable pursuant to  _Section 9.2(b)_ from and including the date
payment of such amounts were due to but excluding the date of actual payment
at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, upon Parents receipt of the full Termination Fee
(and any other amounts contemplated by this _Section 9.2(c)_) pursuant to
this _Section 9.2_ in circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable,
none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,
members, affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except for
fraud or willful breach (as defined in _Section 9.2(a)_).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
below and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to
be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

 



B-1-1 ARTICLE I

 

AGREEMENT TO TENDER AND VOTE

 

1.1. _Agreement to Tender_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, unless and
until this Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.2,_ each Stockholder agrees to validly and irrevocably
tender or cause to be validly and irrevocably tendered in the Offer all of
such Stockholders Subject Shares (other than (x) Company Options that are
not exercised during the term of this Agreement and (y) Company RSUs that do
not vest during the term of this Agreement) pursuant to and in accordance with
the terms of the Offer, free and clear of all Encumbrances (as defined below)
except for Permitted Encumbrances (as defined below). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, promptly after the Tender Notice (as defined
below), but in no event later than the last time at which the depositary can
accept tenders prior to the expiration of the Offer, each Stockholder shall
validly and irrevocably tender or cause to be validly and irrevocably tendered
in the Offer all of such Stockholders Subject Shares free and clear of all
Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances, including by delivering
pursuant to the terms of the Offer (a) a letter of transmittal with respect to
all of such Stockholders Subject Shares complying with the terms of the
Offer, (b) a certificate representing all such Subject Shares that are
certificated or, in the case of a book-entry share of any uncertificated
Subject Shares, written instructions to such Stockholders broker, dealer or
other nominee that such Subject Shares be tendered, including a reference to
this Agreement, and requesting delivery of an "agents message" (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)
and (c) all other documents or instruments reasonably required to be
delivered by other Company stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Offer (it
being understood that this sentence shall not apply to (x) Company Options
that are not exercised during the term of this Agreement and (y) Company RSUs
that do not vest during the term of this Agreement). Each Stockholder agrees
that, once any of such Stockholders Subject Shares are tendered, such
Stockholder will not withdraw such Subject Shares from the Offer, unless and
until this Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.2_. In the event this Agreement has been validly terminated
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, __ Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, promptly return to the Stockholder all Subject
Shares such Stockholder tendered in the Offer. At all times commencing with
the date hereof and continuing until the valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, each Stockholder shall not tender any of such
Stockholders Subject Shares into any tender or exchange offer commenced by a
Person other than Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent. For
purposes hereof, a "Tender Notice" means a written notice, delivered by Parent
or Purchaser to each Stockholder on the date of the expiration of the Offer
(as soon as practicable following 1:00 p.m. New York City time on such
expiration date but in no event later than one hour prior to the last time at
which the depositary can accept tenders prior to the expiration), specifying
that (i) all of the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied (or are
reasonably expected to be satisfied as of the expiration of the Offer) or
waived by Purchaser (to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement) (it
being understood that such written notice can only be validly delivered
by Parent or Purchaser to the extent that all of the conditions to the Offer
have, in fact, been satisfied (or are reasonably expected to be satisfied as
of the expiration of the Offer) or otherwise waived by Purchaser (to the
extent permitted by the Merger Agreement)); _provided_ that, for purposes of
the Tender Notice only, the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition shall be
tested assuming that all shares of Company Common Stock to be tendered
pursuant to Section 1.1 of this Agreement are tendered prior to the
expiration of the Offer and that the consummation of the Offer occurs
contemporaneously with the delivery of the Tender Notice. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Section 1.1 shall obligate Parent or Purchaser to
deliver a Tender Notice.

 



B-1-2 1.2. _Agreement to Vote_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, for so long
as this Agreement has not been validly terminated in accordance with its
terms, if Parent provides at least three (3) business days written notice to
such Stockholder that it has terminated, or elects not to use, the proxy
granted in _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, at any annual or special meeting of the
stockholders of the Company, however called, including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, and in connection with any action proposed to be taken
by written consent of the stockholders of the Company, such Stockholder shall,
in each case, to the fullest extent that such Stockholders Subject Shares are
entitled to vote thereon: (a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause
all such Subject Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of
determining a quorum and (b) be present (in person or by proxy) and vote (or
cause to be voted), or deliver (or cause to be delivered) a written consent
with respect to, all of its Subject Shares (i) against any action or agreement
that would reasonably be expected to (A) result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the
Company contained in the Merger Agreement, or of any Stockholder contained in
this Agreement, or (B) result in any of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII or Annex C of the Merger Agreement not being satisfied on or before the
Outside Date; (ii) against any change in the Company Board of Directors that
is not recommended by the Company Board of Directors; and (iii) against any
Acquisition Proposal. Subject to the proxy granted under _Section_ __ _
1.3_ below, each Stockholder shall retain at all times the right to vote such
Stockholders Subject Shares in such Stockholders sole discretion, and
without any other limitation, on any matters other than those expressly set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ that are at any time or from time to time
presented for consideration to the Companys stockholders generally. For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments in _Sections 1.1_ and _1.2_
 apply to any Subject Shares held by any trust, limited partnership or other
entity directly or indirectly holding Subject Shares over which the applicable
Stockholder exercises direct or indirect voting control.

 

1.3. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Solely with respect to the matters described in
_Section_ __ _ 1.2_, for so long as this Agreement has not been validly
terminated in accordance with its terms, each Stockholder hereby irrevocably
appoints Parent as its attorney and proxy with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, to the full extent of such Stockholders voting rights with
respect to all such Stockholders Subject Shares (which proxy is irrevocable
and which appointment is coupled with an interest, including for purposes of
Section 212 of the DGCL) to vote, and to execute written consents with
respect to, all such Stockholders Subject Shares solely on the matters
described in _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, and in accordance therewith. Each

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF EACH STOCKHOLDER

 

Each Stockholder represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser, as to such
Stockholder with respect to his, her or its own account and with respect to
its Subject Shares, on a several basis, that:

2.1. _Authorization; Binding Agreement_. If such Stockholder is not an
individual, such Stockholder is duly organized and validly existing in good
standing (where such concept is recognized) under the Laws of the jurisdiction
in which it is incorporated or constituted and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within such Stockholders entity powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary entity actions on the part of
such Stockholder, and such Stockholder has all requisite entity power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. If such Stockholder is an individual,
such Stockholder has all requisite legal capacity, right and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform such Stockholders
obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by such Stockholder and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder
in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations. If
such Stockholder is married, and any of such Stockholders Subject Shares
constitute community property or otherwise need spousal or other approval for
this Agreement to be legal, valid and binding, this Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by such Stockholders spouse and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Stockholders
spouse, enforceable against such Stockholders spouse in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations. 

2.2. _Non-Contravention_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by such Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders spouse) nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby nor compliance by such
Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders spouse) with any provisions
herein will (a) if such Stockholder is not an individual, violate, contravene
or conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws (or other similar governing documents) of such
Stockholder, (b) require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity on the part of such
Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders spouse), except for
compliance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or any other United States or federal securities laws and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (c) violate, conflict with, or
result in a breach of any provisions of, or require any consent, waiver or
approval or result in a default or loss of a benefit (or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration or any event
that, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would
constitute a default or give rise to any such right) under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Contract to

 



B-1-4  which such Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders spouse) is a
party or by which such Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders
spouse) or any of such Stockholders Subject Shares may be bound, (d) result
(or, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would
result) in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens)
on any asset of such Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders
spouse) (other than one created by Parent or Purchaser) or (e) violate any Law
applicable to such Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders spouse)
or by which any of such Stockholders Subject Shares are bound, except, in
the case of each of clauses (c), (d) and (e), as would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay or impair the consummation by such
Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
materially impair such Stockholders ability to perform its obligations
hereunder.

2.3.  _Ownership of Subject Shares; Total Shares_. Such Stockholder is the
record and beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act,
except that for purposes of Schedule A, all options, warrants, restricted
stock units and other similar securities are included even if not exercisable
within 60 days of the date hereof) of all of such Stockholders Subject Shares
and has good and marketable title to all of such Stockholders Subject Shares
free and clear of any Liens, claims, proxies, voting trusts or agreements,
options, rights, understandings or arrangements or any other encumbrances or
restrictions whatsoever on title, transfer or exercise of any rights of a
stockholder in respect of such Subject Shares (collectively, " _Encumbrances_
"), except for any such Encumbrance that may be imposed pursuant to (i) this
Agreement, (ii) any applicable restrictions on transfer under the Securities
Act or any state securities law, (iii) the Company Governing Documents, (iv)
that certain Sixth Amended and Restated Investors Rights Agreement, dated as
of May 13, 2015 and (v) any applicable Company Equity Plan or agreements
evidencing grants thereunder ((i) through (v), collectively, " _Permitted
Encumbrances_ "). The Subject Shares listed on _Schedule A_ opposite such
Stockholders name constitute all of the shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Options and Company RSUs and any other securities of the Company
beneficially owned by such Stockholder as of the date hereof.

 

2.4. _Voting Power_. Such Stockholder has full voting power with respect to
all such Stockholders Subject Shares (to the extent such Subject Shares have
voting rights), and full power of disposition with respect to such Subject
Shares to the extent they consist of vested shares of Company Common Stock,
full power to issue instructions with respect to the matters set forth herein
and full power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in
each case with respect to all such Stockholders Subject Shares. None of such
Stockholders Subject Shares are subject to any stockholders agreement,
proxy, voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or Encumbrance with
respect to the voting of such Subject Shares, except as expressly provided
herein (including the Permitted Encumbrances).

 

2.5. _Reliance_. Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent and
Purchaser are entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such
Stockholders execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.

2.6. _Absence of Litigation_. With respect to such Stockholder, as of the
date hereof, there is no Proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of
such Stockholder, threatened in writing against such Stockholder or any of
such Stockholders properties or assets 

 



B-1-5  (including any of such Stockholders Subject Shares) before or by any
Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay or impair the consummation by such Stockholder of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impair such
Stockholders ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

 

2.7. _Brokers_. No broker, finder, financial advisor, investment banker or
other Person is entitled to any brokerage, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission from Parent, Purchaser or the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of such Stockholder. __

4.1. _No Transfer; No Inconsistent Arrangements_.

 

(a) Each Stockholder hereby agrees that, from and after the date hereof and
until this Agreement is terminated, such Stockholder shall not, directly or
indirectly, take any action that would have the effect of preventing,
materially delaying or materially impairing such Stockholder from performing
any of its obligations under this Agreement or that would, or would reasonably
be expected to, have the effect of preventing, materially delaying or
materially impairing, the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the performance by the
Company of its obligations under the Merger Agreement.

 



B-1-6 (b) Except as provided hereunder (which, for clarity, includes the tendering

terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement), from and after the date
hereof and until this Agreement is terminated, such Stockholder shall not,
directly or indirectly, (i) create or permit to exist any Encumbrance, other
than Permitted Encumbrances, on any of such Stockholders Subject Shares, (ii)
transfer, sell, assign, gift, hedge, distribute, pledge or otherwise dispose

"Transfer" (for this purpose, as defined in the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Charter_ ")) or other

Common Stock into a share of Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section

arrangement with respect to (collectively, " _Transfer_ "), any of such

Shares. Any action taken in violation of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be null and void _ab initio_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
Stockholder may Transfer such Stockholders Subject Shares to a Permitted
Transferee (as defined in the Charter), but solely if and to the extent that
such Transfer would not result in the conversion under the Charter of such
Subject Shares that are shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common
Stock (any such Transfer and any Transfer as Parent may agree pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(d)_ below, a " _Permitted Transfer_ "), _provided_ , that
a Transfer described in this sentence shall be a Permitted Transfer only if
(x) all of the representations and warranties in this Agreement with respect
to such Stockholder would be true and correct upon such Transfer and (y) the
transferee of such Subject Shares, prior to the date of such Transfer, agrees
in a signed writing satisfactory to Parent (acting reasonably) to accept such
Subject Shares subject to the terms of this Agreement and to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement as a "Stockholder" for all purposes of this Agreement.
If any involuntary Transfer of any of such Stockholders Subject Shares in the
Company shall occur (including, but not limited to, a sale by such
Stockholders trustee in any bankruptcy, or a sale to a purchaser at any
creditors or court sale), the transferee (which term, as used herein, shall
include any and all transferees and subsequent transferees of the initial
transferee) shall, subject to applicable Law, take and hold such Subject
Shares subject to all of the restrictions, obligations, liabilities and rights
under this Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect until
valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(c) Unless and until this Agreement shall have been validly terminated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.2, _such Stockholder agrees that it shall
not, and shall cause each of its controlled affiliates not to, become a member
of a "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) for the
purpose of opposing or competing with or taking any actions inconsistent with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 4.1(b)_, such Stockholder may make

in its sole discretion.

irrevocably waives and agrees not to exercise any appraisal rights or
dissenters rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or otherwise in respect
of such Stockholders Subject Shares that may arise in connection with the
Offer or the Merger. 

4.3. _Documentation and Information_. Such Stockholder shall not make any
public announcement regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by
applicable Law (provided that reasonable notice of any such disclosure will
be provided to Parent, and such Stockholder will consider in good faith the
reasonable comments of Parent with respect to such disclosure and otherwise
cooperate with Parent in obtaining confidential treatment with respect to such
disclosure). Such Stockholder consents to and hereby authorizes Parent and
Purchaser to publish and disclose in all documents and schedules filed with
the SEC or any other Governmental Entity or applicable securities exchange,
and any press release or other disclosure document that Parent or Purchaser
reasonably determines to be necessary or advisable in connection with the
Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or this Agreement, such Stockholders identity and ownership of
such Stockholders Subject Shares, the existence of this Agreement and the
nature of such Stockholders commitments and obligations under this Agreement,
and such Stockholder acknowledges that Parent and Purchaser may, in Parents
sole discretion, file this Agreement or a form hereof with the SEC or any
other Governmental Entity or securities exchange. Such Stockholder agrees to
promptly give Parent any information it may reasonably require for
the preparation of any such disclosure documents, and such Stockholder agrees
to promptly notify Parent of any required corrections with respect to any
information supplied by such Stockholder specifically for use in any such
disclosure document, if and to the extent that any such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect.

4.4. _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend, merger,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or the like of the capital stock of the Company affecting a
Stockholders Subject Shares, the terms of this Agreement shall apply to the
resulting securities.

commence or participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of
any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or
otherwise, against Parent, Purchaser, the Company, any of their respective
affiliates or successors or any of their respective directors, managers or
officers (a) challenging the validity of, or seeking to enjoin or delay the
operation of, any provision of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement
(including any claim seeking to enjoin or delay the consummation of the Offer
or the closing of the Merger) or (b) alleging a breach of any duty of the
Company Board of Directors in connection with the Merger Agreement, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or hereby.

Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its controlled affiliates not to, and
shall cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or

inquiry, proposal or offer, or the making, submission or announcement of any
inquiry, proposal or offer which

Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any nonpublic information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with an actual or potential Acquisition Proposal, (iii) encourage
or recommend any other holder of Company Common Stock to not tender shares of

any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any letter of intent, support agreement
or similar document, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle relating
to or facilitating an Acquisition Proposal or (vi) agree to do any of the
foregoing. Each Stockholder shall, and shall cause its controlled affiliates
to, and shall cause its and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease any and all existing solicitation, discussions or negotiations with
any Person or groups (other than Parent, its Subsidiaries, and their
respective Representatives acting on their behalf) with respect to any
inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
4.6_, Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the
Merger Agreement, but shall also include any Transfer of any of such
Stockholders Subject Shares (other than a Permitted Transfer (disregarding
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(d)_ for this purpose)).

FORM OF TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT

 

This TENDER AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of March
20, 2018, is entered into by and among salesforce.com, inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Malbec Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and each of the
persons set forth on _Schedule A_  hereto (each, a " _Stockholder_ "). All
terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the
respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement (as defined
below).

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, each Stockholder is the record and beneficial
owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, except that for
purposes of Schedule A, all options, warrants, restricted stock units and
other similar securities are included even if not exercisable within 60 days
of the date hereof) of the number of (i) shares of Class A Common Stock and
shares of Class B Common Stock (collectively " _Company Common Stock_ "), (ii)
Company Options and (iii) Company RSUs, in each case set forth opposite such
Stockholders name on _Schedule A_ (all such shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Options and Company RSUs set forth on _Schedule A_ next to such
Stockholders name, together with any shares of Company Common Stock that are
hereafter issued to or otherwise directly or indirectly acquired or
beneficially owned by such Stockholder prior to the termination of this
Agreement, including for the avoidance of doubt any shares of Company Common
Stock acquired or otherwise beneficially owned by such Stockholder upon the
exercise of Company Options or vesting of Company RSUs after the date hereof
(collectively " _After-Acquired Shares_ "), but excluding for the avoidance of
doubt any shares of Company Common Stock upon a Permitted Transfer (as
defined below) of such shares, being referred to herein as such Stockholders
" _Subject Shares_ ");

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution hereof, Parent, Purchaser and
MuleSoft, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), are entering into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be
amended from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), which provides, among
other things, for (i) Purchaser to commence the Offer and (ii) following the
consummation of the Offer, the merger of Purchaser with and into the Company,
with the Company being the surviving entity of the merger (the " _Merger_ "),
in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Merger Agreement; and

WHEREAS, as a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, and as an inducement and in consideration for Parent and Purchaser
to enter into the Merger Agreement, each Stockholder, severally and not
jointly, and on such Stockholders own account with respect to such
Stockholders Subject Shares, has agreed to enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
below and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to
be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

 



B-2-1 ARTICLE I

 

AGREEMENT TO TENDER AND VOTE

 

1.1. _Agreement to Tender_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, unless and
until this Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.2,_ each Stockholder agrees to validly and irrevocably
tender or cause to be validly and irrevocably tendered in the Offer all of
such Stockholders Subject Shares (other than (x) Company Options that are
not exercised during the term of this Agreement and (y) Company RSUs that do
not vest during the term of this Agreement) pursuant to and in accordance with
the terms of the Offer, free and clear of all Encumbrances (as defined below)
except for Permitted Encumbrances (as defined below). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, promptly after the Tender Notice (as defined
below), but in no event later than the last time at which the depositary can
accept tenders prior to the expiration of the Offer, each Stockholder shall
validly and irrevocably tender or cause to be validly and irrevocably tendered
in the Offer all of such Stockholders Subject Shares free and clear of all
Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances, including by delivering
pursuant to the terms of the Offer (a) a letter of transmittal with respect to
all of such Stockholders Subject Shares complying with the terms of the
Offer, (b) a certificate representing all such Subject Shares that are
certificated or, in the case of a book-entry share of any uncertificated
Subject Shares, written instructions to such Stockholders broker, dealer or
other nominee that such Subject Shares be tendered, including a reference to
this Agreement, and requesting delivery of an "agents message" (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request)
and (c) all other documents or instruments reasonably required to be
delivered by other Company stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Offer (it
being understood that this sentence shall not apply to (x) Company Options
that are not exercised during the term of this Agreement and (y) Company RSUs
that do not vest during the term of this Agreement). Each Stockholder agrees
that, once any of such Stockholders Subject Shares are tendered, such
Stockholder will not withdraw such Subject Shares from the Offer, unless and
until this Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.2_. In the event this Agreement has been validly terminated
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, __ Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, promptly return to the Stockholder all Subject
Shares such Stockholder tendered in the Offer. At all times commencing with
the date hereof and continuing until the valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, each Stockholder shall not tender any of such
Stockholders Subject Shares into any tender or exchange offer commenced by a
Person other than Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent. For
purposes hereof, a "Tender Notice" means a written notice, delivered by Parent
or Purchaser to each Stockholder on the date of the expiration of the Offer
(as soon as practicable following 1:00 p.m. New York City time on such
expiration date but in no event later than one hour prior to the last time at
which the depositary can accept tenders prior to the expiration), specifying
that (i) all of the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied (or are
reasonably expected to be satisfied as of the expiration of the Offer) or
waived by Purchaser (to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement) (it
being understood that such written notice can only be validly delivered
by Parent or Purchaser to the extent that all of the conditions to the Offer
have, in fact, been satisfied (or are reasonably expected to be satisfied as
of the expiration of the Offer) or otherwise waived by Purchaser (to the
extent permitted by the Merger Agreement)); _provided_ that, for purposes of
the Tender Notice only, the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition shall be
tested assuming that all shares of Company Common Stock to be tendered
pursuant to Section 1.1 of this Agreement are tendered prior to the
expiration of the Offer and that the consummation of the Offer occurs
contemporaneously with the delivery of the Tender Notice. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Section 1.1 shall obligate Parent or Purchaser to
deliver a Tender Notice.

 



B-2-2 1.2. _Agreement to Vote_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each
Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, for so long
as this Agreement has not been validly terminated in accordance with its
terms, if Parent provides at least three (3) business days written notice to
such Stockholder that it has terminated, or elects not to use, the proxy
granted in _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, at any annual or special meeting of the
stockholders of the Company, however called, including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, and in connection with any action proposed to be taken
by written consent of the stockholders of the Company, such Stockholder shall,
in each case, to the fullest extent that such Stockholders Subject Shares are
entitled to vote thereon: (a) appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause
all such Subject Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of
determining a quorum and (b) be present (in person or by proxy) and vote (or
cause to be voted), or deliver (or cause to be delivered) a written consent
with respect to, all of its Subject Shares (i) against any action or agreement
that would reasonably be expected to (A) result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the
Company contained in the Merger Agreement, or of any Stockholder contained in
this Agreement, or (B) result in any of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII or Annex C of the Merger Agreement not being satisfied on or before the
Outside Date; (ii) against any change in the Company Board of Directors that
is not recommended by the Company Board of Directors; and (iii) against any
Acquisition Proposal. Subject to the proxy granted under _Section_ __ _
1.3_ below, each Stockholder shall retain at all times the right to vote such
Stockholders Subject Shares in such Stockholders sole discretion, and
without any other limitation, on any matters other than those expressly set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ that are at any time or from time to time
presented for consideration to the Companys stockholders generally. For the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments in _Sections 1.1_ and _1.2_
 apply to any Subject Shares held by any trust, limited partnership or other
entity directly or indirectly holding Subject Shares over which the applicable
Stockholder exercises direct or indirect voting control.

 

1.3. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Solely with respect to the matters described in
_Section_ __ _ 1.2_, for so long as this Agreement has not been validly
terminated in accordance with its terms, each Stockholder hereby irrevocably
appoints Parent as its attorney and proxy with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, to the full extent of such Stockholders voting rights with
respect to all such Stockholders Subject Shares (which proxy is irrevocable
and which appointment is coupled with an interest, including for purposes of
Section 212 of the DGCL) to vote, and to execute written consents with
respect to, all such Stockholders Subject Shares solely on the matters
described in _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, and in accordance therewith. Each
Stockholder agrees to execute any further agreement or form reasonably
necessary or appropriate to confirm and effectuate the grant of the proxy
contained herein. Such proxy shall automatically terminate upon the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Parent may
terminate this proxy with respect to a Stockholder at any time in its sole
discretion by written notice provided to such Stockholder.

 



B-2-3 1.4. _No Obligation to Exercise_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate any Stockholder to
exercise any option or any other right to acquire any shares of Company Common
Stock.

 

ARTICLE II

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF EACH STOCKHOLDER

 

Each Stockholder represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser, as to such
Stockholder with respect to his, her or its own account and with respect to
its Subject Shares, on a several basis, that:

2.1. _Authorization; Binding Agreement_. If such Stockholder is not an
individual, such Stockholder is duly organized and validly existing in good
standing (where such concept is recognized) under the Laws of the jurisdiction
in which it is incorporated or constituted and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within such Stockholders entity powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary entity actions on the part of
such Stockholder, and such Stockholder has all requisite entity power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. If such Stockholder is an individual,
such Stockholder has all requisite legal capacity, right and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform such Stockholders
obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by such Stockholder and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of such Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder
in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations. If
such Stockholder is married, and any of such Stockholders Subject Shares
constitute community property or otherwise need spousal or other approval for
this Agreement to be legal, valid and binding, this Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by such Stockholders spouse and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Purchaser,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Stockholders
spouse, enforceable against such Stockholders spouse in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations. 

2.2. _Non-Contravention_. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by such Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders spouse) nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby nor compliance by such
Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders spouse) with any provisions
herein will (a) if such Stockholder is not an individual, violate, contravene
or conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws (or other similar governing documents) of such
Stockholder, (b) require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of,
or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity on the part of such
Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders spouse), except for
compliance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or any other United States or federal securities laws and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (c) violate, conflict with, or
result in a breach of any provisions of, or require any consent, waiver or
approval or result in a default or loss of a benefit (or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration or any event
that, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would
constitute a default or give rise to any such right) under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Contract to

 



B-2-4  which such Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders spouse) is a
party or by which such Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders
spouse) or any of such Stockholders Subject Shares may be bound, (d) result
(or, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would
result) in the creation or imposition of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens)
on any asset of such Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders
spouse) (other than one created by Parent or Purchaser) or (e) violate any Law
applicable to such Stockholder (or if applicable, such Stockholders spouse)
or by which any of such Stockholders Subject Shares are bound, except, in
the case of each of clauses (c), (d) and (e), as would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay or impair the consummation by such
Stockholder of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise
materially impair such Stockholders ability to perform its obligations
hereunder.

2.3.  _Ownership of Subject Shares; Total Shares_. Such Stockholder is the
record and beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act,
except that for purposes of Schedule A, all options, warrants, restricted
stock units and other similar securities are included even if not exercisable
within 60 days of the date hereof) of all of such Stockholders Subject Shares
and has good and marketable title to all of such Stockholders Subject Shares
free and clear of any Liens, claims, proxies, voting trusts or agreements,
options, rights, understandings or arrangements or any other encumbrances or
restrictions whatsoever on title, transfer or exercise of any rights of a
stockholder in respect of such Subject Shares (collectively, " _Encumbrances_
"), except for any such Encumbrance that may be imposed pursuant to (i) this
Agreement, (ii) any applicable restrictions on transfer under the Securities
Act or any state securities law, (iii) the Company Governing Documents, (iv)
that certain Sixth Amended and Restated Investors Rights Agreement, dated as
of May 13, 2015 and (v) any applicable Company Equity Plan or agreements
evidencing grants thereunder ((i) through (v), collectively, " _Permitted
Encumbrances_ "). The Subject Shares listed on _Schedule A_ opposite such
Stockholders name constitute all of the shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Options and Company RSUs and any other securities of the Company
beneficially owned by such Stockholder as of the date hereof.

 

2.4. _Voting Power_. Such Stockholder has full voting power with respect to
all such Stockholders Subject Shares (to the extent such Subject Shares have
voting rights), and full power of disposition with respect to such Subject
Shares to the extent they consist of vested shares of Company Common Stock,
full power to issue instructions with respect to the matters set forth herein
and full power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in
each case with respect to all such Stockholders Subject Shares. None of such
Stockholders Subject Shares are subject to any stockholders agreement,
proxy, voting trust or other agreement, arrangement or Encumbrance with
respect to the voting of such Subject Shares, except as expressly provided
herein (including the Permitted Encumbrances).

 

2.5. _Reliance_. Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Parent and
Purchaser are entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such
Stockholders execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement.

2.6. _Absence of Litigation_. With respect to such Stockholder, as of the
date hereof, there is no Proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of
such Stockholder, threatened in writing against such Stockholder or any of
such Stockholders properties or assets 

 



B-2-5  (including any of such Stockholders Subject Shares) before or by any
Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay or impair the consummation by such Stockholder of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially impair such
Stockholders ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

 

2.7. _Brokers_. No broker, finder, financial advisor, investment banker or
other Person is entitled to any brokerage, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission from Parent, Purchaser or the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of such Stockholder. __  

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND PURCHASER

 

Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to each Stockholder that:

 

3.1. _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a duly
organized and validly existing corporation in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Purchaser is owned directly or indirectly by Parent.

 

3.2. _Authority for this Agreement_. Each of Parent and Purchaser has all
requisite entity power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent
and Purchaser have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary entity
action on the part of each of Parent and Purchaser, and no other entity
proceedings on the part of Parent and Purchaser are necessary to authorize
this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Stockholders, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against each
of Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Limitations.

ARTICLE IV

 

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE STOCKHOLDERS

 

Each Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that until the termination of
this Agreement:

 

4.1. _No Transfer; No Inconsistent Arrangements_.

 

(a) Each Stockholder hereby agrees that, from and after the date hereof and
until this Agreement is terminated, such Stockholder shall not, directly or
indirectly, take any action that would have the effect of preventing,
materially delaying or materially impairing such Stockholder from performing
any of its obligations under this Agreement or that would, or would reasonably
be expected to, have the effect of preventing, materially delaying or
materially impairing, the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the performance by the
Company of its obligations under the Merger Agreement.

 



B-2-6 (b) Except as provided hereunder (which, for clarity, includes the tendering
of such Stockholders Subject Shares into the Offer in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement), from and after the date
hereof and until this Agreement is terminated, such Stockholder shall not,
directly or indirectly, (i) create or permit to exist any Encumbrance, other
than Permitted Encumbrances, on any of such Stockholders Subject Shares, (ii)
transfer, sell, assign, gift, hedge, distribute, pledge or otherwise dispose
of (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by depositing, submitting or
otherwise tendering any such Subject Shares into any tender or exchange offer
other than the Offer and, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
"Transfer" (for this purpose, as defined in the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Charter_ ")) or other
action that would cause or result in the conversion of a share of Class B
Common Stock into a share of Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section
IV.D.3(a), (b) or (d) or (e) of the Charter), or enter into any derivative
arrangement with respect to (collectively, " _Transfer_ "), any of such
Stockholders Subject Shares, or any right or interest therein (or consent to
any of the foregoing), (iii) enter into any Contract with respect to any
Transfer of such Stockholders Subject Shares or any legal or beneficial
interest therein, (iv) grant or permit the grant of any proxy, power-of-
attorney or other authorization or consent in or with respect to any such
Stockholders Subject Shares or (v) deposit or permit the deposit of any of
such Stockholders Subject Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting
agreement or arrangement with respect to any of such Stockholders Subject
Shares. Any action taken in violation of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be null and void _ab initio_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) any
Stockholder may Transfer such Stockholders Subject Shares to a Permitted
Transferee (as defined in the Charter), but solely if and to the extent that
such Transfer would not result in the conversion under the Charter of such
Subject Shares that are shares of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common
Stock, and (B) any Stockholder may Transfer not more than 750,000 of such
Stockholders Subject Shares in one or more charitable contributions, but
solely if and to the extent that such Transfer occurs not more than 10
business days prior to the initial expiration of the Offer (any such Transfer
described in clauses (A) or (B) above and any Transfer as Parent may agree
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(d)_ below, a " _Permitted Transfer_ "),
_provided_ , that a Transfer described in this sentence shall be a Permitted
Transfer only if (x) all of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement with respect to such Stockholder would be true and correct upon such
Transfer and (y) the transferee of such Subject Shares, prior to the date of
such Transfer, agrees in a signed writing satisfactory to Parent (acting
reasonably) to accept such Subject Shares subject to the terms of this
Agreement and to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as a "Stockholder"
for all purposes of this Agreement. If any involuntary Transfer of any of
such Stockholders Subject Shares in the Company shall occur (including, but
not limited to, a sale by such Stockholders trustee in any bankruptcy, or a
sale to a purchaser at any creditors or court sale), the transferee (which
term, as used herein, shall include any and all transferees and subsequent
transferees of the initial transferee) shall, subject to applicable Law, take
and hold such Subject Shares subject to all of the restrictions,
obligations, liabilities and rights under this Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect until valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

 

(c) Unless and until this Agreement shall have been validly terminated in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.2, _such Stockholder agrees that it shall
not, and shall cause each of its controlled affiliates not to, become a member
of a "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) for the
purpose of opposing or competing with or taking any actions inconsistent with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 4.1(b)_, such Stockholder may make
Transfers of such Stockholders Subject Shares as Parent may agree in writing
in its sole discretion.

 



B-2-7 4.2. _No Exercise of Appraisal Rights_. Such Stockholder forever and
irrevocably waives and agrees not to exercise any appraisal rights or
dissenters rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or otherwise in respect
of such Stockholders Subject Shares that may arise in connection with the
Offer or the Merger. 

4.3. _Documentation and Information_. Such Stockholder shall not make any
public announcement regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by
applicable Law (provided that reasonable notice of any such disclosure will
be provided to Parent, and such Stockholder will consider in good faith the
reasonable comments of Parent with respect to such disclosure and otherwise
cooperate with Parent in obtaining confidential treatment with respect to such
disclosure). Such Stockholder consents to and hereby authorizes Parent and
Purchaser to publish and disclose in all documents and schedules filed with
the SEC or any other Governmental Entity or applicable securities exchange,
and any press release or other disclosure document that Parent or Purchaser
reasonably determines to be necessary or advisable in connection with the
Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or this Agreement, such Stockholders identity and ownership of
such Stockholders Subject Shares, the existence of this Agreement and the
nature of such Stockholders commitments and obligations under this Agreement,
and such Stockholder acknowledges that Parent and Purchaser may, in Parents
sole discretion, file this Agreement or a form hereof with the SEC or any
other Governmental Entity or securities exchange. Such Stockholder agrees to
promptly give Parent any information it may reasonably require for
the preparation of any such disclosure documents, and such Stockholder agrees
to promptly notify Parent of any required corrections with respect to any
information supplied by such Stockholder specifically for use in any such
disclosure document, if and to the extent that any such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect.

4.4. _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, stock dividend, merger,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or the like of the capital stock of the Company affecting a
Stockholders Subject Shares, the terms of this Agreement shall apply to the
resulting securities.

4.5. _Waiver of Certain Actions_. Each Stockholder hereby agrees not to
commence or participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of
any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or
otherwise, against Parent, Purchaser, the Company, any of their respective
affiliates or successors or any of their respective directors, managers or
officers (a) challenging the validity of, or seeking to enjoin or delay the
operation of, any provision of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement
(including any claim seeking to enjoin or delay the consummation of the Offer
or the closing of the Merger) or (b) alleging a breach of any duty of the
Company Board of Directors in connection with the Merger Agreement, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or hereby.

 



B-2-8 4.6. _No Solicitation_. Unless and until this Agreement shall have been
validly terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.2 _, each Stockholder
shall not, and shall cause its controlled affiliates not to, and shall cause
its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiry, proposal
or offer, or the making, submission or announcement of any inquiry, proposal
or offer which constitute or would be reasonably expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or

amended or waived if such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in
the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a
waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure

assignment by Parent or Purchaser; _provided_ , that Parent or Purchaser may

and Purchaser shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon Parent and Purchaser will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon Parent or
Purchaser, and the exercise by Parent or Purchaser of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



B-2-10 5.7. _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds
it lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to
commence any such action or proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks
jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such
court finds it lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such action or proceeding in such courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in such courts. Each Stockholder
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Each
Stockholder irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section_ __ _
5.7(a)_ in the manner provided for notices in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of Parent or Purchaser to
serve process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law.

(b) EACH STOCKHOLDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT
IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH STOCKHOLDER CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF PARENT OR PURCHASER HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
5.7(b)_.

5.8. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law
of any other state.

 

5.9. _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or to affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



B-2-11 5.10. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

5.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner.

 

5.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which, taken together,
shall constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement or any counterpart
may be executed and delivered by facsimile copies or delivered by electronic
communications by portable document format (.pdf), each of which shall be
deemed an original.

5.13. _Interpretation_. The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "herewith"
and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, and article, section, paragraph and schedule references are to the
articles, sections, paragraphs and schedules of this Agreement unless

in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Person by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

5.14. _Further Assurances_. Each Stockholder will execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all further documents and instruments and
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law, to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

5.15. _Capacity as Stockholder_. Each Stockholder signs this Agreement in such
Stockholders capacity as a stockholder of the Company, and not, if

of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement shall in any way restrict a director or officer of the Company

each Stockholder hereunder shall be several and not joint, and no Stockholder
shall be liable for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any other
Stockholder.

unless and until (i) the Merger Agreement is executed and delivered by all
parties thereto and (ii) this Agreement is executed by all parties hereto.

shall be the subject of any stop order or proceeding seeking a stop order;

(E) the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Offer and the

_Section 7.12_); or

(F) any of the following shall have occurred and continue to exist as
of immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer:

(1) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in

warranties of the Company set forth in  _Section 4.2(a)_, _Section 4.2(c)_,
_Section 4.2(d)_ or _Section 4.2(e)_ shall not be true and correct other
than for _de minimis_ inaccuracies as of the date hereof or shall not be true

another date, in which case as of such date); (C) the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 4.8(a)_ shall not be true and
correct in all respects; or (D) the other representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement (without giving effect to any
qualification as to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect contained
therein) shall not be true and correct as of the date hereof or shall not be
true and correct as of the expiration of the Offer as though made on and as
of the expiration of the Offer (except representations and warranties that by
their terms speak specifically as of another date, in which case as of such
date), except, with respect to this clause (D), where any failures of
any such representations and warranties to be true and correct (without
giving effect to any qualification as to materiality or Company Material
Adverse Effect contained therein) have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect;

(2) the Company shall not have performed or complied in all material respects
with the obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed or
complied with by it under the Agreement at or prior to the expiration of the

have not occurred; or

 

(5) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

Except as expressly set forth in the Agreement, the foregoing conditions are
for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser, may be asserted by Parent
or Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such
conditions, and may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time in their sole and absolute discretion (except
for the Minimum Condition), in each case, subject to the terms of the
Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by
Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall
not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed
an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
