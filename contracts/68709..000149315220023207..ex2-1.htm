ARTICLE I

  

THE MERGER

  



  

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the MBCA, at the Effective Time, Sub
will be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent.

  



  

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place on the third (3rd) Business Day following the date on which each
of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ is satisfied, or to the extent
permitted by Law, waived by the party entitled to waive such condition (other
than those conditions that by their terms are only capable of being satisfied
on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible,
waiver of such conditions by the party entitled to waive such conditions) by
the exchange of electronic signatures and documents, at the offices of Sidley
Austin LLP, One South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603, or at another
time, date or place agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

  



  

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Closing, the Company
shall file articles of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Articles of
Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the MBCA, and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the
MBCA (if any). The Merger shall become effective on the date and time at which
the Articles of Merger have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Minnesota or at such later date and time as is agreed between
the parties and specified in the Articles of Merger (such date and time, the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.04 _Organizational Documents, Directors and Officers of the
Surviving Corporation_.

  



  

(a)  _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, (i) subject to
_Section 5.10_ , the Company Charter, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, will by virtue of the Merger be amended and restated so as to
read in its entirety in the form set forth in _Exhibit B_ , and as so amended
and restated, shall be the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
Law and the applicable provisions of the amended and restated articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the Company Bylaws shall
be amended and restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and
restated, shall thereafter be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except
that references to the name of Sub shall be replaced by references to the
name of the Surviving Corporation), in each case, until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the articles
of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b)  _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all requisite action so that
the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time
shall consist of the members of the board of directors of Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office until such member's
respective successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified or until such
member's earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c)  _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all requisite action so that
the officers of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the

successor is duly appointed and qualified or until such officer's earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE II

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  



  

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of
the Company or Sub:

  



  

(i)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, shall
automatically be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive
$58.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and all of
such Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and each certificate representing a Share (a " _Certificate_ ") or
non-certificated Share represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
that formerly represented any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
shall thereafter be cancelled and cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, subject to _Section 2.05_.

  



  

(ii)  _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any
Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent, Sub or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (other than, in each case, Shares held on
behalf of a third party) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no
payment being made with respect thereto.

  



  

(iii)  _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock of Sub, par value $0.25 per share, shall be automatically converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.25 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, all certificates representing common stock of Sub shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(b)  _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class (including by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date and payment date within such period), the
Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change so as
to provide Parent and the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _that_
nothing in this _Section 2.01(b)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize the
Company to effect any such change that it is prohibited from undertaking
pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

  



  

(a)  _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
U.S.-based nationally recognized financial institution reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the
holders of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders
shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal to the sum of the
Aggregate Common Stock Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Fund shall be held in trust by the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
holders of Shares that are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. In
the event the Exchange Fund is insufficient to make the payments contemplated
by this _ARTICLE II_ , Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount in cash such that the Exchange Fund becomes sufficient to
make such payments. Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall, if Parent
so elects, be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P1
or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the
holders of Shares pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ ; _provided _ that no
investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by
this _ARTICLE II_ , and following any losses from any such investment, Parent
shall promptly deposit with the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, an amount in cash
equal to the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be held and
disbursed in the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying
Agent to make the payments contemplated by this _ARTICLE II_. Any interest or
income produced by such investments will be payable to Sub or Parent, as
Parent directs. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to hold the
Exchange Fund for the benefit of the persons entitled to Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Section 2.01_ and to make payments from the Exchange Fund
in accordance with this _Section 2.02_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to this _Section 2.02_ ,
except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  _Procedures for Surrender_.

  



  

(i)  _Certificated Shares_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time (but in no event later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to
the Effective Time), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section 2.02(e)_ ) to the Paying Agent; and (B) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of any Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_ ) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, if applicable, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal,
duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates and such
other documents as may be customarily required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant
to _Section 2.01_ , and the Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and
Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is
properly endorsed or is otherwise in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment either pays to the Paying Agent any transfer and
other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
so surrendered or establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.

  



  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii)  _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each
registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon
the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than two (2)
Business Days thereafter), the Merger Consideration for each Book-Entry Share.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered.

  



  

(iii)  _No Interest_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of
the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_ ) or in
respect of any Book-Entry Share.

  



  

(c)  _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _ARTICLE II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, subject, however,
to _Section 2.05_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing Shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_ ) are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with
respect thereto) not disbursed to or claimed by holders of Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of their Shares in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section 2.02(b)_ , without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Share for Merger Consideration properly delivered to a
Governmental Entity in accordance with any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been
surrendered immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent or Sub,
as Parent directs, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(e)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent) of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration
into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were converted
pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_.

  



  

Section 2.03 _Treatment of Company Options, RSU Awards, ESPP and Equity
Plans_.

  



  

(a)  _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions
that provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon
the Merger, each outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under a
Company Stock Plan (other than any option granted under the Company Stock
Purchase Plan) (the " _Company Options_ ") shall be fully vested and
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled
Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in
cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares
subject to such cancelled Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Share
subject to such cancelled Company Option, without interest (such amounts
payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that
(1) any such Company Option with respect to which the exercise price per Share
subject thereto is equal or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (2) such Option Payments shall
be reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.05_. From and after the Effective Time, no Company Option shall be
outstanding or exercisable, and each Company Option shall entitle the holder
thereof only to the payment provided for in this _Section 2.03(a)_.

  



  

   

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b)  _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_.

  



  

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions that provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the Merger, (A) each
outstanding award of restricted stock units with respect to Shares
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, each such restricted stock unit that
is subject to a deferral election) (each, an " _RSU Award_ ") granted
pursuant to a Company Stock Plan shall be fully vested; _provided_ , _however_
, that each RSU Award that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions
shall be deemed to be vested at the greater of (1) actual performance
determined as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) target level
and (B) each RSU Award shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each
holder of any such cancelled RSU Award shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such RSU Award and in settlement
therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (1)
the number of vested restricted stock units subject to such RSU Award,
multiplied by (2) the Merger Consideration, without interest (such amounts
payable hereunder, the " _RSU Payments_ ") (less any required Tax withholdings
as provided in _Section 2.05_ ).

  



  

(c)  _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions that provide that, as of the Effective Time, all Company Stock
Plans shall terminate, and no further rights with respect to Shares or any
other awards shall be granted thereunder.

  



  

(d)  _Treatment of Company Stock Purchase Plan_. The provisions of _Section
2.03(a)_ shall not apply to any rights under the Company Stock Purchase Plan.
With respect to the Company Stock Purchase Plan, as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) shall adopt resolutions or take other actions as may be required
to provide that no further "Phases" (as defined in the Company Stock Purchase
Plan) will commence pursuant to the Company Stock Purchase Plan after the
date hereof and that any money withheld from a participant's pay pursuant to
the Company Stock Purchase Plan that has not been used to purchase Shares at

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held of record or beneficially by a person who has not
voted in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and who is entitled
to demand and properly exercises dissenters' rights with respect to such
Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (the " _Dissenters Rights_
"), shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration for such Dissenting Shares but instead shall be entitled to
payment of the fair value (including interest determined in accordance with
Section 302A.473 of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the Dissenters Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
dissent under the Dissenters Rights, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease and such
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive,
the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall provide
prompt written notice to Parent of any demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the
Company for Dissenters Rights with respect to any Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings

Section 2.05 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent (and their respective affiliates) (each, a " _Payor_ ")
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts payable in
connection with this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, any
regulation promulgated thereunder by the United States Department of Treasury
(a " _Treasury Regulation_ ") or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law; _provided_ , _however,_ that under no circumstance will a Payor
deduct or withhold any amount under Section 1445 of the Code so long as the
Company provides the certification and notice described in _Section 5.13_.
After the date of this Agreement, the Company will (and will cause the
Company Subsidiaries to) reasonably cooperate with any reasonable request of
Parent in connection with determining whether any withholding Taxes are
applicable to payments made in connection with this Agreement. In the event
that Parent determines that any such withholding Taxes are applicable, (i)
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Company prior
to the date on which such withholding is anticipated to occur, (ii) Parent and
the Company shall reasonably cooperate to minimize or eliminate such
withholding Taxes as permitted by applicable Law and (iii) without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Parent to minimize any such withholding Taxes in accordance with
applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted by a
Payor, such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by such Payor to the
applicable Governmental Entity and (b) to the extent so remitted shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by such
Payor.

_Section 5.03(a)_ and is not withdrawn, make a Change of Company
Recommendation (and, if so desired by the Company Board (or any
duly authorized committee thereof) terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 7.01(d)_ in order to cause the Company to enter into a binding
and definitive written Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a

Proposal;

Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall direct its
applicable Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith during the
four (4) Business Days commencing on the date of delivery of the Notice of

after the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation, the Company
Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel and after considering any proposed amendments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing during such four
(4) Business Day period, that (A) failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (B) such Competing Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _that_ any change to the financial terms
(including any change to the amount or form of consideration payable) or
other material amendment to the terms of such Competing Proposal (whether or

thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a Change of Company
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, _provided_ , _that_ , in each case
only if:

  



  

(i) the Company has first given Parent advance written notice at least four
(4) Business Days prior to taking such action of its intention to take such
action, including a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event
(it being agreed that the delivery of such notice and the public announcement
of such delivery shall not constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

  



  

(ii) if requested by Parent, prior to effecting such Change of Company
Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall direct its
applicable Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith during the
four (4) Business Days commencing on the date of delivery of such notice
regarding any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in writing;

  



  

(iii) following the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company
Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and after
considering any proposed amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in writing during such four (4) Business Day
period, the failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

hereof). Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the
Proxy Statement, and each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning it and its affiliates (including, in the case of
Parent, Sub) and any transaction any of them have or are contemplating
entering into in connection with this Agreement that is necessary or
appropriate in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and
provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in the
connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy
Statement. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (including any preliminary Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto) or any other documents related to the
Company Shareholders Meeting, or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement (and any
amendment or supplement thereto), any other documents related to the Company
Shareholders Meeting or response (including the proposed final version of the
Proxy Statement or response) and (ii) shall consider in good faith all
comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent upon the receipt of any comments (written or oral) from the SEC or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or

correspondence between the Company or its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, related to the Proxy Statement or
the Transactions.

  



  

(b) If, at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, Sub, any of their affiliates
or any transaction any of them have or are contemplating entering into in
connection with this Agreement, is discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that such document shall not contain any untrue statement of any material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, at the time and in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not false or
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall as promptly as
practicable notify the other party and correct such information, and the
Company shall file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information as promptly as reasonably practicable after
Parent has had a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to
the extent the Company determines it is required by applicable Law, the
Company shall disseminate such amendment or supplement to the shareholders of
the Company.

all action necessary to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as
practicable after the SEC Clearance Date, for the purpose of seeking the
Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall consult with Parent regarding
the date to be used as the record date and the timing of any "broker search"
required under Rule 14a-13 of the Exchange Act. Without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Company Shareholder Approval shall be the only
matter (other than procedure matters and executive compensation matters
related to the Transactions) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by
Company shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting. In connection with
the foregoing, the Company shall (i) file the definitive Proxy Statement with
the SEC and cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company's shareholders as of the record date established for the
Company Shareholders Meeting as promptly as practicable (and shall use
reasonable best efforts to do so within five (5) Business Days) after the
date on which the Company is informed that the SEC has no further comments on
the Proxy Statement (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ "; _provided that_ if the SEC
has failed to affirmatively notify the Company within ten (10) calendar days
after the initial filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC that it will or
will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, then such date shall be the " _SEC
Clearance Date_ "); and (ii) unless the Company Board has made a Change of
Company Recommendation in accordance with _Section 5.04_ , use reasonable
best efforts to solicit the Company Shareholder Approval. The Company shall,
through the Company Board, make and include the Company Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, subject to _Section 5.04_. Unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall (A) provide Parent
reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on
a timely basis and (B) give written notice to Parent one day prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting, and on the day of, but prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting, indicating whether as of such date sufficient proxies
representing the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained.

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) in the event of _clause (iii)_
: (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to
allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the Company has determined in good faith is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Company's shareholders prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting or following an order or request from the SEC, (iv) to
allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval or (v) to the extent the Company is obligated to do so
under applicable Law;  _provided_ , _that_ , except as required by Law _,_

postponed in accordance with the foregoing on more than two (2) separate
occasions and shall not be recessed, adjourned or postponed by more than ten
(10) Business Days on any such occasion without the prior written consent of
Parent; _provided further _ that, except as required by Law, in no case shall
the Company Shareholders Meeting be recessed, adjourned or postponed to a
date on or after the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding the Outside Date. In
the event that the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting as originally
called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the
Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing,
it shall use reasonable best efforts to implement such adjournment or
postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish
a new record date for the Company Shareholders Meeting, as so
adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by applicable Law. Unless
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE VII_ prior
to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall submit this Agreement
and the Merger to its shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting, even
if the Company Board has effected a Change of Company Recommendation.

Section 5.06 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement until
the earlier to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _ARTICLE_ VII and the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
each Company Subsidiary to: (a) provide to Parent and Sub and their
respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours in
such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of any
business conducted by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to the books and
records (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, and upon agreement of the Company (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld) to the officers, employees,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, and (b) furnish promptly such information concerning the
business, properties, Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request,
in each case to facilitate the consummation of the Transactions and the
integration of the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall
not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such access
or furnish such information to the extent that the Company believes in good
faith that doing so would: (i) result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege); (ii) violate any
confidentiality obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
third party or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party ( _provided_
that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure); (iii)
result in a competitor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary receiving
information that is competitively sensitive; (iv) breach, contravene or
violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Law); or (v) in the case of physical access to the properties and personnel by
any person, jeopardize the health and safety of any employee of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries, in light of COVID-19 or any COVID-19 Measures (
_provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that does not jeopardize such health
and safety). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from the date of
this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE_ VII and the Effective Time, Parent and
Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives acting on
their behalf not to, contact any customer, partner, vendor, supplier or
employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case
outside of the ordinary course of business and in connection with the
Transactions without the Company's prior written consent. All requests
for information made pursuant to this _Section 5.06_ shall be directed the
person or persons designated by the Company. Parent shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to, hold
all information provided or furnished pursuant to this _Section 5.06_
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. During any visit to the business or property sites of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub shall, and shall
cause their respective representatives accessing such properties to, comply
with all applicable Laws and all of the Company's and the Company
Subsidiaries' safety and security procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 5.06_ , from the date of this Agreement
until the earlier to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _ARTICLE VII_ and the Effective Time, none of Parent, Sub or
any of their respective affiliates shall conduct, without the prior written
consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), any environmental investigation at any real property
owned or leased by the Company, and in no event may any
environmental investigation include any sampling or other intrusive
investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or anything else at or
in connection with any of such real property.

(b) In furtherance of the obligations set forth in _Section 5.07(a_ ) and
notwithstanding any limitations therein or elsewhere in this Agreement,
Parent shall, as promptly as possible, take (and shall cause each of its
affiliates to take as promptly as possible) any and all actions necessary or
advisable in order to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment to the
consummation of the Transactions under any Antitrust Laws or foreign
investment Laws and obtain all approvals and consents, including
approvals and consents under any Antitrust Laws or foreign investment Laws
that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local

operational restrictions or limitations on, and committing to or effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, the sale, license,
disposition or holding separate of, such assets or businesses of Parent, Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates

or advisable to obtain such approvals or consents of such Governmental
Entities under any Antitrust Laws or foreign investment Laws or to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Orders
pursuant to any Antitrust Laws or foreign investment Laws that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
and its affiliates shall not be required to (and the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and their affiliates (x) shall not, without Parent's prior
written consent and (y) shall, if Parent requests in writing) take any action
or enter into any agreement described in this _Section 5.07(b)_ if taking
such action or entering into such agreement would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a material and adverse impact on
(A) the sensors business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole (the " _Company Sensors Business_ "), (B) the sensors business of
Parent and its affiliates, taken as a whole, but deemed for this purpose to
be the same size as the Company Sensors Business or (C) the sensors businesses
of Parent and its affiliates, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, but deemed for this purpose to be the same size as the Company
Sensors Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Antitrust
Laws, Parent and its affiliates shall only be required to take any actions or
enter into any agreements described in this _clause (b)_ if they relate to the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Parent Competing Business. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Competing Business_ " means any
business or operations of Parent or any affiliate of Parent that (i) compete
with, or have the capability to compete with, the Company or (ii) designs,
manufactures, distributes, sells, provides or has any product or service that
competes with (or has the capability to compete with) or are substitutes for
any product or service that the Company or any Company Subsidiary designs,
manufactures, distributes, sells, provides or otherwise has.

  



  

(c) Neither Parent nor Sub, directly or indirectly, through one or more of
their respective affiliates or otherwise, shall take any action, including
acquiring or making any investment in any person or any division or assets
thereof, if such acquisition or investment would reasonably be expected to
prevent or cause a material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in _ARTICLE VI_ or the consummation of the Merger.

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.07_ , each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
the making, commencement or receipt of any document or information request,
inquiry, investigation, or Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties promptly
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, or
Proceeding; (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to
or from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity
regarding the Transactions and (iv) provide the other parties with copies of
all written communications to or from any Governmental Entity regarding the
Transactions. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other
parties and, prior to making or submitting any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or other written or oral
submission or communication to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions, give the other parties a reasonable advance opportunity to
review and comment upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other
with respect to, such submission or communication; _provided that_ , without
limiting Parent's obligations under this _Section 5.07_ , Parent shall
control the strategy and course of action, and make all final
determinations, for obtaining all consents, approvals or waivers that may be
sought from any Governmental Entity pursuant to this _Section 5.07_ ,
including but not limited to the timing of filings and all actions and
decisions regarding any Proceedings or other actions challenging the
consummation of the Transactions. In addition, except as may be prohibited by
any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding, each party hereto will give the
other parties reasonable advance notice of any meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions and permit the other
parties to be present and participate at each meeting or conference relating
to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding, it being
understood that Parent shall lead and direct any such meeting or conference
and shall have final decision making authority with respect to the strategy
for and contents of such meeting or conference. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this _Section 5.07_ , no party hereto shall be in violation of
this Agreement by virtue of providing information that is competitively
sensitive to one another on an "outside counsel only" basis to ensure
compliance with applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust
Law).

  



  

Section 5.08 _Defense of Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise
Parent of any Proceeding (including any putative class action or derivative
litigation) asserted, threatened in writing or commenced by, on behalf of or
in the name of, against or otherwise involving the Company, the Company
Board, any committee thereof or any of the Company's directors or officers
relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of Transactions (any such
Proceeding, a " _Transaction Litigation_ ") and shall keep Parent informed on
a reasonably prompt basis regarding any such Transaction Litigation. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to (a) participate in the defense,
prosecution, settlement or compromise of any Transaction Litigation, and (b)
consult with counsel to the Company regarding the defense, prosecution,
settlement or compromise with respect to any such Transaction Litigation. For
purposes of this _Section 5.08_ , "participate" means that Parent will be kept
reasonably apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with
respect to the Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the attorney-client
privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise
adversely affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with
respect to such Transaction Litigation which the Company shall consider in
good faith; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not settle or
compromise or agree to settle or compromise any Transaction Litigation
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 5.09 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release issued by
Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement and the Transactions shall
be a joint press release, the contents of which have received prior approval
from both such parties, and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation; _provided_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section
5.09_ shall not apply to any press release, public statement or other
announcement issued or made, or proposed to be issued or made, by either
Parent or the Company (a) in connection with, or in response to, a Competing
Proposal or Change of Company Recommendation in compliance with  _Section
5.03_ and _Section 5.04_ with respect to the matters contemplated thereby, or
(b) as may be required by applicable Law, the fiduciary duties of the Company
Board or any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or (c)
that is consistent in all material respects with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made by a party hereto in accordance
with this _Section 5.09_ , including investor conference calls, filings with
the SEC, QandAs or other publicly disclosed documents, in each case under this
_clause (c)_ to the extent such disclosure is still accurate. Nothing in this
_Section 5.09_ shall limit the ability of the Company to make any internal
announcements to its employees that are consistent in all material respects
with the prior public disclosures regarding the Transactions or not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company
concurrently provide a copy to Parent of any such communication. For the
avoidance of doubt, any public filings providing notice to or seeking approval
from any Governmental Entity made pursuant to _Section 5.09_ shall be
governed by _Section 5.07_ and not this _Section 5.09_.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a)  _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each current or former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and each fiduciary under benefit
plans of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the
proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising
out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the
extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or
was a director, officer, or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ ") and (ii) all Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the
Transactions, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing such person's rights
under this _Section 5.10_. In the event of any such Indemnified Liability
(whether or not asserted before the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by
the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred in each case to the extent provided
in the Company Charter, Company Bylaws and any indemnification agreements of
the Company (that have been made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof) in effect on the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that the person
to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if
it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to
indemnification under Law).

  



    

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(b)  _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective
Time, and if the Company fails to do so, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the
premium for an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage
for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is
substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate to the intended beneficiaries thereof than the Company's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy; _provided_ , that in no
event shall the premium of the DandO Insurance exceed 300% of the then current
aggregate annual premium of the Company's existing policy in place at the
Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such
six (6) year period thereunder are being adjudicated) the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6) year period (and for so
long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six (6) year
period thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such
case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, require
such successors, assigns or transferees of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent to assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

  



  

(d)  _Continuation_. For not less than six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation and the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
documents) of each Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set
forth in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the
equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary. The
contractual indemnification rights, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that have been made available to Parent prior to the
date hereof shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further
action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms following the Effective Time.

  



  

(e)  _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, each
Indemnified Party's heirs, executors or administrators and each Indemnified
Party's representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended in
a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Parties (including their
successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified Party
(including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

  



    

 | 48| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(f)  _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise. Nothing
in this Agreement, including this _Section 5.10_ , is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this  _Section 5.10_ is not prior to, or in substitution for,
any such claims under any such policies.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use all reasonable
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the Merger or the other
Transactions and (b) if any Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
restrict or prohibit any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so
that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize (to the greatest extent practicable) the effects of such
Takeover Statute on such Transactions.

  



  

Section 5.12 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Closing Date
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, provide each individual
who is an employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary
or base wage rate, as applicable, that is no less than the base salary or base
wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) incentive
compensation opportunities that are no less than the incentive compensation
opportunities (including the value of cash incentive opportunities, but
excluding equity and equity-based incentive opportunities) as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing, (iii) severance payments and
benefits that are no less and on no less favorable terms than the severance
payments and benefits set forth in _Section 5.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter and (iv) employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are substantially
similar to the employee benefits (other than severance and cash, equity and
equity-based incentive compensation opportunities) provided immediately prior
to the Closing. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall
be obligated to continue to employ any Company Employee for any specific
period of time following the Closing Date, subject to applicable Law.

  



  

(b) For a period of two years following the Closing Date (or such longer
period as required by the terms of MTS Systems Corporation Change in Control
Severance Plan, as amended and restated), Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and
continue the MTS Systems Corporation Change in Control Severance Plan, as
amended and restated.

  



  

(c) To the extent that service is relevant for any purpose including
eligibility, benefit accrual and vesting (including, in order to calculate
the amount of any paid time off and leave balance (including vacation and sick
days)), gratuities, severance and similar benefits (except, unless required
by applicable Law, not for purposes of defined benefit pension benefit
accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established
or maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) for the benefit of the Company Employees (the " _Parent Plans_ ")
following the Closing Date, such plan, program or arrangement shall credit
such Company Employees for service earned on and prior to the Closing
Date with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their
predecessors in addition to service earned with Parent or any of Parent's
affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

(d) On the Closing Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter (and no later
than the second regularly scheduled pay day following the Closing Date),
Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to, make pro-rated payments under the MTS Executive Variable
Compensation (EVC) Plan to eligible Company Employees in respect of the
performance period in effect as of the Closing Date based on the number of
days in such performance period that elapsed prior to the Closing Date
by 365; _provided that_ the applicable performance goals shall be deemed
attained at the threshold level. With respect to bonus periods under any
other Company Benefit Plans and any other incentive or bonus plan, the cost of
which is included in the annual operating plan budget for the applicable
business units, for which the performance period has ended and bonuses have
been earned (notwithstanding any continuing employment obligation) but have
not been paid as of Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to, make such bonus payments to Company
Employees on the Closing Date, or as soon as possible thereafter (and no
later than the second regularly scheduled pay day following the Closing Date).

  



  

(e) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to, waive any waiting periods and
actively at work or evidence of insurability requirements and any limitations
on eligibility, enrollment and benefits relating to any preexisting
conditions of Company Employees and their eligible dependents under each
Parent Plan. Following the Closing Date, Parent shall recognize, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to also
recognize, for purposes of annual deductible and out of pocket limits under
its Parent Plans providing health benefits, any deductible,
coinsurance, copayments and out of pocket expenses paid by such Company
Employees and their respective dependents under Company Benefit Plans in the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs to the extent such Company
Employees participate in any such Parent Plans in such same plan year.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as the establishment or amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or any
other employee benefit plan maintained by the Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates or create any rights or obligations except between the
parties hereto, (ii) give any employee or former employee or any other
individual associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee
thereof or any other third person any right to enforce the provisions of this
_Section 5.12_ or entitle any person not a party to this Agreement to assert
any claim hereunder or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their affiliates to (A) except as set forth in _Section 5.12(b)_ ,
maintain any particular benefit plan, except in accordance with the terms of
such plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

deliver a certification, in form and substance required by the Treasury
Regulations under Section 1445(b)(3) of the Code and reasonably acceptable to

within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, together with a duly
executed notice of such certification to the IRS.

Transactions shall be paid when due by Parent, Sub or, after the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 5.15 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
actions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that the
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act pursuant to the Transactions are exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

7.01_ (other than pursuant to _Section 7.01(a)_ ) shall give written notice

Section 7.02 _Effect of Termination_.

  



  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in _Section 7.01_ , this Agreement shall immediately
become void and of no effect with no liability or obligation to any person on
the part of any party hereto or their respective affiliates; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) no termination shall relieve any party hereto of its
obligations under the penultimate sentence of _Section 5.06_ (Access to
Information), _Section 5.09_ (Public Announcements),  _Section 5.14_
(Expenses), this _Section 7.02_ (Effect of Termination), _Section 7.03_
(Amendment),  _Section 7.04_ (Waiver) and _ARTICLE VIII,_ each of which shall
survive any termination and (ii) the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; _provided further_ ,
that no such termination shall relieve any party from any liability for
common law fraud or Intentional Breach of this Agreement prior to the date of
termination, in which case the non-breaching party shall be entitled to all
rights and remedies available at law or in equity, including to recover any
damages (including Derivative Damages), costs, expenses, liabilities of any
kind, in each case, suffered by the party as a result of such breach ("
_Damages_ "). It shall be deemed to be an Intentional Breach of this Agreement
by a party if such party does not consummate the Closing at the time the
Closing is required to be consummated pursuant to _Section 1.02_.

  



  

(b)  _Company Payments_.

  



  

(i) If this Agreement is validly terminated (A) by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(ii)_ (Company Shareholder Approval), (B)
by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ (Outside
Date) or (C) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(e)_ (Company Breach) and,
(1) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, a Competing
Proposal was publicly disclosed and not withdrawn, expired or rejected prior
to the Company Shareholders Meeting and not withdrawn, expired or rejected
prior to the valid termination of this Agreement (or, in connection with the
foregoing _clauses (B)_ or _(C)_ , otherwise made known to the Company), and
(2) at any time within twelve (12) months after such termination, the Company
(x) enters into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement to effect any
Competing Proposal or (y) consummates a Competing Proposal, then the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent or its designee prior to or
concurrently with the consummation of such Competing Proposal or the entry
into such definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement, if earlier. For
purposes of this _Section 7.02(b)(i)_ , all references to "twenty percent
(20%)" and "eighty percent (80%)" in the definition of Competing Proposal
will be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)."

  



    

 | 55| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.01(c)_ (Change of Company Recommendation), then the Company shall pay the
Company Termination Fee to Parent or its designee no later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination.

_Section 7.01(d)_ (Superior Proposal), then the Company shall pay the Company
Termination Fee to Parent or its designee prior to or concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(iv) If this Agreement is validly terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(ii)_ (Company Shareholder Approval), and at the
time of such termination, Parent had the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.01(c) _ (Change of Company Recommendation), then the
Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent or its designee no
later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination.

  



  

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the Transactions and
(ii) without these agreements, Parent, Sub and the Company would not enter
into this Agreement.

  



  

(d) In no event shall the Company be required to pay to Parent more than one
Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.02(b)_. Except as provided in
_Section 7.02(a)_ , in the event that Parent receives full payment of the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.02(b)_ under circumstances
where a Company Termination Fee was payable, the receipt of the
Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for
any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Sub, any of
their respective affiliates or any other person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Merger and the other Transactions
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination; _provided that_ no such payment shall relieve any party of any
liability or damages to any other party resulting from any common law fraud
or Intentional Breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in
this _Section 7.02_ shall be deemed to affect their respective rights to
specific performance under _Section 8.10_ in order to specifically enforce
this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that any payment of the
Company Termination Fee, is not a penalty but is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that is intended to compensate Parent or Sub in the
circumstances in which such fees are payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of an Intentional
Breach by the Company, Parent or Sub shall be permitted to seek Damages in
excess of the Company Termination Fee. If the Company fails to timely pay any
amount due pursuant to _Section 7.02(b)_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amount set forth in _Section 7.02(b)_ , the Company shall pay
to Parent interest on such amount at the prime rate of J.P. Morgan, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

Section 7.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended in writing by the
parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires
further approval by the shareholders of the Company without the further
approval of such shareholders and (b) no amendment shall be made to this
Agreement after the Effective Time. Except as required by Law, no amendment
of this Agreement by the Company shall require the approval of the
shareholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties.

  



  

Section 7.04 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other,
(b) waive any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of
the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance by the other with any of the covenants or conditions
contained herein. No extension or waiver or termination of this Agreement by
the Company shall require the approval of the Company's shareholders unless
such approval is required by Law. Any extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of such right.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII

Section 8.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 8.05 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or
transferred, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of
the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties,
except that Sub may assign all or any of their rights and obligations under
this Agreement to any affiliate of Parent; _provided_ that no such assignment
shall (a) relieve the assigning party of its obligations under this Agreement
if such assignee does not perform such obligations, or (b) be permitted if it
would, or would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing. Any
assignment or transfer in violation of the preceding sentence shall be void.
Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

Section 8.06 _Parties in Interest_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person (other than the
parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement, except for, (a) the right of the Company's
shareholders to receive the Merger Consideration under _ARTICLE II_ , and
(b) the right of each Indemnified Party (and such Indemnified Party's heirs,
executors or administrators and each Indemnified Party's representatives)
under _Section 5.10_. The representations, warranties and covenants set forth
in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto, in

parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties may be subject to waiver
by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 7.04_ without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties
hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the
date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  



  

Section 8.07 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation; Headings_. Each party hereto
has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If
an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or

Jury_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,

certificate representing a Share (a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated

--- 

 



    



  

(ii)  _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All

and shall cease to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

  



  

(iii)  _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock of Sub, par value $0.25 per share, shall be automatically converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.25 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, all certificates representing common stock of Sub shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(b)  _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in the
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of the Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class (including by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution
thereon shall be declared with a record date and payment date within such
period), the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change so as to provide Parent and the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by the Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ ,
_that_ nothing in this _Section 2.01(b)_ shall be deemed to permit or
authorize the Company to effect any such change that it is prohibited from
undertaking pursuant to the Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

  



  

(a)  _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
U.S.-based nationally recognized financial institution reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the
holders of Shares to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holders
shall become entitled pursuant to the Agreement. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal to the sum of the
Aggregate Common Stock Consideration (as defined in the Agreement) (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be held in trust by the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares that are entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration. In the event the Exchange Fund is
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this _ARTICLE II_ , Parent
shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash such that the
Exchange Fund becomes sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available
to the Paying Agent shall, if Parent so elects, be invested by the Paying
Agent, as directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United
States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ ; 
_provided_ that no investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the
payments required by this _ARTICLE II_ , and following any losses from any
such investment, Parent shall promptly deposit with the Paying Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, for the benefit of the holders
of Shares, an amount in cash equal to the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds
initially deposited with the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated by
this _ARTICLE II_. Any interest or income produced by such investments will
be payable to Sub or Parent, as Parent directs. Parent shall direct the Paying
Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the persons entitled to
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01_  and to make payments
from the Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Section 2.02_. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant
to this _Section 2.02_ , except as expressly provided for in the Agreement.

  



    


--- 

 



    



  

(b)  _Procedures for Surrender_.

  



  

(i)  _Certificated Shares_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time (but in no event later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Agreement: (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to
the Effective Time), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section 2.02(e)_ ) to the Paying Agent; and (B) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of any Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_ ) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, if applicable, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal,
duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates and such
other documents as may be customarily required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant
to _Section 2.01_ , and the Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and
Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is
properly endorsed or is otherwise in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment either pays to the Paying Agent any transfer and
other similar Taxes (as defined in the Agreement) required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate so surrendered or establishes to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not required to be paid.

  



  

(ii)  _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each
registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon
the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event more than two (2)
Business Days thereafter), the Merger Consideration for each Book-Entry Share.
Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered.

(iii)  _No Interest_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of
the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_ ) or in
respect of any Book-Entry Share.

  



  

(c)  _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _ARTICLE II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, subject, however, to
_Section 2.05_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for in the
Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates
formerly representing Shares (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_ ) are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in the Agreement.

  



  

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with
respect thereto) not disbursed to or claimed by holders of Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of their Shares in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section 2.02(b)_ , without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Share for Merger Consideration properly delivered to a
Governmental Entity (as defined in the Agreement) in accordance with any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on
which the Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become
the property of Parent or Sub, as Parent directs, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(e)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate has been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent) of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration
into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were converted
pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_.

Section 2.03 _Treatment of Company Options, RSU Awards, ESPP and Equity
Plans_.

  



  

(a)  _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the board
of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") (or, if appropriate,
any committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions that provide that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the Merger, each outstanding
option to purchase Shares granted under a Company Stock Plan (as defined in
the Agreement) (other than any option granted under the MTS Systems
Corporation 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company Stock Purchase
Plan_ ")) (the " _Company Options_ ") shall be fully vested and
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled
Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in
cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares
subject to such cancelled Company Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Share
subject to such cancelled Company Option, without interest (such amounts
payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
(1) any such Company Option with respect to which the exercise price per
Share subject thereto is equal or greater than the Merger Consideration shall
be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (2) such Option Payments
shall be reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section 2.05_. From and after the Effective Time, no Company Option shall
be outstanding or exercisable, and each Company Option shall entitle the
holder thereof only to the payment provided for in this _Section 2.03(a)_.

  



  

(b)  _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions that provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time and
contingent upon the Merger, (A) each outstanding award of restricted stock
units with respect to Shares (including, for the avoidance of doubt, each such
restricted stock unit that is subject to a deferral election) (each, an "
_RSU Award_ ") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan shall be fully
vested; _provided_ , _however_ , that each RSU Award that is subject to
performance-based vesting conditions shall be deemed to be vested at the
greater of (1) actual performance determined as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (2) target level and (B) each RSU Award shall be cancelled
and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSU Award shall
be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such RSU Award
and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the
product of (1) the number of vested restricted stock units subject to such RSU
Award, multiplied by (2) the Merger Consideration, without interest (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_ ).

  



  

(c)  _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions that provide that, as of the Effective Time, all Company Stock
Plans shall terminate, and no further rights with respect to Shares or any
other awards shall be granted thereunder.

  



  

(d)  _Treatment of Company Stock Purchase Plan_. The provisions of _Section
2.03(a)_ shall not apply to any rights under the Company Stock Purchase Plan.
With respect to the Company Stock Purchase Plan, as soon as practicable
following the date of the Agreement, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) shall adopt resolutions or take other actions as may be required
to provide that no further "Phases" (as defined in the Company Stock Purchase
Plan) will commence pursuant to the Company Stock Purchase Plan after the
date hereof and that any money withheld from a participant's pay pursuant to
the Company Stock Purchase Plan that has not been used to purchase Shares at
the end of the final Phase shall be returned to the applicable
participant. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time, the
Company will terminate the Company Stock Purchase Plan (unless the Company
Stock Purchase Plan has terminated earlier pursuant to its terms).

(e)  _Deferred Compensation_. Parent shall cause the Company to pay on the
Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter all deferred compensation
under any deferred compensation plans of the Company (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in  _Section 2.05_ ) in accordance with the terms of
the applicable plan.

  



  

(f)  _Parent Funding_. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
through the Surviving Corporation's payroll agent to each holder of a Company
Option or RSU Award the applicable Option Payments or RSU Payments, as
applicable (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_
) on the Surviving Corporation's first regularly scheduled payroll date
occurring at least five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, or at
such later time as necessary to avoid a violation of, or adverse tax
consequences under, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the " _Code_ ").

  



  

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement
to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held of record or beneficially by a person who has not
voted in favor of approval and adoption of the Agreement and who is entitled
to demand and properly exercises dissenters' rights with respect to such
Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (the "
_Dissenters Rights_ "), shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration for such Dissenting Shares but instead shall
be entitled to payment of the fair value (including interest determined in
accordance with Section 302A.473 of the MBCA) of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the Dissenters Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to dissent under the Dissenters Rights, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. The
Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the
Company for Dissenters Rights with respect to any Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

Section 2.05 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent (and their respective affiliates) (each, a " _Payor_ ")
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts payable in connection
with the Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, any
regulation promulgated thereunder by the United States Department of Treasury
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that under no circumstance will a Payor deduct or withhold any
amount under Section 1445 of the Code so long as the Company provides the
certification and notice described in Section 5.13 of the Agreement. After the
date of the Agreement, the Company will (and will cause the Company
Subsidiaries to) reasonably cooperate with any reasonable request of Parent in
connection with determining whether any withholding Taxes are applicable to
payments made in connection with the Agreement. In the event that Parent
determines that any such withholding Taxes are applicable, (i) Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Company prior to the date
on which such withholding is anticipated to occur, (ii) Parent and the Company
shall reasonably cooperate to minimize or eliminate such withholding Taxes as
permitted by applicable Law and (iii) without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent to
minimize any such withholding Taxes in accordance with applicable Law.. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted by a Payor, such withheld
amounts (a) shall be remitted by such Payor to the applicable Governmental
Entity and (b) to the extent so remitted shall be treated for all purposes of
the Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by such Payor.
