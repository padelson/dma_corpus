 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated August 20, 2020,
is made by and among Enterprise Financial Services Corp, a Delaware
corporation ("Enterprise"), Enterprise Bank and Trust, a Missouri state-
chartered trust company with banking powers and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Enterprise ("EBandT"), Seacoast Commerce Banc Holdings, a California corporation
("Seacoast"), and Seacoast Commerce Bank, a California chartered commercial
bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of Seacoast ("Seacoast Bank").

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Enterprise and Seacoast
have determined that this Agreement and the business combination and related
transactions contemplated hereby are fair to, and in the best interests of,
their respective entities and shareholders and consistent with and in
furtherance of their respective business strategies;

WHEREAS, in accordance with the terms, and subject to the conditions, of this
Agreement, (i) Seacoast will merge with and into Enterprise, with Enterprise
as the surviving entity (the "Merger"), and thereafter (ii) Seacoast Bank will
merge with and into EBandT, with EBandT as the surviving entity (the "Bank
Merger");

WHEREAS, for United States federal income Tax purposes, the parties intend
that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code (a "368 Reorganization") and intend for this
Agreement to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(g) of the Regulations;

WHEREAS, as a material inducement and as additional consideration to
Enterprise to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and certain
officers of Seacoast solely in their capacity as shareholders of Seacoast,
have entered into a voting agreement with Enterprise dated as of the date
hereof, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A (collectively, the
"Voting Agreements"), pursuant to which each such Person has agreed, among
other things, to vote all shares of Seacoast Stock owned by such Person in
favor of the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Voting Agreements;

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement and
to prescribe certain conditions thereto; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire that capitalized terms used herein shall have the
definitions ascribed to such terms when they are first used herein or as
otherwise specified in Article 8 hereof.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE 1.

THE MERGER



Section 1.01 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Seacoast shall merge with and into
Enterprise in accordance with the DGCL and the CGCL. Upon consummation of the
Merger, at the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Seacoast
shall cease and Enterprise shall survive and continue to exist as a
corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (Enterprise,
as the surviving entity in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as
the "Surviving Entity").

Section 1.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity upon consummation of the
Merger at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of Enterprise as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Section 1.03 Directors and Officers of Surviving Entity.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 1.03(b), the directors and officers
of Enterprise immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after
the Effective Time, serve as directors and officers of the Surviving Entity.

(b) Subject to compliance with applicable Law (including, to the extent
applicable, the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq (or other Trading
Market on which the Enterprise Common Stock is then listed or quoted)), prior
to the Effective Time, Enterprise shall take all necessary corporate or other
action so that from and after the Effective Time, at the election of
Enterprise, either (i) the size of the board of directors of Enterprise (the
"Enterprise Board") is increased by one member, or (ii) one of the then
incumbent directors resigns from the Enterprise Board, and in either case one
member of the Seacoast Board who is independent with respect to Enterprise for
purposes of the listing requirements of Nasdaq (or other Trading Market on
which the Enterprise Common Stock is then listed or quoted), selected by
mutual agreement of Seacoast and Enterprise (the "Seacoast Director"), is
elected or appointed to the Enterprise Board to fill the vacancy on the
Enterprise Board created by such increase or resignation, as applicable.
Enterprise, through the Enterprise Board and subject to the Enterprise Board's
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Enterprise, shall take all necessary
action to nominate the Seacoast Director for election to the Enterprise Board
in the proxy statement relating to the first annual meeting of the
shareholders of Enterprise following the Closing. Until the Effective Time,
Seacoast shall cause the Seacoast Board to maintain at least one director who
is a member of the Seacoast Board on the date of this Agreement and who is
independent with respect to Enterprise for purposes of the listing
requirements of Nasdaq (or other Trading Market on which the Enterprise Common
Stock is then listed or quoted). Section 1.04 Bank Merger.

(a) At such time following the Effective Time as Enterprise may determine,
Seacoast Bank will be merged with and into EBandT upon the terms and with the
effect set forth in the Plan of Bank Merger, the form of which is attached
hereto as Exhibit B.

(b) The directors and officers of EBandT immediately prior to the effective time
of the Bank Merger shall, from and after such effective time, serve as
directors and officers of EBandT, as the surviving bank.

Section 1.05 Effective Time; Closing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Enterprise and
Seacoast will make all such filings as may be required by applicable Laws to
consummate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon filing the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on
the Closing Date or such later date and/or time as may be specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time"). Promptly thereafter, Enterprise
shall file a copy of the Certificate of Merger certified by the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware with the Secretary of State of the State of
California.

(b) The Bank Merger shall become effective as set forth in the Plan of Bank
Merger. Promptly following effectiveness of the Bank Merger, EBandT shall file a
copy of the articles of merger certified by the Missouri Division of Finance
with the Secretary of State of the State of California and the CDBO. Seacoast
Bank shall execute such certificates or articles of combination and such other
documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by Enterprise to
effectuate the Bank Merger.

(c) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place on such date and at such time as Enterprise and
Seacoast mutually agree, which such date shall be no later than fifteen (15)
days after all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article 6 (other
than conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, which shall be satisfied or
waived at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the
terms hereof (such date, the "Closing Date") remotely via the electronic
exchange of documentation between the parties (via electronic transmission or
other similar means for exchanging documentation), or at such place as
Enterprise and Seacoast may mutually agree.

Section 1.06 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Enterprise shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other actions are necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Seacoast, Seacoast Bank
and their respective Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have granted to
Enterprise an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver, in its
official corporate capacity, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law
and to take any other actions as are necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of Enterprise are
authorized in the name of Seacoast, Seacoast Bank and their respective
Subsidiaries to execute and deliver any and all such deeds, assignments or
assurances in Law and to take any and all such actions. 

Section 1.07 Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. At Enterprise's
election, without the approval of Seacoast, the business combination
contemplated by this Agreement may alternatively be structured so that (a)
Seacoast is merged with and into any other direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Enterprise, (b) any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary
of Enterprise is merged with and into Seacoast, (c) Seacoast Bank is merged
with and into any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of EBandT,
(d) any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of EBandT is merged with and
into Seacoast Bank, (e) EBandT is merged with and into Seacoast Bank, or (f) the
Bank Merger is delayed or abandoned and each of Seacoast Bank and EBandT
continue to operate as separate banking Subsidiaries of Enterprise; provided,
however, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the Merger
Consideration, (ii) impede or delay consummation of the Merger (including any
Closing Regulatory Approval), (iii) adversely alter or change the United
States federal income Tax treatment of holders of Seacoast Stock in connection
with the Merger from what such treatment would have been absent such change
(including, but not limited to, any such change that would result in the
Merger failing to qualify as a 368 Reorganization), (iv) require submission to
or approval of Seacoast's shareholders after the plan of merger set forth in
this Agreement has been submitted to or approved by Seacoast's shareholders,
or (v) otherwise adversely affect Seacoast, Seacoast Bank or any shareholder
of Seacoast in any material respect. In the event that Enterprise elects to
make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents
reasonably required to reflect the change.

ARTICLE 2

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES



Section 2.01 Stock. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Enterprise, Seacoast or any shareholder of Seacoast:

(a) Each share of Enterprise Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

(b) Each share of Seacoast Stock owned directly by Enterprise, Seacoast or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, as treasury stock or otherwise (other than
shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit of
customers), immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Article 2, each share of Seacoast
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, shares of Seacoast Common Stock
underlying Seacoast Stock Awards) (other than Seacoast Common Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive 0.5061 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of
Enterprise Common Stock. (d) After the Effective Time, all shares of Seacoast Common Stock shall no
longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, except as to Dissenting Shares, and shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Stock Consideration and each holder of
a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

Section 2.02 Stock Options and Other Stock Based Awards.

(a) Unless otherwise noted, the provisions of this Section 2.02(a) pertain to
all options to acquire shares of Seacoast Common Stock which are outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Seacoast Options"). Enterprise and Seacoast shall take all action necessary
so that, at the Effective Time, each Seacoast Option granted under any
Seacoast Benefit Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be canceled and extinguished at the
Effective Time and exchanged for the right to receive (without interest) an
amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Seacoast Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Seacoast Option and (ii)
the excess, if any, of (A) the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the
Average VWAP as of the Trading Day immediately preceding the Closing Date over
(B) the per-share exercise price of such Seacoast Option (the "Option
Consideration"), less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such cash payment. Seacoast shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to obtain the written acknowledgement of each holder of a then-
outstanding Seacoast Option with regard to the cancellation of such Seacoast
Option and the payment therefor in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

(b) The provisions of this Section 2.02(b) pertain to all restricted stock
units and other stock-based awards granted by Seacoast, including but not
limited to awards granted under the Seacoast Stock Plans, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time except for Seacoast
Options (collectively, the "Seacoast Stock Awards"). Enterprise and Seacoast
shall take all action necessary so that, at the Effective Time, each Seacoast
Stock Award that is unsettled or unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time will vest at the Effective Time and be free of any restrictions and be
exchanged for the Stock Consideration.

Section 2.03 Merger Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, the total
consideration to be paid by Enterprise in the Merger (the "Merger
Consideration") is (a) the aggregate number of shares of Enterprise Common
Stock to be issued to holders of Seacoast Common Stock, pursuant to Section
2.01(c) and Section 2.02Section 2.02(b) above, plus cash in lieu of any
fractional share interest paid pursuant to Section 2.04 (the "Stock
Consideration"), and (b) the aggregate amount of Option Consideration payable
to holders of Seacoast Options pursuant to Section 2.02(a) above.

Section 2.04 Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Enterprise Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. Each holder of shares of Seacoast Common Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Enterprise Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, an amount of cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by
multiplying the fractional share (rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a
share) by the Average VWAP as of the Trading Day immediately preceding the
Closing Date.

Section 2.05 Plan of Reorganization. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a 368 Reorganization, and that this Agreement shall constitute a
"plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code and Section 1.368-2(g) of the Regulations. From and after the date of
this Agreement and until the Closing, each party hereto shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a 368 Reorganization, and
each of Enterprise and Seacoast shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to obtain the opinions referred to in Section 6.01(e).

Section 2.06 Dissenting Shares. Each outstanding share of Seacoast Common
Stock the holder of which has perfected his, her or its right to dissent
pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL, including making a demand of Seacoast to
purchase his, her or its shares pursuant to Section 1301 of Chapter 13 of the
CGCL and submitting his, her or its shares for endorsement pursuant to Section
1302 of Chapter 13 of the CGCL, and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
right as of the Effective Time (the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the Stock Consideration, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the
CGCL. Seacoast shall give Enterprise prompt notice upon receipt by Seacoast of
any such written demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of
Seacoast Common Stock and of withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments provided pursuant to the CGCL. If any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), the Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be
converted on a share by share basis into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.
Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by Enterprise
within the time period set forth in the CGCL.

Section 2.07 Deposit of Merger Consideration.

(a) The Surviving Entity shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Option
Consideration to holders of Seacoast Options through the next administratively
practicable payroll following the Effective Time.

(b) At or before the Effective Time, Enterprise shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent stock certificates or, at
Enterprise's option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the
number of shares of Enterprise Common Stock issuable to the holders of
Seacoast Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(c) above and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.04 (collectively, the "Exchange
Fund"), and Enterprise shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay such
Stock Consideration from the Exchange Fund in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

(c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed as of the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (as well as any interest or proceeds from any
investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Enterprise.
Any former shareholders of Seacoast who have not theretofore complied with Section 2.08 shall thereafter look only
to Enterprise for payment of the Stock Consideration. If any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the time that is
immediately prior to the time at which the Stock Consideration in respect of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Entity, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement
shall be liable to any holder of Seacoast Common Stock represented by any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Stock Consideration which is paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

Section 2.08 Exchange Procedures.

(a) Enterprise shall cause the Exchange Agent, as soon as practicable after
the Effective Time but in no event later than ten (10) days thereafter, to
mail to each holder of a Certificate and each holder of a Book-Entry Share(s),
(i) a letter of transmittal ("Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or,
in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares, for payment of
the Stock Consideration. The Letter of Transmittal shall be subject to the
approval of Seacoast (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share(s), together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share(s) shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a (i) a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry
form, as applicable) representing the number of shares of Enterprise Common
Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 2, and (ii) a check in the amount equal to (A) the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Enterprise Common Stock pursuant
to Section 2.04 and (B) any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.08(d). No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Stock Consideration
payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.08(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive, upon surrender, the Stock Consideration.

(c) In the event a transfer of ownership of a Certificate is not registered in
the stock transfer records of Seacoast, the Stock Consideration payable with
respect to such Certificate shall be issued or paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate is registered if (i) such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, (ii)
the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar required by reason of the issuance to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of
Enterprise, that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable, and (iii) the
Person requesting such issuance or payment shall have complied with the
provisions of the Letter of Transmittal. In the event of a dispute with
respect to ownership of any shares of Seacoast Common Stock represented by any
Certificate, Enterprise and Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the
custody of any court of competent jurisdiction any Stock Consideration payable
with respect to such Certificate and file Legal Proceedings interpleading all
parties to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

(d) If a dividend or other distribution is declared by Enterprise in respect
of the Enterprise Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, such declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of Enterprise Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of
the Enterprise Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
are surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article 2. Subject to
applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares and the issuance of Enterprise Common Stock in exchange therefor, there

of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender payable with respect to

date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such
Enterprise Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender.

(e) The parties intend that no withholding shall be required with respect to
the Merger. However, Enterprise (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Seacoast Common Stock or Seacoast
Options such amounts as Enterprise is required to deduct and withhold under
applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holder in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Enterprise or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable.

Section 2.09 Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event that before the Effective
Time Enterprise changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number
of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Enterprise Common Stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
reclassification, exchange or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Enterprise Common Stock, the Merger Consideration will be
appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide the holders of Seacoast
Common Stock, Seacoast Options and Seacoast Stock Awards the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement based on the shares of Enterprise
Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to such event; provided, that for
the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to the
Enterprise Common Stock if (a) Enterprise repurchases outstanding shares of
Enterprise Common Stock, (b) Enterprise issues additional shares of Enterprise
Common Stock and receives consideration for such shares in a bona fide third party transaction, or (c) Enterprise issues employee or
director stock options, restricted stock awards, grants or similar equity
awards or Enterprise issues Enterprise Common Stock upon exercise or vesting
of any such options, grants or awards.

Section 2.10 Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Enterprise or the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Enterprise may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Stock Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
general equity principles.

(e) All currently outstanding Seacoast Loans were solicited, originated and
administered, and currently exist, and the relevant Loan files are being

Enterprise true, correct and complete copies of all deeds, surveys, title
insurance policies, mortgages, deeds of trust and security agreements, and

Seacoast nor any Seacoast Subsidiary has received a written or, to Seacoast's
Knowledge, oral notice of any material default on the part of the Seacoast or
any Seacoast Subsidiary or early termination with respect to any Lease. There

constitute a breach) by Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary of any material
covenant, agreement, or condition contained in a Lease. To Seacoast's
Knowledge, no lessor under a Lease is in breach or default of any material
covenant, agreement or condition contained in such Lease. Seacoast and each

Seacoast Intellectual Property by Seacoast or a Seacoast Subsidiary, and (ii)
there is no default or expected default by any party to, or any intent to
terminate or let expire, any Contract related to Seacoast Intellectual
Property. To Seacoast's Knowledge, there are no outstanding options, licenses,
agreements, claims, encumbrances or shared ownership interests of any kind
relating to the Seacoast Intellectual Property represented to be owned by Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary, nor is Seacoast or any
Seacoast Subsidiary bound by or a party to any options, licenses or agreements
of any kind with respect to the patents, trademarks, service marks, trade
names, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, information, proprietary rights
and processes of any other Person.

(b) The Seacoast Intellectual Property constitutes all of the Intellectual
Property used to carry on the business of Seacoast and the Seacoast
Subsidiaries as currently conducted. Neither Seacoast nor any Seacoast
Subsidiary has embedded or permitted to be embedded any open source, copyleft
or community source code in any of its products or services generally
available or in development, including but not limited to any libraries, that
provide for or permit such code or any of Seacoast Intellectual Property's

or a Seacoast Subsidiary is valid and enforceable and has not been cancelled,
forfeited, expired or abandoned, and neither Seacoast nor any Seacoast
Subsidiary has received any written or, to Seacoast's Knowledge, oral notice
challenging the validity or enforceability of any Seacoast Intellectual
Property.

as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance
by Seacoast and Seacoast Bank of its obligations hereunder, in violation of
any material Contracts to which Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary is a party
and pursuant to which Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary is authorized to use
any third-party patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets,
computer software or other intellectual property. Neither Seacoast nor any
Seacoast Subsidiary has received notice challenging Seacoast's or any Seacoast
Subsidiary's license or legally enforceable right to use any such third-party
intellectual property rights. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not result in the loss or impairment of the right of
Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary (or Enterprise or any Enterprise
Subsidiary post-Closing) to own or use any material Seacoast Intellectual
Property.

(e) With respect to any Seacoast Intellectual Property that is an intent-to-
use trademark application ("ITU"), this Agreement provides for the assumption
of the entire business of Seacoast to which that respective ITU pertains, such
business of Seacoast will be ongoing and existing immediately upon
consummation of the Merger, and Enterprise will be the successor in interest
of such business of Seacoast.

(f) To Seacoast's Knowledge, neither Seacoast nor any Seacoast Subsidiary has
interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated, or otherwise violated any
Intellectual Property rights of any other Person, and neither Seacoast nor any
Seacoast Subsidiary has ever received any written or, to Seacoast's Knowledge,
oral charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any such
interference, infringement, misappropriation or violation (including any claim
that Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary must license or refrain from using
any Intellectual Property rights of any other Person). To Seacoast's

Property. All Contracts related to Seacoast Intellectual Property are valid
and enforceable by or against Seacoast or a Seacoast Subsidiary, as

and enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity or by

(iii) at no time during the two years prior to the date hereof, has received
any written notice asserting any violations of any of the foregoing. The
execution of this Agreement and the transfer of all such personal data and

such Laws, privacy policies or commitments. Immediately upon the Closing, Enterprise and the Enterprise
Subsidiaries will continue to have the right to use such personal information
on identical terms and conditions as Seacoast and the Seacoast Subsidiaries
enjoyed immediately prior to the Closing. To Seacoast's Knowledge, no Person
(including any Governmental Authority) has commenced or, to Seacoast's
Knowledge, threatened any Legal Proceeding relating to Seacoast or any
Seacoast Subsidiary's information privacy or data security practices,
including with respect to the collection, use, transfer, storage, or disposal

Bank Merger from qualifying as a 368 Reorganization.

(e) Commitments. Agree to take, make any commitment to take, or adopt any
resolutions of the Enterprise Board in support of, any of the actions
prohibited by this Section 5.02.

Section 5.03 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties to the Agreement agrees to
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws,
so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable, including the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Article 6 hereof, and shall cooperate fully with the other parties
hereto to that end; provided, that this Section 5.03 will not require
Enterprise to agree to, or take, any Burdensome Condition.

Section 5.04 Seacoast Shareholder Approval.

(a) Following the execution of this Agreement, Seacoast shall take, in
accordance with applicable Law and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of
Seacoast, all action necessary to convene a special meeting of its
shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
forty-five (45) days following the time when the Registration Statement
becomes effective, subject to extension with the consent of Enterprise (not to
be unreasonably withheld or conditioned)) to consider and vote upon the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger) and any other matters required to be approved by Seacoast's
shareholders in order to permit consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the "Seacoast Meeting"), and shall, subject to Section 5.10 and the
last sentence of this Section 5.04(a), use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to solicit such approval by such shareholders. Subject to Section 5.10 and the
last sentence of this Section 5.04(a), Seacoast shall use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain the Requisite Seacoast Shareholder Approval to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Except
with the prior approval of Enterprise, no other matters shall be submitted for
the approval of Seacoast shareholders at the Seacoast Meeting. If the Seacoast
Board makes a Seacoast Subsequent Determination in accordance with Section
5.10, Seacoast shall not be required to use its Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to solicit shareholders to approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) or to use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain the Requisite Seacoast Shareholder Approval to
consummate the Merger.

(b) Except to the extent provided otherwise in Section 5.10, (a) the Seacoast
Board shall at all times prior to and during the Seacoast Meeting recommend
approval by the shareholders of Seacoast of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), and any other matters
required to be approved by Seacoast's shareholders for consummation of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Seacoast
Recommendation") and (b) the Proxy Statement-Prospectus shall include the
Seacoast Recommendation. In the event that there are sufficient shares of
Seacoast Common Stock represented (in Person or by proxy) at the Seacoast
Meeting to secure the Requisite Seacoast Shareholder Approval, Seacoast will
not adjourn or postpone the Seacoast Meeting unless the Seacoast Board
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with the advice of
counsel, that (i) such adjournment or postponement is required by applicable
Law in order to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus is provided to the holders of Seacoast Common Stock with
a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Seacoast Meeting or (ii) failure
to do so would otherwise breach or reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Seacoast
shall keep Enterprise updated with respect to the proxy solicitation results
in connection with the Seacoast Meeting as reasonably requested by Enterprise.

(c) Except to the extent provided otherwise in Section 5.10, Seacoast shall
adjourn or postpone the Seacoast Meeting, if, as of the time for which the
Seacoast Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of
Seacoast Common Stock represented (either in Person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting or, if on the date
of the Seacoast Meeting, Seacoast has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Seacoast
Shareholder Approval. Seacoast shall only be required to adjourn or postpone
the Seacoast Meeting two times to the first sentence of this Section 5.04(c).

Section 5.05 Takeover Laws. Enterprise shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to exempt (or cause the continued exemption of) this Agreement, the
Merger and the Bank Merger from the requirements of any applicable
antitakeover statute or regulation and from any similar provisions under the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Enterprise and the organizational
documents of EBandT.

Section 5.06 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement-Prospectus; Nasdaq
Listing.

(a) Enterprise and Seacoast agree to cooperate in the preparation of the
Registration Statement to be filed by Enterprise with the SEC in connection
with the issuance of Enterprise Common Stock in the Merger (including the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all related documents). Seacoast shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to deliver to Enterprise such financial
statements and related analysis of Seacoast as may be required by Law in order
to file the Registration Statement and any other report required to be filed
by Enterprise with the SEC, in each case, in compliance with applicable Laws
and shall provide Enterprise with any other information concerning itself that
Enterprise may reasonably request in connection with the drafting and
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus.
Enterprise agrees to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC within sixty (60) days from
the date hereof, and to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. Seacoast agrees to cooperate
with Enterprise and Enterprise's counsel and accountants in requesting and
obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from Seacoast's
independent auditors in connection with the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus. After the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act, Seacoast, at its own expense, shall
promptly mail or cause to be mailed the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its
shareholders.

(b) Enterprise shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to ensure that the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus and the Registration Statement shall comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of
Enterprise and Seacoast agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none
of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time
it is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented, or at the
time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement-Prospectus
will, at the date of mailing to shareholders, at the time of the Seacoast
Meeting, or at any time it is amended or supplemented, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading. Each of
Enterprise and Seacoast further agrees that if it becomes aware that any
information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to
correct the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement-Prospectus.
Enterprise will advise Seacoast, promptly after Enterprise receives notice
thereof, (A) of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective
or any supplement or amendment has been filed, (B) of the issuance of any stop
order or the suspension of the qualification of Enterprise Common Stock for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction or of the initiation or threat of any
proceeding for any such purpose, and (C) of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or upon the receipt of
any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or its staff. Enterprise
will provide Seacoast and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on (and will consider such comments in good faith) (x) the
Registration Statement (including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus) prior to its
being filed with the SEC, (y) all amendments and supplements to the
Registration Statement (including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus) and, (z)
except to the extent such response is submitted under confidential cover, all
responses to requests for additional information and replies to comments of
the SEC, prior to their being filed with, or sent to the SEC, and reasonable
good faith consideration shall be given to any comments made by Seacoast and
its counsel. Enterprise will provide Seacoast and its counsel with a copy of
all such filings made with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Seacoast
Meeting there shall occur any event that should be disclosed in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration Statement,
Enterprise shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to promptly prepare and
file such amendment or supplement with the SEC (if required under applicable
Law) and cooperate with Seacoast to mail such amendment or supplement to
Seacoast shareholders (if required under applicable Law).

(c) Enterprise agrees to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the
shares of Enterprise Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger
to be approved for listing on Nasdaq (or other Trading Market on which the
Enterprise Common Stock is then listed or quoted), subject to official notice
of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

Section 5.07 Regulatory Filings; Consents.

(a) Each of Enterprise and Seacoast and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts (i) to prepare all
documentation (including the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement-
Prospectus), and Enterprise shall make, all filings with, to send all notices
to, and to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of, all
third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation, the
Closing Regulatory Approvals and the consents, approvals and notices under the
Contracts set forth on Section 3.05(c), (ii) to comply with the terms and
conditions of such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and (iii)
to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as
expeditiously as practicable; provided, however, that in no event shall
Enterprise be required to agree to any prohibition, limitation, or other
requirement which would (A) materially prohibit or materially limit the
ownership or operation by Enterprise or any Enterprise Subsidiary (including
Seacoast and any Seacoast Subsidiary after Closing) of all or any material
portion of its business or assets, (B) compel Enterprise or any Enterprise
Subsidiary (including Seacoast and any Seacoast Subsidiary after Closing) to
dispose of all or any material portion of its business or assets, (C) cause
any portion of any Seacoast Regulatory Agreement to be enforceable against
Enterprise or EBandT after the Merger, or (D) be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Entity, taken as a whole (together,
the "Burdensome Conditions"). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than sixty (60) days
after the date of this Agreement, Enterprise and Seacoast shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare, and Enterprise shall
file, any applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain the
Closing Regulatory Approvals and any other Permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger and the Bank Merger).
Subject to applicable Law, (w) Enterprise and Seacoast will furnish each other
and each other's counsel with all information concerning themselves, their
Subsidiaries, directors, trustees, officers and shareholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with
obtaining any Regulatory Approval, (x) each party hereto shall have the right
to review and approve in advance all characterizations of the information
relating to such party and any of its Subsidiaries that appear in any filing
made in connection with obtaining any Regulatory Approval, (y) Enterprise and
Seacoast shall each furnish to the other for review a copy of each such filing
made in connection with obtaining any Regulatory Approval prior to its filing
and (z) Enterprise and Seacoast will notify the other promptly and shall
promptly furnish the other with copies of any communication from any
Governmental Authority received by it with respect to the effort to obtain and
receipt of Regulatory Approvals (and its response thereto); provided, that in
no event shall Enterprise, EBandT, Seacoast or Seacoast Bank be obligated to
provide or otherwise disclose to the other confidential supervisory
information regarding themselves, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates.

(b) Seacoast will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, and Enterprise shall
reasonably cooperate with Seacoast at Seacoast's request, to obtain all
consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations with
respect to any Contracts set forth on Section 3.05(c) of the Seacoast
Disclosure Schedule and all Leases set forth on Section 3.30(e) of the
Seacoast Disclosure Schedule; provided, that, except as otherwise contemplated
by this Agreement, neither Seacoast nor any Seacoast Subsidiary will be
required to make any payment to or grant any concessions to any third party in
connection therewith. Each party will, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, notify the other party promptly and promptly furnish the other party with
copies of notices or other communications received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or
another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the response thereto from such party, its Subsidiaries or its
representatives). Seacoast and Enterprise will reasonably consult with each
other and their respective representatives so as to permit Seacoast and
Enterprise and their respective representatives to be knowledgeable regarding
the status of such effort, cooperate to take appropriate measures to obtain
such consents and avoid or mitigate any adverse consequences that may result
from the foregoing.

Section 5.08 Publicity. Enterprise and Seacoast shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld; provided, however, that
Enterprise and Seacoast may, without the prior consent of the other party (but
after such consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances),
issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the advice
of counsel be required by Law or the rules and regulations of the SEC or
Nasdaq (or other Trading Market on which the Enterprise Common Stock is then
listed or quoted). It is understood that Enterprise shall assume primary
responsibility for the preparation of joint press releases relating to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.09 Access; Current Information.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time
(or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 7),
Seacoast and Enterprise shall, for the purposes of verifying the
representations and warranties of Enterprise and EBandT and Seacoast and
Seacoast Bank, respectively, and preparing for the Merger and the other
matters contemplated by this Agreement, (i) upon reasonable notice and subject
to applicable Laws, afford the other party and its officers, employees,
counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives access (subject to
any reasonable restrictions imposed by Seacoast or Enterprise with respect to
in-person access in light of COVID-19 concerns), during normal business hours,
to its and its Subsidiaries' books, records (including, without limitation,
Tax Returns and, subject to the consent of the independent auditors, work
papers of independent auditors), information technology systems, properties
and personnel and to such other information as the other party may reasonably
request, and (ii) furnish to the other party, upon reasonable request, all
such other information concerning its business, properties, personnel and
Subsidiaries that is substantially similar in scope to the information
provided to the other party in connection with its diligence review prior to
the date of this Agreement. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.09
shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of business of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time
(or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 7),
Seacoast will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer
with representatives of Enterprise and report the general status of its
ongoing operations, at such times and in such manner as Enterprise may
reasonably request. (c) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time
(or earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 7), each
of Enterprise and Seacoast will promptly notify the other party in writing of
any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the
date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described
in the Enterprise Disclosure Schedule or the Seacoast Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, or which is necessary to correct any information in such party's
Disclosure Schedule that has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. Each
such notice shall include, or be accompanied by, a proposed supplement or
amendment to such party's Disclosure Schedule regarding such matter (a
"Schedule Supplement"). Each Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to be
incorporated into and to supplement and amend the Seacoast Disclosure Schedule
or Enterprise Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that if the matter
which is the subject of the Schedule Supplement constitutes or relates to
something that could provide Enterprise with a right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01(e) and Enterprise does not elect to
terminate this Agreement prior to the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days
after the expiration of the applicable cure period and (ii) the Expiration
Date, then Enterprise shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to
terminate this Agreement on account of such matter.

(d) No investigation by a party or its representatives shall be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
other party or its Subsidiary bank set forth in this Agreement, or the
conditions to the respective obligations of Enterprise and Seacoast to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.09 to the contrary, no party
shall be required to provide the other party with access or disclose
information where such access or disclosure would, in the reasonable opinion
of such party's counsel, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the such
party, or contravene any binding Contract entered into by such party prior to
the date of this Agreement or any Law, Order or fiduciary duty applicable to
such party. In the event any of the restrictions in this Section 5.09(e) shall
apply, each party shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to make
appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional
specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and
to ensure compliance with applicable Laws.

Section 5.10 No Solicitation by Seacoast; Superior Proposals.

(a) Subject to Section 5.10(b), Seacoast and Seacoast Bank shall not, and
shall instruct their respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants,
Affiliates and other agents (collectively, the "Seacoast Representatives") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly
encourage, or knowingly take any action to facilitate the making of, any
inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise
afford access, to any Person (other than Enterprise or any Enterprise
Subsidiary) any information or data with respect to Seacoast or any Seacoast
Subsidiary or otherwise in furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
release any Person from, waive any provision of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill
agreement to which Seacoast is a party in furtherance of an Acquisition
Proposal; or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter
of intent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to
approve any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or
letter of intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement permitted by Section 5.10(a)); provided, however,
that nothing in this Section 5.10(a) shall prohibit Seacoast, the Seacoast
Board or any Seacoast Representative from making any inquiries with respect to
a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal solely for the purpose of
clarifying such Acquisition Proposal to enable the Seacoast Board to make the
determination described in Section 5.10(b). Any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by Seacoast or any Seacoast Representative, whether or not such
Seacoast Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Seacoast
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Seacoast or otherwise, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Seacoast. Seacoast and Seacoast
Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the Seacoast Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions,
negotiations, and communications with any Persons with respect to any existing
or potential Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.10(a) or any other provision of this Agreement,
at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Seacoast Shareholder Approval,
Seacoast may take any of the actions described in Section 5.10(a) if, but only
if, (i) Seacoast has received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.10; (ii) the
Seacoast Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (a) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (b) the failure to take such actions would breach or
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and (iii) prior to furnishing or affording access to any
information or data with respect to Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Seacoast receives from such
Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to Seacoast
than those contained in the confidentiality agreement with Enterprise (it
being understood that nothing therein shall have the effect of a standstill
provision). Seacoast shall promptly provide to Enterprise any non-public
information regarding Seacoast or Seacoast Subsidiaries provided to any other
Person which was not previously provided to Enterprise, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other party.

(c) Seacoast shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Enterprise in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, Seacoast or the Seacoast Representatives,
in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice
shall indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or
negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of
written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussion, providing copies of such materials (including
e-mails or other electronic communications), except to the extent that such
materials constitute confidential information of the party making such offer
or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement or any such disclosure would jeopardize attorney-
client privilege). Seacoast agrees that it shall keep Enterprise informed, on
a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposal,
offer, information request, negotiations or discussions (including any
amendments or modifications of any material terms to such proposal, offer or
request).

(d) Subject to Section 5.10(e), neither the Seacoast Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner
adverse in any respect to the interest of Enterprise, or take any other action
or make any other public statement inconsistent with, the Seacoast
Recommendation; (ii) fail to publicly affirm the Seacoast Recommendation
within five (5) Business Days following a request by Enterprise (or such fewer
number of days as remains prior to the Seacoast Meeting); (iii) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal; (iv) resolve to take, or publicly announce an intention to take, any
of the foregoing actions (each of (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) a "Seacoast
Subsequent Determination"); or (v) enter into (or cause Seacoast or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement (a) related to any Acquisition
Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5.10(b)) or (b) requiring Seacoast to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.10(d) or any other provision of this Agreement,
prior to obtaining the Requisite Seacoast Shareholder Approval, the Seacoast
Board (or any committee thereof) may make a Seacoast Subsequent Determination
after the fifth (5th) Business Day following Enterprise's receipt of a notice
(the "Notice of Determination") from Seacoast informing Enterprise that the
Seacoast Board (or such committee) has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a
Seacoast Subsequent Determination with respect to such Superior Proposal would
breach or reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law (it being understood that the initial determination under
this clause will not be considered a Seacoast Subsequent Determination), but
only if: (i) the Notice of Determination includes or is accompanied by the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of
the Person making such Superior Proposal, including copies of any proposed
material agreements providing for such Superior Proposal; (ii) during the five
(5) Business Day period after receipt of the Notice of Determination (the
"Notice Period"), Seacoast and the Seacoast Board shall have negotiated in
good faith with Enterprise, to the extent Enterprise desires to negotiate, to
make such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as would enable Seacoast to proceed with the Seacoast
Recommendation without a Seacoast Subsequent Determination; provided, however,
that Enterprise shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
(iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into account any such
adjusted, modified or amended terms, if any, as may have been proposed by
Enterprise in writing before expiration of the Notice Period, the Seacoast
Board has again in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor, made the determination that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a Seacoast
Subsequent Determination with respect to such Superior Proposal would breach or reasonably be expected to result in a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In the event of any material
revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of a Notice of
Determination and that occur prior to a Seacoast Subsequent Determination,
Seacoast shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Determination to
Enterprise and again comply with the requirements of this Section 5.10(e),
except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days.

Section 5.11 Indemnification.

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the articles of incorporation
and bylaws of Seacoast in effect on the date of this Agreement, and in any
event subject to the provisions of Section 5.11(b), Enterprise shall (i)
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors and officers of
Seacoast and Seacoast Bank (the "Indemnified Parties") against all costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, or liabilities incurred in connection with any actual or
threatened Legal Proceeding arising out of actions or omissions of such
Persons in the course of performing their duties for Seacoast or any Seacoast
Subsidiary occurring at or before the Effective Time (including in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a "Claim"), and
shall promptly advance expenses to each Indemnified Party from time-to-time as
incurred in connection with a Claim, to the same extent as the Indemnified
Parties have the right to expense advancement pursuant to applicable Law the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of Seacoast in effect on the date of this
Agreement; provided, that each Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides a reasonable and customary undertaking to repay such advances, if it
is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.11 shall promptly notify Enterprise upon learning of any Claim, provided,
that failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of Enterprise under
this Section 5.11, unless, and only to the extent that, Enterprise is
materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In the
event of any such Claim (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time), (i) (A) Enterprise shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and Enterprise shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses for other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, unless such
Indemnified Party is advised in writing by counsel that the defense of such
Indemnified Party by Enterprise would create an actual or potential conflict
of interest (in which case, Enterprise shall not be obligated to reimburse or
indemnify any Indemnified Party for the expenses of more than one separate
counsel in addition to one local counsel in the jurisdiction where defense of
any Claim has been or is to be asserted (if the Claim involves more than one
Indemnified Party, Enterprise shall only be obligated to pay for one separate
counsel and one local counsel for all Indemnified Parties)), and (B) such
Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (ii)
Enterprise shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
and Enterprise shall not settle any Claim without such Indemnified Party's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and (iii) Enterprise shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if such indemnification
would be in violation of any applicable United States federal or state banking
Laws or regulations, or in the event that a United States federal or state
banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Laws, whether or not related to banking Laws.

(c) Subject to the terms described in this Section 5.11(c), Enterprise shall
(i) maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years following the Effective
Time, Seacoast's current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
covering the Indemnified Parties, (ii) obtain, as of the Effective Time,
"tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years following the
Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing
terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties
as the policies currently provided by Seacoast, or (iii) purchase and provide
for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies from a carrier assigned a claims paying
ability rating by A.M. Best Seacoast, Inc. of "A (Excellent)" or higher with
at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions
that are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties as the policies
currently provided by Seacoast, in each case with respect to claims arising
out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall Enterprise be required to expend per
year pursuant to this Section 5.11(c) more than two hundred fifty percent
(250%) of the annual cost currently expended by Seacoast with respect to such
insurance (the "Maximum DandO Premium"); provided, further, that if the amount
of the annual premium necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Maximum DandO Premium, Enterprise shall maintain or procure the most
advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance (or "tail"
coverage obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum DandO Premium). In
connection with the foregoing, Seacoast agrees that in order for Enterprise to
fulfill its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.11(c), Indemnified Parties
may be required to provide such insurer or substitute insurer with such
reasonable and customary representations as such insurer may request.

(d) If, following the Effective Time, Enterprise or any of its successors and
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and
assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Enterprise shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.11.

(e) These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party. After the
Effective Time, the obligations of Enterprise under this Section 5.11 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification. If any Indemnified Party makes
any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section
5.11 that is denied by Enterprise, and a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or
advancement of expense, in whole or in part, then Enterprise or the Surviving Entity shall pay such Indemnified Party's costs and expenses,
including legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with enforcing such
claim against Enterprise.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.11 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring EBandT to
indemnify, hold harmless, release, guarantee the obligations of, or purchase
or acquire assets or liabilities of, Enterprise or any Affiliate of
Enterprise.

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Seacoast Bank to
indemnify, hold harmless, release, guarantee the obligations of, or purchase
or acquire assets or liabilities of, Seacoast or any Affiliate of Seacoast.

Section 5.12 Employees; Benefit Plans.

(a) With respect to any Enterprise Benefit Plan in which any employee of
Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary on the Closing Date (the "Continuing
Employees") will participate, Enterprise shall, or shall cause Seacoast to,
recognize, for vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual purposes (other than
benefit accruals under a defined pension plan), all service of the Continuing
Employees with Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary (including any predecessors
thereof) as if such service were with Enterprise; provided, however, such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that (i) such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits or (ii) such service was not recognized
under the corresponding Seacoast Benefit Plan.

(b) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, Enterprise shall maintain the terms and
conditions of employment of each Continuing Employee on terms and conditions
that are no less favorable to each Continuing Employee than the terms and
conditions of employment of such Continuing Employee provided by Seacoast or
any Seacoast Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing, including terms
relating to salary, incentive compensation opportunities, and severance
benefits, medical benefits, other welfare benefits, fringe benefits, work
location and position.

(c) Enterprise shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i) waive or cause
to be waived any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or
pre-existing condition limitations and similar limitations with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees
and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with full credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such group health plan.

(d) Enterprise shall provide, or shall cause the EBandT to provide, severance
benefits to any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated following
the Closing Date with severance benefits that are at least as favorable as those that
would have been payable to a similarly situated employee of Enterprise.

(e) This Section 5.12 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.12,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.12. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend
or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 5.12
shall not create any right in any employee or any other Person to any
continued employment with Seacoast or its Subsidiaries, Enterprise or any of
their respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever.

Section 5.13 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b). Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Enterprise and Seacoast shall take all steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to exempt the conversion of shares of Seacoast Common
Stock into shares of Enterprise Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement by employees and directors of Seacoast who may become an officer or
director of Enterprise subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act.

Section 5.14 Notification of Certain Changes. Enterprise and Seacoast shall
promptly advise the other party of any change or event (a) having, or which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) which it
believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its or its Subsidiary bank's representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein, which breach could reasonably be
expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a
condition in Article 6 to be satisfied on the Closing Date, provided, that any
failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any
change or event shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section
5.14, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing
to give such notice, in each case, unless the underlying change or event would
independently result in a failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.02 or Section 6.03 to be satisfied on the Closing Date.

Section 5.15 Transition; Informational Systems Conversion. From and after the
date hereof, each of Enterprise and Seacoast shall use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to facilitate the integration of Seacoast and Seacoast
Subsidiaries with the business of Enterprise and Enterprise Subsidiaries
following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall meet
on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the data
processing and related electronic informational systems of Seacoast and
Seacoast Subsidiaries (the "Informational Systems Conversion") in such a
manner reasonably sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that a
successful Informational Systems Conversion will occur. The Informational
Systems Conversion will occur, at such date as may be specified by Enterprise,
subject to any applicable Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of
information and other Laws regarding competition. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Seacoast shall, subject to any such applicable
Laws: (i) reasonably cooperate with Enterprise to establish a project plan as
specified by Enterprise to effectuate the Informational Systems Conversion;
(ii) use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to have Seacoast's outside contractors continue to support
both the Informational Systems Conversion effort and its ongoing needs until
the Informational Systems Conversion can be established; (iii) provide, or use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain from any outside contractors, all
data or other files and layouts reasonably requested by Enterprise for use in
planning the Informational Systems Conversion, as soon as reasonably
practicable; (iv) provide reasonable access to Seacoast's personnel and
facilities and its outside contractors' personnel and facilities, to the
extent necessary to enable the Informational Systems Conversion effort to be
completed on schedule; and (v) give notice of termination, conditioned upon
the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, of the
Contracts of outside data, item and other processing contractors or other
third-party vendors to which Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary is bound, if
requested to do so by Enterprise, to the extent permitted by such Contracts;
provided, that Seacoast shall not be required to take any action under this
Section 5.15 that, after consultation with Enterprise regarding Seacoast's
concerns in the matter, is reasonably likely to prejudice or adversely affect
in any material respect its rights under any such Contracts in the event the
Closing does not occur. Seacoast shall pay any reasonable out of pocket
expenses due third parties incurred in connection with the actions described
in this Section 5.15. Such access as contemplated by this Section 5.15 shall
be conducted by Enterprise in a manner which does not adversely affect the
normal operations of Seacoast or Seacoast Bank and neither Seacoast nor
Seacoast Bank shall be required to provide access to or disclose information
(i) which would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of Seacoast or
Seacoast Bank or contravene any binding Contract entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement or any Law, Order or fiduciary duty, (ii) except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, relating to an Acquisition Proposal, a
Superior Proposal, a Seacoast Subsequent Determination or any matters related
thereto, or (iii) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, related to
Seacoast's or Seacoast Bank's directors', officers', employees', accountants',
counsels', advisors' (including investment bankers), agents', or other
representatives', consideration of, or deliberations regarding, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.16 No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Enterprise, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of Seacoast or Seacoast Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Seacoast,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of
Enterprise or Enterprise Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, each of Seacoast and Enterprise shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, control and supervision over
its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

Section 5.17 Environmental Matters.

(a) Phase I Assessments. For any Seacoast Owned Property, any Seacoast OREO
Property and any Seacoast Leased Property which is identified by Enterprise
within fifteen (15) days following the date of this Agreement, Enterprise may,
at its sole cost and expense, obtain, within sixty (60) days after the date of
such notice, written reports of a Phase I ESA for each such property, prepared
by an environmental consultant experienced in performing Phase I ESAs of real
property ("Environmental Consultant") and acceptable to Seacoast. Each Phase I ESA shall be delivered in counterparts to Enterprise and Seacoast. The
Environmental Consultant will include customary language allowing both
Enterprise and Seacoast to rely upon its findings and conclusions. The
Environmental Consultant will provide a draft of any Phase I ESA to Seacoast
and Enterprise for review and comment prior to the finalization of such
report. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in this Section,
neither Enterprise nor the Environmental Consultant will conduct or cause to
be conducted any invasive, intrusive or destructive inspections or other
sampling or testing on the Seacoast Owned Property or Seacoast Leased
Property, including, without limitation, of the air, soil, soil gas, vapors,
surface water, groundwater, building materials or other environmental media,
thereon.

(b) Phase II Assessments. In the event any Phase I ESA (including a Phase I
ESA that Seacoast or any Seacoast Subsidiary caused to be performed within one
(1) year prior to the date of this Agreement) discloses that such property may
be impacted or have its use restricted by any Recognized Environmental
Condition or Historical Recognized Environmental Condition (as each term is
defined by ASTM E1527-13) or by any PFAS for which Enterprise or Enterprise
Subsidiaries would be liable and that, in the good faith reasonable belief of
Enterprise, would result in a material liability to Seacoast or any Seacoast
Subsidiary following the Effective Time and as such warrants further review or
investigation, Enterprise shall reasonably promptly give notice of the same (a
"Phase I Notice") to Seacoast no later than five (5) Business Days following
Enterprise's receipt of the relevant Phase I ESA. Seacoast may then, in its
sole and absolute discretion and without any obligation whatsoever to do so,
within an additional twenty (20) day period, retain the Environmental
Consultant to conduct a Phase II environmental site assessment in accordance
with ASTM Standard E1903-11 ("Phase II ESA") of the relevant property or
facility; provided, however, that such Phase II ESA shall be completed, and a
written report of the Phase II ESA prepared, no later than sixty (60) days
after Seacoast receives from Enterprise the Phase I Notice for the relevant
property; and provided further, that with respect to any Seacoast Leased
Property, Seacoast will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the
relevant property owner's consent for such Phase II ESA. Enterprise
acknowledges and understands that such consent may not be able to be obtained.
The scope of the Phase II ESA shall be mutually determined by Enterprise and
Seacoast in their reasonable discretion after consultation with the other
party, and all reasonable costs and expenses associated with such Phase II ESA
testing and report shall be borne by Enterprise. Seacoast shall provide copies
of the draft and final Phase II ESA reports, if any, to Enterprise promptly
following the receipt of any such report by Seacoast.

(c) Cooperation. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.17 to the
contrary, Seacoast shall keep Enterprise reasonably apprised of all activities
and actions contemplated by this Section 5.17, and Seacoast and Enterprise
shall cooperate fully with one another with respect to the matters required by
this Section 5.17.

Section 5.18 Certain Litigation. Seacoast shall promptly advise Enterprise
orally and in writing of any actual or threatened Legal Proceeding against
Seacoast and/or the members of the Seacoast Board related to this Agreement or
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seacoast
shall: (i) permit Enterprise to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of Enterprise in connection with, any proposed written or response to such Legal Proceeding; (ii) furnish Enterprise's outside legal
counsel with all non-privileged information and documents which outside
counsel may reasonably request in connection with such Legal Proceeding; (iii)
consult with Enterprise regarding the defense or settlement of any such Legal
Proceeding, give due consideration to Enterprise's advice with respect to such
Legal Proceeding and not settle any such Legal Proceeding prior to such
consultation and consideration; provided, however, that Seacoast shall not
settle any such Legal Proceeding if such settlement requires the payment of
money damages, without the written consent of Enterprise (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the payment of any such damages by
Seacoast is reasonably expected by Seacoast, following consultation with
outside counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any deductible to be paid
by Seacoast) under Seacoast's existing director and officer insurance
policies, including any tail policy.

Section 5.19 Director Matters; Board Packages. Seacoast shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to cause to be delivered to Enterprise resignations of all
the directors of Seacoast and Seacoast Subsidiaries, such resignations to be
effective as of the Effective Time. Seacoast shall distribute by electronic
email or otherwise make available a copy of any Seacoast or Seacoast Bank
board package, including the agenda, any draft minutes and any reports
(including any internal management financial control reports showing actual
financial performance against plan and previous period, and reports relating
to financial performance and risk management), to Enterprise as soon as
practicable after the time in which it distributes a copy of such package to
the Seacoast Board and board of directors of Seacoast Bank, as the case may be
(and in any event at least two Business Days prior to the board meeting for
which the board package relates); provided, however, that Seacoast shall not
be required to disclose to Enterprise any documents (a) which would jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege of Seacoast or Seacoast Bank or contravene any
binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or any Law,
Order or fiduciary duty, (b) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Seacoast
Subsequent Determination or any matters related thereto, or (c) except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, related Seacoast's or Seacoast Bank's

consideration of, or deliberations regarding, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

shall meet from time to time as Enterprise may reasonably request, not less
frequently than monthly, to prepare the parties for integration of the
operations of Seacoast and Seacoast Bank with Enterprise and EBandT and to
review the financial and operational affairs of Seacoast and Seacoast
Subsidiaries, and Seacoast shall give due consideration to Enterprise's input
on such matters, with the understanding that, notwithstanding any other
provision contained in this Agreement, neither Enterprise nor EBandT shall,
under any circumstance, be permitted to exercise control of Seacoast or any
Seacoast Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time. Seacoast shall permit
representatives of Enterprise to be onsite at Seacoast to facilitate
integration of operations and assist with any other coordination efforts as (b) Seacoast shall, consistent with GAAP and regulatory accounting principles,
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to adjust, at Enterprise's reasonable
request, internal control procedures which are consistent with Enterprise's
and EBandT's current internal control procedures to allow Enterprise to fulfill
its reporting requirement under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
provided, however, that no such adjustments need be made prior to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01(a) and Section

facilitating the integration of Seacoast and its business into that of

request of the other party, introduce the other party and its representatives
to its customers and those of its Subsidiaries for the purpose of facilitating
the integration of Seacoast and its business into that of Enterprise. Any
interaction between Enterprise and Seacoast and any of their Subsidiaries'
customers and suppliers shall be coordinated by the parties and no
discussions, meetings or communications between a party's customers and
suppliers shall occur without the presence of a representative of, or the
prior written approval of, such party.

(e) Seacoast Bank shall execute such certificates or articles of combination
and such other documents and certificates as may be requested by Enterprise to
effectuate the Bank Merger.

ARTICLE 7

TERMINATION



Section 7.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned:

(a) Mutual Consent. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual
consent, in writing, of Enterprise and Seacoast.

(b) No Regulatory Approval. By Enterprise or Seacoast in the event any Closing
Regulatory Approval (i) shall have been denied by final, non-appealable action
by the applicable Governmental Authority or an application therefor shall have
been withdrawn at the request of the applicable Governmental Authority, (ii)
any Closing Regulatory Approval includes a Burdensome Condition, or (iii) any
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority shall have
issued an order, decree, ruling or taken any other action restraining or
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become
final and non-appealable; provided, however, that no party shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b) if such
denial shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants of such party set forth in this
Agreement.

(c) Reduced Valuation. By Seacoast by delivering written notice to Enterprise
at any time during the five (5) Trading Day period commencing on the
Determination Date if both of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the
Average VWAP as of the Trading Day immediately preceding Determination Date is
less than 0.80 of the Initial VWAP (such Average VWAP, the "Triggering VWAP");
and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the Triggering VWAP by the Initial
VWAP (rounding to four decimal places) is less than the quotient obtained by
dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index Price (rounded to four
decimal places) (such quotient, the "Index Ratio"), and then subtracting 0.20
from the Index Ratio; provided, however, that if Seacoast elects to terminate
pursuant to this Section 7.01(c) and provides such written notice to
Enterprise, then within two (2) Business Days following Enterprise's receipt
of such notice, Enterprise may elect by written notice to Seacoast to
reinstate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and adjust the Exchange Ratio to equal a number equal to the lesser of (1) a
quotient (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth), the numerator of which is
$12.4355 and the denominator of which is the Triggering VWAP and (2) a
quotient (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth), the numerator of which is
$12.4355 and the denominator of which is the Triggering VWAP, and then
multiplying such quotient by the Index Ratio. An example of the calculations
used to determine whether the two conditions set forth in clauses (i)-(ii) above have been satisfied is set forth in Schedule 3. If
Enterprise makes such election to reinstate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, no termination will occur
pursuant to this Section 7.01(c) and this Agreement will remain in effect
according to its terms (except as the Merger Consideration has been adjusted).
If Enterprise, during such time as it belongs to the Index, declares or
effects a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or
similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Enterprise Common Stock,
and the record date therefor shall be after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Determination Date, the prices for the Enterprise Common Stock
shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted for the purpose of
applying this Section 7.01(c).

(d) No Shareholder Approval. By either Enterprise or Seacoast (provided, in
the case of Seacoast, that it shall not be in breach of any of its obligations
under Section 5.04), if the Requisite Seacoast Shareholder Approval shall not
have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the Requisite Seacoast
Shareholder Approval at the Seacoast Meeting.

(e) Breach of Representations and Warranties.

(i) By Enterprise (provided, that neither Enterprise nor EBandT is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained herein such that Seacoast would be entitled not to

by Enterprise pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(i) or Section 7.01(f)(i), and (b)
prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination, Seacoast enters into any agreement to consummate, or consummates

of Seacoast's or Seacoast Bank's material breach of the provisions of this
Agreement contemplated by Section 7.01(e)(i) or Section 7.01(f)(i) that is not
timely cured as provided in such sections, the actual damages sustained by
Enterprise, including the expenses incurred by Enterprise preparatory to
entering into this Agreement and in connection with the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement, would be significant and difficult to
ascertain, gauged by the circumstances existing at the time this Agreement is
executed, and that in lieu of Enterprise being required to pursue its damage
claims in costly litigation proceedings in such event, the parties agree that
Seacoast shall pay a reasonable estimate of the amount of such damages, which
the parties agree is the sum of $1,250,000 (the "Liquidated Damages Payment"),
as liquidated damages to Enterprise, which payment is not intended as a
penalty, within two (2) Business Days after Enterprise's notification of such
termination. Any payment made under this Section 7.01(b) shall reduce on a
dollar-for-dollar basis any payment that may be due under Section 7.01(a).

(c) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that if Seacoast terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(ii) or Section 7.01(f)(ii) by reason of
Enterprise's or EBandT's material breach of the provisions of this Agreement contemplated by
Section 7.01(e)(ii) or Section 7.01(f)(ii) that is not timely cured as
provided in such sections, the actual damages sustained by Seacoast, including
the expenses incurred by Seacoast preparatory to entering into this Agreement
and in connection with the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, would be significant and difficult to ascertain, gauged by the
circumstances existing at the time this Agreement is executed, and that in
lieu of Seacoast being required to pursue its damage claims in costly
litigation proceedings in such event, the parties agree that Enterprise shall
pay $1,250,000, which the parties agree is the Liquidated Damages Payment, as
liquidated damages to Seacoast, which payment is not intended as a penalty,
within two (2) Business Days after Seacoast's notification of such
termination.

(d) Seacoast and Enterprise each agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay any amounts
due under this Section 7.02, such party shall pay interest on such amounts
from the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment
at the rate of interest equal to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published
from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any
successor publication thereto), designated therein as the prime rate on the
date such payment was due, plus (ii) 200 basis points, together with the costs
and expenses of the other party (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
reasonably incurred in connection with such suit.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that if Seacoast pays or causes to be paid to Enterprise the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), or, if applicable, the
Liquidated Damages Payment in accordance with Section 7.02(b), none of
Seacoast, Seacoast Bank, or any successor in interest, Affiliate, shareholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of Seacoast
or Seacoast Bank, will have any further obligations or liabilities to
Enterprise or EBandT with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of such amounts shall be
Enterprise's sole and exclusive remedy against Seacoast, Seacoast Bank and
their respective Affiliates, representatives or successors in interest. For
the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the fee payable under Section
7.02(a) shall not be required to be paid more than once. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree that
if Enterprise pays or causes to be paid to Seacoast the Liquidated Damages
Payment in accordance with Section 7.02(c), none of Enterprise, EBandT, or any
successor in interest, Affiliate, shareholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of Enterprise or EBandT, will have any
further obligations or liabilities to Seacoast with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of such
amounts shall be Seacoast's sole and exclusive remedy against Enterprise, EBandT
and their respective Affiliates, representatives or successors in interest.

Section 7.03 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 7.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party (or any shareholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party or any of its Affiliates) to
the other party hereto, except as provided in Section 7.02(d); provided, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit either party's rights to
recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the other party's willful
breach of any provision of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 7.03
and Section 5.21, Section 7.02, Section 9.03 and Section 9.04 shall survive
any termination hereof pursuant to Section 7.01.

reference to the other section or subsection is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure. The mere inclusion of an item in either the Seacoast
Disclosure Schedule or the Enterprise Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation, warranty or covenant shall not be deemed to be an admission or
evidence that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

provision of this Agreement, no disclosure, representation or warranty shall

or in damages. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that Enterprise shall be
entitled to seek an injunction to prevent a breach of this Agreement and to
seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which Enterprise is entitled at law or in equity.

requirement for the securing or posting of a bond in connection with
Enterprise seeking or obtaining such injunctive relief.

Form of Spousal Consent

I, [●], [spouse/domestic partner] of [●], acknowledge that I have read the
Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and among [●]
("Shareholder"), shareholder of Seacoast Commerce Banc Holdings ("Seacoast"),
a California corporation, and Enterprise Financial Services Corp, a Delaware
corporation, to which this Spousal Consent (this "Consent") is attached as
Exhibit A (as the same may be amended or amended and restated from time to
time, the "Agreement"), and that I understand the contents of the Agreement. I
am aware that my [spouse/domestic partner] is a party to the Agreement and the
Agreement contains provisions regarding the voting of Shares (as defined in
the Agreement) of Seacoast which my [spouse/domestic partner] may own,
including any interest I might have therein.

I hereby consent to the execution by my [spouse/domestic partner] of the
Agreement and agree that I and any interest, including any community property
interest, that I may have in any Shares of Seacoast subject to the Agreement
shall be irrevocably bound by the Agreement including any voting or other
obligations as set forth in the Agreement. I hereby irrevocably appoint my
[spouse/domestic partner] as my attorney-in-fact and agent with respect to the
exercise of any rights and obligations under the Agreement.

I agree that, in the event of divorce or the dissolution of my
[marriage/partnership] to my present [spouse/domestic partner] or other legal
division of property, I will transfer and sell, at the fair market value, to
my [spouse/domestic partner] any and all interest I have or may acquire in
Seacoast, and I further agree that a court may award such entire interest to
my [spouse/domestic partner] as part of any such legal division of property.
The foregoing agreement is not intended as a waiver of any community property
or other ownership interest I may have in the Shares of Seacoast, but only as
an agreement to accept other property or assets of substantially equivalent
value as part of any property settlement agreement or other legal division of
property upon divorce or the dissolution of my [marriage/partnership].

I agree not to directly or indirectly, transfer, sell, offer, exchange,
assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber ("Transfer") any interest I
may have in the Shares of Seacoast or enter into any contract, option or other
agreement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of, any interest I may
have in the Shares of Seacoast, unless in connection with the above paragraph.

I agree not to bequeath my interest, if any, in the Shares of Seacoast, by
will, trust, or any other testamentary disposition to any person other than my
current [spouse/domestic partner]. Further, the residuary clause in my will
shall not include my interest, if any, in the Shares of Seacoast.

This Consent shall be binding on my executors, administrators, heirs, and
assigns. I agree to execute and deliver such documents as may be necessary to
carry out the intent of the Agreement and this Consent.

I am aware that the legal, financial, and related matters contained in the
Agreement are complex and that I am free to seek independent professional
guidance or counsel with respect to this Consent. I have either sought such
guidance or counsel or determined after reviewing the Agreement carefully that
I will waive such right. I am under no disability or impairment that affects
my decision to sign this Consent and I knowingly and voluntarily intend to be bound by this Consent. I consent to the delivery and transmission of this
Consent (and the Voting Agreement, as applicable) by facsimile, by electronic
mail, or by other electronic transmission, and to the use of portable document
format (.pdf) or other electronic or facsimile format for this Consent and the
Voting Agreement (as applicable). I agree that I will be legally bound by my
Electronic Signature to this Consent (as such term is defined immediately
below), and that my Electronic Signature shall be the legal equivalent of my
manual signature. The term "Electronic Signature" means (a) my manual
signature on this Consent, converted to facsimile or other digital form (such
as a .pdf file) and sent from my customary email address, customary facsimile
number, or other authenticated source mutually agreed-upon by me and my
[spouse/domestic partner] or the designee of my [spouse/domestic partner]; or
(b) my digital signature executed using the process provided by DocuSign Inc.

I am satisfied with the terms of this Consent and I understand and have
received full disclosure of all the rights that I am agreeing to waive.

I hereby agree that my [spouse/domestic partner] may join in any future
amendment, waiver, consent, or modification of the Agreement without any
further signature, acknowledgment, agreement, or consent on my part or notice
