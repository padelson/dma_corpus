 2.3 _Determination of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be determined following the Closing Date as follows: 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event more than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Wells Fargo shall deliver to Purchaser a balance sheet of the Island Finance Business as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Island Finance Business in conformity with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the December Balance Sheet. During the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and through the date of the final determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.3(b) or (c), Purchaser shall cooperate fully with Wells Fargo in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet. 

  

 (b) Purchaser may dispute any item reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet that impacts the calculation of the Purchase Price by notifying Wells Fargo in writing within thirty (30) days after the date on which Purchaser has received the Closing Balance Sheet. If Purchaser does not so notify Wells Fargo within such period, the Closing Balance Sheet shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties for purposes of calculating the Purchase Price. If Purchaser does so notify Wells Fargo, Purchaser and Wells Fargo shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and any written resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. 

  

 (c) If Purchaser and Wells Fargo are unable to reach a resolution with respect to all of the items specified in the notice referred to in Section 2.3(b) within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt by Wells Fargo of such notice, then either Purchaser or Wells Fargo may submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Wells Fargo (the "Independent Accountants"), which shall, within thirty (30) days after such submission or such longer period as the Independent Accountants may require, determine and report to Wells Fargo and Purchaser upon such remaining disputed items, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the aggregate amount in dispute is less than the Independent Accountants estimate of the amount of their fees and disbursements in connection with the resolution of such dispute, then such dispute shall not be submitted to the Independent Accountants and the Purchase Price shall be conclusively deemed to equal the quotient of (x) the 

   ##### 

  

    

sum of (i) the Purchase Price proposed by Wells Fargo and (ii) the Purchase
Price proposed by Purchaser, divided by (y) two (2). The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accountants shall be borne by each of
Purchaser and Wells Fargo, respectively, in accordance with the
proportions derived from the following formula: 

  

 _Purchase Price Submitted  Purchase Price Determined by
Independent Accountants _ 

  

 Purchase Price Submitted  Purchase Price Submitted by Other Party 

  

By way of illustration, if Wells Fargo submits to the Independent Accountants
that the Purchase Price should equal US$700 million, Purchaser submits that
the Purchase Price should equal US$680 million, and the Independent
Accountants determine that the Purchase Price equals US$693 million, then
Wells Fargo would bear 35% and Purchaser would bear 65% of the fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accountants. 

  

 2.4 _Settlement of Purchase Price_. If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3(b) or (c) exceeds the Closing Payment, Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days after such final determination, pay such excess to the Seller(s) designated by Wells Fargo. If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.3(b) or (c) is less than the Closing Payment, Wells Fargo shall, within five (5) Business Days after such final determination, pay such difference to Purchaser. The party making such payment shall pay interest thereon to the other party for the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the annual rate announced from time to time as the rate charged to a member bank by the Federal Reserve on overnight loans. Payment of such excess (or difference) and interest thereon shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account or accounts as Wells Fargo or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall designate in writing to the other. 

  

 2.5 _Contracts Not Transferable_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a transfer or assignment of (or agreement to transfer or assign) any Contract if a transfer or assignment (or attempted transfer or assignment), without the consent or waiver of any person or entity, would constitute a breach thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of Purchaser or either Seller thereunder. The Sellers and Purchaser shall use their respective best efforts to obtain any consent or waiver required to assign to Purchaser all rights, benefits and interests under each Contract being assumed by Purchaser (or make available to Purchaser the practical benefit thereof) in a manner to permit the Island Finance Business to be conducted in all material respects as currently conducted following the Closing Date. 

  

 2.6 _Limited Power of Attorney_. Contingent upon and effective as of the Closing, the Sellers appoint Purchaser, its agents, employees, successors and assigns, as their attorney-in-fact, which such appointment is coupled with an interest, with full power of revocation and substitution by Purchaser, in the name and stead of each Seller, but on behalf of Purchaser or its assignees, to do any of the following with respect to the Receivables included in the Purchased Assets: (a) receive, endorse and collect all payments, checks, money orders, drafts or other instruments or documents made payable to or owed to either Seller in connection with such Receivables; (b) execute on behalf of either Seller, or enforce, release, modify and transfer 

   ##### 

  

    

the rights, privileges and interests (including security interests and real
estate mortgages) of either Seller with respect to such Receivables,
including any claims thereunder and certificates of title or other title
documents or security documents; (c) enforce and exercise any rights
and remedies of either Seller with respect to such Receivables; and (d)
demand, collect and receive any and all such Receivables. On the Closing Date
and from time-to-time thereafter, the Sellers will execute such limited

 2.7 _Excess Loan Loss Adjustment_  

  

 (a) In the event that the aggregate amount of Actual Loan Losses incurred by Purchaser, net of Recoveries, exceed Thirty-Four Million United States Dollars (US$34,000,000.00) (the "Loss Reimbursement Threshold") prior to the 15 Month Anniversary, Wells Fargo shall reimburse (or shall cause its Affiliates to reimburse) Purchaser for the amount of subsequent Actual Loan Losses in respect of Eligible Receivables, net of Recoveries (such subsequent Actual Loan Losses in respect of Eligible Receivables, net of Recoveries, hereinafter "Excess Eligible Receivable Losses") up to the amount of Twenty-One Million United States Dollars (US$21,000,000.00) (the "Maximum Reimbursement Amount") for Excess Eligible Receivable Losses occurring on or prior to the 15 Month Anniversary; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the amount of Excess Eligible Receivable Losses has not reached the Maximum Reimbursement Amount by the 15 Month Anniversary, then Wells Fargo shall further reimburse (or shall cause its Affiliates to further reimburse) Purchaser for any Excess Eligible Receivable Losses that occur after the 15 Month Anniversary but prior to the 18 Month Anniversary, up to the amount of Seven Million United States Dollars (US$7,000,000.00) (the "Secondary Maximum Amount"), but in no event will the aggregate amount of Excess Eligible Receivable Losses for which Wells Fargo or its Affiliates are required to reimburse Purchaser exceed the Maximum Reimbursement Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wells Fargo and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to reimburse Purchaser for any Excess Eligible Receivable Losses incurred after the date on which the Servicing Management Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms thereof. 

  

 (b) Reimbursement payments required pursuant to Section 2.7(a) shall be made on a monthly basis within fifteen (15) days following the end of each applicable calendar month, beginning after the calendar month end at which the aggregate amount of Actual Loan Losses, net of Recoveries, first exceed the Loss Reimbursement Threshold. Monthly reimbursement payments pursuant to Section 2.7 shall cease upon the earliest to occur of (i) the reimbursement payment that reaches either the Maximum Reimbursement Amount or the Secondary Maximum Amount, (ii) the reimbursement payment, if any, following the calendar month in which the Servicing Management Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms thereof, or (iii) the reimbursement payment, if any, following the calendar month in which the 18 Month Anniversary occurs.

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant to this Section 2.7 to exceed the Maximum Reimbursement Amount shall
be reduced such that the aggregate sum (including such payment) of all
reimbursement payments pursuant to this Section 2.7 shall equal the Maximum
Reimbursement Amount, and (B) any monthly reimbursement payment that would
cause the aggregate sum (including such payment) of all reimbursement payments
pursuant to this Section 2.7 related to Excess Eligible Receivable Losses
incurred after the 15 Month Anniversary to exceed the Secondary Maximum
Amount shall be reduced such that the aggregate sum (including such payment)
of all reimbursement payments pursuant to this Section 2.7 related to Excess
Eligible Receivable Losses incurred after the 15 Month Anniversary shall equal
the Secondary Maximum Amount. 

  

 (c) _Reserved_. 

  

 (d) Until the expiration of Wells Fargos reimbursement obligation pursuant to this Section 2.7, Purchaser agrees to provide Wells Fargo (or such Affiliate as Wells Fargo directs), no less than monthly, a list and description of all Receivables included in the Purchased Assets that are charged off after the Closing Date and a list of all Recoveries.

ARTICLE X 
 INDEMNIFICATION BY WELLS FARGO 

   

 10.1 _Indemnification_. In addition to and not in limitation of the indemnities provided in Section 7.11(b) (which Section sets forth the exclusive remedy of Purchaser in respect of the matters covered thereby), from and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this Article X, Wells Fargo agrees to indemnify Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors and employees (collectively, the "Indemnified Purchaser Entities") and to hold each of them harmless from and against, and agrees to assume liability for, any and all Proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments, claims, liabilities, losses, costs, damages or expenses, including interest, penalties, and reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and disbursements in connection with any Proceeding against such person or entity (but excluding loss of profits or other consequential damages and net of any Tax benefit) (collectively, "Damages"), suffered, paid or incurred by such Indemnified Purchaser Entity resulting from, caused by, or in connection with: (a) any breach of any of the representations and warranties made by Wells Fargo and Sellers to Purchaser in this Agreement (provided, that, for purposes of this Section 10.1(a), the determination of whether such breach has occurred will disregard (i) "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers and (ii) "knowledge" qualifiers, other than those involving knowledge of acts, activities or omissions or contemplated or threatened acts, activities or omissions of third parties (including, without limitation, Governmental Authorities); (b) any breach by Wells Fargo or the Sellers of any covenant or agreement of Wells Fargo or the Sellers contained in this Agreement; or (c) any of the Excluded Liabilities, including but not limited to all Liabilities related to the pending Proceedings described in Sections 4.8 and 4.15 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedules. 

  

 10.2 _Indemnification Procedures, Etc_. 

  

 (a) If an Indemnified Purchaser Entity believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this Article X (whether or not the amount of Damages relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified Purchaser Entity shall promptly assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice thereof (a "Claim Notice") to Wells Fargo. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim in reasonable detail. The failure to so notify Wells Fargo shall not relieve Wells Fargo of any obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Purchaser Entity unless (and then only to the extent that) such failure shall have adversely affected Wells Fargos ability to defend against, settle or satisfy any claim to which the Claim Notice relates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to claims for indemnification that do not involve a third-party claim (defined below), the Indemnified Purchaser Entities shall not deliver a Claim Notice with respect to any such claims unless the aggregate amount of Damages for all claims included within such Claim Notice exceeds One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($100,000.00). Wells 

   ##### 

  

    

Fargo shall not assert that any delay in delivering a Claim Notice resulting
from the Indemnified Purchaser Entities compliance with the foregoing
sentence has adversely affected Wells Fargos ability to defend against,
settle or satisfy the claims for indemnification specified therein. 

  

 (b) If any claim or demand by an Indemnified Purchaser Entity under this Article X relates to an action or claim filed or made against an Indemnified Purchaser Entity by a third party (a "third-party claim"), Wells Fargo will have the right to defend such Indemnified Purchaser Entity against the third-party claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Purchaser Entity so long as (i) Wells Fargo advises the Indemnified Purchaser Entity in writing of its election to assume such defense within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of the Claim Notice with respect to such third-party claim (provided, that if the Claim Notice specifies that it relates to a labor claim subject to summary proceedings legislation, Wells Fargo must advise the Indemnified Purchaser Entity in writing of its election to assume such defense within five (5) Business Days), (ii) the third-party claim involves money damages only and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief (or the Indemnified Purchaser Entity consents in writing to Wells Fargo assuming such defense notwithstanding the fact that the third-party claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief) and (iii) Wells Fargo conducts the defense of the third-party claim actively and diligently. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.2: (i) an Indemnified Purchaser Entity will be entitled to participate in the defense of any third-party claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose at its own sole cost and expense; and (ii) an Indemnified Purchaser Entity will be entitled to assume control of the defense of such third-party claim and Wells Fargo will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of a single counsel retained by such Indemnified Purchaser Entity (excluding the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Purchaser Entitys counsel incurred prior to the date of such assumption of the defense), if: (A) the Indemnified Purchaser Entity reasonably concludes that such third-party claim could reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the business or reputation of Santander; (B) the Indemnified Purchaser Entity reasonably concludes that there exists a conflict of interest that, under applicable principles of legal ethics, would prohibit a single legal counsel from representing both the Indemnified Purchaser Entity and Wells Fargo in such third-party claim, and such conflict has not been timely waived; (C) the Indemnified Purchaser Entity reasonably concludes that there are significant and colorable legal defenses available to it that are inconsistent with those defenses available to Wells Fargo; (D) such third-party claim could involve the imposition of criminal penalties upon the Indemnified Purchaser Entity; or (E) Wells Fargo either (1) has failed to give a notice of defense under Section 10.2(b)(i) and timely assume the defense of such third-party claim or (2) is failing to conduct the defense of such third-party claim actively and diligently. In the event that an Indemnified Purchaser Entity assumes the defense of a third-party claim in accordance with the preceding sentence, (x) Wells Fargo will reimburse the Indemnified Purchaser Entity promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the third-party claim (including reasonable fees and expenses of a single counsel), and (y) Wells Fargo will remain responsible for any Damages the Indemnified Purchaser Entity may suffer resulting from, caused by, or in connection with the third-party claim to the fullest extent provided in this Article X. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) So long as Wells Fargo is conducting the defense of the third-party claim in accordance with Section 10.2(b) or an Indemnified Purchaser Entity is conducting the defense pursuant to any of Sections 10.2(c)(ii)(A) through 10.2(c)(ii)(D), (i) the Indemnified Purchaser Entity will not consent to the entry of any judgment on, or enter into any settlement with respect to, the third-party claim without the prior written consent of Wells Fargo, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) Wells Fargo will not consent to the entry of any judgment on, or enter into any settlement with respect to, the third-party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Purchaser Entity, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless such judgment or settlement involves only the payment of money damages by Wells Fargo and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Purchaser Entity. In the event that an Indemnified Purchaser Entity assumes control of the defense of a third-party claim pursuant to Section 10.2(c)(ii)(E), the Indemnified Purchaser Entity may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, a third-party claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Purchaser Entity need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, Wells Fargo in connection therewith); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such judgment or settlement shall impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon Wells Fargo or any of its Affiliates unless Wells Fargo has consented thereto in advance in writing. 

  

 (e) If Wells Fargo elects to defend any such third-party claim, then each Indemnified Purchaser Entity shall make available to Wells Fargo all information reasonably available to such Indemnified Purchaser Entity relating to such third-party claim. In addition, the parties hereto shall render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such third-party claim. The party in charge of the defense shall keep the other party fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. 

  

 10.3 _Limitation on Liability_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article X, the Indemnified Purchaser Entities shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article X, with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(a): 

   

 (i) until the earlier to occur of (A) the first anniversary of the Closing Date ("First Anniversary Date") or (B) the date on which the aggregate Damages to all Indemnified Purchaser Entities (without duplication), with respect to all claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(a) ("Aggregate Purchaser Damages"), exceed Three Million United States Dollars (US$3,000,000.00) (the "Threshold Amount"), whereupon (subject to the provisions of clause (iv) below) Wells Fargo shall be obligated to pay in full all such amounts (including all amounts comprising the Threshold Amount or such lesser amount of Aggregate Purchaser Damages payable on the First Anniversary Date, which lesser amount shall be the "Seller First Anniversary Payment Amount"); _provided_ that in the event that the Threshold Amount has not been reached by the First Anniversary Date, Wells Fargo shall be obligated to pay all amounts in excess of the Seller First Anniversary Payment Amount with respect to Aggregate Purchaser 

   ##### 

  

    

Damages on the earlier to occur of (A) the date on which the Threshold
Amount is reached or (B) the second anniversary of the Closing Date; 

   

 (ii) with respect to any claim for indemnification based upon (x) a breach of any representation and warranty made by Wells Fargo and the Sellers to Purchaser in this Agreement (other than those in Sections 4.2, 4.5 (for which a claim for indemnification may be made without any limitation on time), 4.13 and 4.18), the Claim Notice with respect to which is not received on or before the date that is two years after the Closing Date, or (y) a breach of any representation and warranty made by Wells Fargo to Purchaser in Sections 4.13 or 4.18 of this Agreement, the Claim Notice with respect to which is not received on or before the date that is sixty (60) days following (1) the date of expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the matters to which such claim relates (assuming no waiver or extension thereof effected in accordance with clause (2) below), or (2) if Purchaser waives or extends the applicable statute of limitations with the prior consent of the Wells Fargo, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the date of final settlement of such open tax period or the end of such extension, as the case may be; 

   

 (iii) for Damages to the extent such Damages are incurred based on or in respect of any activities of Purchaser or its Affiliates from and after the Closing Date; or 

   

 (iv) for aggregate Damages in excess of (x) One Hundred Thirty-Seven Million United States Dollars (US$137,000,000.00) with respect to all claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(a) (other than those based upon a breach of the representations and warranties made by Wells Fargo and the Sellers to Purchaser in Sections 4.5 or 4.17), or (y) the amount of the Purchase Price with respect to all claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(a) that are based upon a breach of the representations and warranties made by Wells Fargo and the Sellers to Purchaser in Sections 4.5 or 4.17. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Article IV or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser understands and agrees that Wells Fargo and the Sellers are not making any representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, other than those representations and warranties of Wells Fargo and the Sellers expressly set forth in Article IV (including, and as qualified or modified by, the Sellers Disclosure Schedule) and Section 6.14 hereof. 

  

 (c) Purchaser understands and agrees that any cost estimates, projections, forecasts, or other predictions which have been or may be provided to Purchaser by or on behalf of Wells Fargo or either Seller (including in the Confidential Memorandum) are not and shall not be deemed to be representations or warranties of Wells Fargo or the Sellers. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other predictions, (ii) Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties, (iii) Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the 

   ##### 

  

    

adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
predictions so furnished to it, and (iv) Purchaser shall have no claim
against Wells Fargo or either Seller or any of their respective officers,
directors, Affiliates or agents with respect thereto. 

  

 10.4 _General_. 

  

 (a) _Reserved_. 

  

 (b) To the extent that an Indemnified Purchaser Entity is entitled to indemnification with respect to any claim made under this Article X, Wells Fargo shall be subrogated to any right of action (other than a right of action against another Indemnified Purchaser Entity) which such Indemnified Purchaser Entity may have against any other person or entity with respect to any matter giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder. 

  

 (c) The indemnification provided in this Article X shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to Purchaser with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Sellers to Purchaser in this Agreement, except as to covenants or agreements contained in Sections 6.6(b), 6.13, 6.14, 6.15 and 6.17 or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) this Section 10.4(c) shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief (including, without limitation, the right of Purchaser to seek injunctive relief pursuant to the terms of Section 6.16), and (ii) except as set forth in Sections 10.3(b), 10.3(c) and 11.4(d), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or limit any remedy available at law or in equity for any fraud committed or made by any party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE XI 
 INDEMNIFICATION BY PURCHASER 

   

 11.1 _Indemnification_. In addition to and not in limitation of the indemnities provided in Section 7.11(a) (which Section sets forth the exclusive remedy of Wells Fargo and the Sellers in respect of the matters covered thereby), from and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this Article XI, Purchaser agrees to indemnify Wells Fargo, the Sellers, their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, directors and employees (collectively, the "Indemnified Seller Entities") and to hold each of them harmless from and against, and agrees to assume liability for, any and all Damages suffered, paid or incurred by such Indemnified Seller Entity resulting from or caused by: (a) any breach of any of the representations and warranties made by Purchaser to Wells Fargo and the Sellers in this Agreement ( _provided_ , that, for purposes of this Section 10.1(a), the determination of whether such breach has occurred will disregard (i) "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers and (ii) "knowledge" qualifiers, other than those involving knowledge of acts, activities or omissions or contemplated or threatened acts, activities or omissions of third parties (including, without limitation, Governmental Authorities)); (b) any breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement; or (c) any of the Assumed Liabilities. For purposes of the indemnity provided in this Section 11.1 in respect of the matters referred to in clause (c) above, indemnification payments made by Wells Fargo pursuant to Section 10.1(a) shall not be deemed to be "Damages suffered, paid or incurred" by an Indemnified Seller Entity. 

   ##### 

  

  

 11.2 _Indemnification Procedures, Etc_. 

  

 (a) If an Indemnified Seller Entity believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this Article XI (whether or not the amount of Damages relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified Seller Entity shall promptly assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice thereof (a "Claim Notice") to Purchaser. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim in reasonable detail. The failure to so notify Purchaser shall not relieve Purchaser of any obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Seller Entity unless (and then only to the extent that) such failure shall have adversely affected Purchasers ability to defend against, settle or satisfy any claim to which the Claim Notice relates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to claims for indemnification that do not involve a third-party claim (defined below), the Indemnified Seller Entities shall not deliver a Claim Notice with respect to any such claims unless the aggregate amount of Damages for all claims included within such Claim Notice exceeds One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($100,000.00). Purchaser shall not assert that any delay in delivering a Claim Notice resulting from the Indemnified Seller Entities compliance with the foregoing sentence has adversely affected Purchasers ability to defend against, settle or satisfy the claims for indemnification specified therein. 

  

 (b) If any claim or demand by an Indemnified Seller Entity under this Article XI relates to an action or claim filed or made against an Indemnified Seller Entity by a third party (a "third-party claim"), Purchaser will have the right to defend such Indemnified Seller Entity against the third-party claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Seller Entity so long as (i) Purchaser advises the Indemnified Seller Entity in writing of its election to assume such defense within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of the Claim Notice with respect to such third-party claim ( _provided_ , that if the Claim Notice specifies that it relates to a labor claim subject to summary proceedings legislation, Purchaser must advise the Indemnified Seller Entity in writing of its election to assume such defense within five (5) Business Days), (ii) the third-party claim involves money damages only and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief (or the Indemnified Seller Entity consents in writing to Purchaser assuming such defense notwithstanding the fact that the third-party claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief) and (iii) Purchaser conducts the defense of the third-party claim actively and diligently. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.2: (i) an Indemnified Seller Entity will be entitled to participate in the defense of any third-party claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose at its own sole cost and expense; and (ii) an Indemnified Seller Entity will be entitled to assume control of the defense of such third-party claim and Purchaser will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of a single counsel retained by such Indemnified Seller Entity (excluding the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Seller Entitys counsel incurred prior to the date of such assumption of the defense), if: (A) the Indemnified Seller Entity reasonably concludes that such third-party claim could reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on the business or reputation of Wells Fargo; (B) the Indemnified Seller Entity reasonably concludes that there exists a conflict of interest that, under applicable principles of legal ethics, would prohibit a single legal counsel from representing both 

   ##### 

  

    

the Indemnified Seller Entity and Wells Fargo in such third-party claim, and
such conflict has not been timely waived; (C) the Indemnified Purchaser
Entity reasonably concludes that there may be significant and colorable legal
defenses available to it that are inconsistent with those defenses available
to Purchaser; (D) such third-party claim could involve the imposition of
criminal penalties upon the Indemnified Seller Entity; or (E) Purchaser
either (1) has failed to give a notice of defense under Section 11.2(b)(i)
and timely assume the defense of such third-party claim or (2) is failing to
conduct the defense of such third-party claim actively and diligently. In
the event that an Indemnified Seller Entity assumes the defense of a third-
party claim in accordance with the preceding sentence, (x) Purchaser will
reimburse the Indemnified Seller Entity promptly and periodically for the
costs of defending against the third-party claim (including reasonable fees
and expenses of a single counsel), and (y) Purchaser will remain responsible
for any Damages the Indemnified Seller Entity may suffer resulting from,
caused by, or in connection with the third-party claim to the fullest extent
provided in this Article XI. 

  

 (d) So long as Purchaser is conducting the defense of the third-party claim in accordance with Section 11.2(b) or an Indemnified Seller Entity is conducting the defense pursuant to any of Sections 11.2(c)(ii)(A) through 11.2(c)(ii)(D), (i) the Indemnified Seller Entity will not consent to the entry of any judgment on, or enter into any settlement with respect to, the third-party claim without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) Purchaser will not consent to the entry of any judgment on, or enter into any settlement with respect to, the third-party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Seller Entity, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless such judgment or settlement involves only the payment of money damages by Purchaser and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Seller Entity. In the event that an Indemnified Seller Entity assumes control of the defense of a third-party claim pursuant to Section 11.2(c)(ii)(E), the Indemnified Seller Entity may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, a third-party claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Seller Entity need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, Purchaser in connection therewith); _provided_ , _however_ , that no such judgment or settlement shall impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon Purchaser or any of its Affiliates unless Purchaser has consented thereto in advance in writing. 

  

 (e) If Purchaser elects to defend any such third-party claim, then each Indemnified Seller Entity shall make available to Purchaser all information reasonably available to such Indemnified Seller Entity relating to such third-party claim. In addition, the parties hereto shall render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such third-party claim. The party in charge of the defense shall keep the other party fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. 

  

 11.3 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XI, the Indemnified Seller Entities shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI, with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1(a): 

   ##### 

  

   

 (i) until the earlier to occur of (A) the First Anniversary Date or (B) the date on which the aggregate Damages to all Indemnified Seller Entities (without duplication), with respect to all claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(a) ("Aggregate Seller Damages"), exceed the Threshold Amount, whereupon (subject to the provisions of clause (iv) below) Purchaser shall be obligated to pay in full all such amounts (including all amounts comprising the Threshold Amount or such lesser amount of Aggregate Seller Damages payable on the First Anniversary Date, which lesser amount shall be the "Purchaser First Anniversary Payment Amount"); _provided_ that in the event that the Threshold Amount has not been reached by the First Anniversary Date, Purchaser shall be obligated to pay all amounts in excess of the Purchaser First Anniversary Payment Amount with respect to Aggregate Seller Damages on the earlier to occur of (A) the date on which the Threshold Amount is reached or (B) the second anniversary of the Closing Date; 

   

 (ii) with respect to any claim for indemnification based upon a breach of any representation and warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement (other than those in Section 5.2 (for which a claim for indemnification may be made without any limitation on time)), the Claim Notice with respect to which is not received on or before the date that is two years after the Closing Date; 

   

 (iii) for Damages to the extent such Damages are incurred based on or in respect of any activities of Wells Fargo, the Sellers or their Affiliates from and after the Closing Date, or the business of the Sellers prior to the Closing Date except with respect to the Assumed Liabilities; or 

   

 (iv) for aggregate Damages in excess of the amount of One Hundred Thirty-Seven Million United States Dollars (US$137,000,000.00). 

  

 11.4 _General_. 

  

 (a) _Reserved_. 

  

 (b) To the extent that an Indemnified Seller Entity is entitled to indemnification with respect to any claim made under this Article XI, Purchaser shall be subrogated to any right of action (other than a right of action against another Indemnified Seller Entity) which such Indemnified Seller Entity may have against any other person or entity with respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. 

  

 (c) The indemnification provided in this Article XI shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to Sellers with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Purchaser to Wells Fargo and the Sellers in this Agreement, except as to covenants or agreements contained in Section 6.2, 6.6(a), 6.6(b) or 6.15 or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) this Section 11.4(c) shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief (including, without limitation, the right of Wells Fargo and the Sellers to seek injunctive relief 

   ##### 

  

    

pursuant to the terms of Section 6.16), and (ii) except as set forth in
Sections 10.3(b), 10.3(c) and 11.4(d), nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit or limit any remedy available at law or in equity for any fraud
committed or made by any party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in Article V or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Wells Fargo and the Sellers understand and agree that Purchaser is not making any representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied, other than those representations and warranties of Purchaser expressly set forth in Article V (including, and as qualified or modified by, the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule). 

  

ARTICLE XII 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS 

   

 12.1 _Survival; Agreed Disclaimer of Effect of Knowledge_. 

  

 (a) Each of the representations and warranties of the parties hereunder shall survive the Closing to and until the date which is two years from the Closing Date, at which date they shall terminate and be of no further force or effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the representations and warranties of Wells Fargo and the Sellers in Sections 4.13 and 4.18 shall survive the Closing to and until the date which is sixty (60) days following (i) the date of expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the matters covered by such representations and warranties (assuming no waiver or extension thereof effected in accordance with clause (ii) below), or (ii) if Purchaser waives or extends the applicable statute of limitations with the prior consent of Wells Fargo, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, the date of final settlement of such open tax period or the end of such extension, as the case may be, at which date they shall terminate and be of no further force or effect; and (b) the representations and warranties of Wells Fargo and the Sellers in Section 4.5 shall survive the Closing without limitation. Nothing in this Section 12.1 shall affect an Indemnified Purchaser Entitys or an Indemnified Seller Entitys right to indemnification under Article X or XI, respectively, for the breach of a representation or warranty if a Claim Notice with respect thereto (which Claim Notice shall describe the alleged breach in reasonable detail, including specific assertions as to the underlying supporting facts, as opposed to a general assertion of breach) is received by the Wells Fargo or Purchaser, respectively, within the survival periods referred to above. 

  

 (b) Each of Wells Fargo and the Sellers, for their part, and Purchaser, for its part, acknowledging that the other is entitled to rely on their or its representations and warranties in this Agreement (with such representations and warranties qualified only as provided therein and by the disclosures in the applicable Disclosure Schedule), in order to preserve the benefit of the bargain otherwise represented by this Agreement, agrees that neither the survival of such representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, nor their enforceability, nor any remedies for breaches of them will be affected by any knowledge of a party regardless of when or how such party acquired such knowledge, specifically including knowledge of a breach obtained after the signing of this Agreement and before the Closing occurs.
