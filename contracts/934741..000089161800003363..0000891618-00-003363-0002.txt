LETTER"), delivered by the Sellers to the Buyer on the date hereof and
attached hereto as Exhibit C, the Sellers, jointly and severally,
represent and warrant to the Buyer as follows:   3.1 Due Incorporation and
Authority. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio. The Company has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to
have such power and authority would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect (as defined below). As used in this Agreement, a "COMPANY MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT" means any effect (i) that is or could reasonably be expected
to be materially adverse to the financial condition, business, results of
operations, personnel, properties or assets (including intangible assets) of
the Company, except that events, circumstances, changes, developments,
impairments or conditions primarily resulting from events, changes or
developments in worldwide, national or local conditions or circumstances
(political, economic, regulatory or otherwise) that adversely affect the
Company\'s industry generally, or any change in law or accounting principles
(and any changes resulting therefrom), shall not constitute a
Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that could reasonably be expected to
materially impair or delay the ability of the Sellers to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.   3.2 Subsidiaries. The Company does not
directly or indirectly own any interest in any other Person.   3.3
Qualification. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing to do business in all other
jurisdictions where the Company currently conducts business that require
such     -2-  8  qualification or licensing, except where the failure
to so qualify or be licensed could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   3.4
Capitalization. The Company\'s authorized capital stock consists of 10,000
shares of common stock, par value $1,000 per share, of which 8,100 shares are
issued and outstanding. All issued and outstanding shares of common stock of
the Company are owned beneficially and of record by the Sellers in the
respective amounts set forth on Exhibit B hereto, and all of such shares are
duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. No other
class of capital stock or other ownership interests of the Company
is authorized or outstanding.   3.5 Options or Other Rights. Except as set
forth in Section 3.5 of the Sellers\' Disclosure Letter, there is no
outstanding right, subscription, warrant, call, unsatisfied preemptive right,
option or any other agreement to purchase, or otherwise to receive from the
Company, any shares of the capital stock or any other equity security of the
Company, and there is no outstanding security of the Company convertible into
any such capital stock or other equity security.   3.6 Charter Documents
and Corporate Records. The Sellers have previously made available to the
Buyer complete and correct copies of the Articles of Incorporation and the
Code of Regulations of the Company as in effect on the date hereof. The
minute books, the stock certificate books and stock record books of the

the completeness of such minute books or of any information contained
therein.   3.7 Financial Statements.   (a) The Sellers have previously

related notes and schedules thereto, accompanied by the related audit reports

Statements fairly present the financial position of the Company as of the
respective dates thereof and fairly present the results of operations and
cash flows of the Company for the respective fiscal periods covered thereby.
The Company Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as indicated in the notes
thereto.     -3-  9   (b) The Sellers have previously made
available to the Buyer copies of the unaudited balance sheet of the Company
for the nine months ended December 31, 1999, and the related statements of

the results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the nine months
then ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments). The Company Interim
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a

circumstance which, if the provisions of Section 6.1(c) had been applicable

(x), (xi) and (xii) thereof); or   (c) any other change, occurrence or
circumstance in the financial condition, business, results of operations,

be accompanied by a reasonably complete description of the basis for such
claim or demand (including an estimate of the amount thereof) and reference
to the provisions of this Agreement under which liability is asserted.  
(b) The indemnifying party shall have the right, at its own cost, to
participate jointly in the defense of any claim or demand in connection with
which the Indemnified Party has claimed indemnification hereunder, and may

Indemnified Party reasonably informed as to the status of such matter and
shall promptly send copies of all pleadings to the Indemnified Party;  
(ii) the indemnifying party shall not settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any such claim or demand that it elects

participate jointly in the defense of such claim or demand, but shall do so
at its own cost not subject to reimbursement under Section 10.1 or 10.2.  
If the indemnifying party does not elect to take over the defense of a claim
or demand, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, compromise
or settle such claim or demand in the exercise of its reasonable judgment;
provided, however, that the consent of the indemnifying party to any
compromise or settlement of such claim or demand shall be required, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.     -26-  32   (c) The
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from
claims by third parties and shall act in good faith in responding to,
defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such claims. Each party
agrees that it shall cooperate with the other parties in the defense of any
claim or action.   10.4 Measure of and Limitations upon Indemnification.  
(a) In determining the amount of any Loss for which any party is entitled to
indemnification under this Article 10, the gross amount thereof (a) will be
reduced by any insurance proceeds actually realized, over and above
applicable deductibles paid, by such party from third party insurers and (b)
will be increased by an Indemnified Party\'s tax cost and reduced by any
Indemnified Party\'s tax benefits to the extent such tax cost or tax benefit
results from the incurrence of such Loss.   (b) The Sellers\' liability for
any Losses under this Article 10 shall be subject to the following
limitations: (i) the Sellers shall have no liability for any Losses (other
than those arising out of, or resulting from, the breach by any Seller of its
representations and warranties in Sections 3.4, 3.10 or Article 4) unless and
until the aggregate amount of the Losses for which the Sellers are obligated
to indemnify pursuant to Section 10.1 shall exceed $5 million (the "THRESHOLD
AMOUNT") in which case the Sellers shall be liable only to the extent that
the aggregate amount of such Losses, as finally determined, shall exceed the
Threshold Amount; and (ii) the aggregate liability of the Sellers for all
Losses (other than those arising out of, or resulting from, the breach by any
Seller of its representations and warranties in Sections 3.4, 3.10 or Article
4) shall not exceed $350 million in the aggregate.   (c) The Buyer\'s
liability for any Losses under this Article 10 shall be subject to the
following limitations: (i) the Buyer shall have no liability for any Losses
(other than those arising out of, or resulting from, the breach by the Buyer
of its representations and warranties in Sections 5.4, 5.6 or 5.10) unless
and until the aggregate amount of the Losses for which the Buyer is obligated
to indemnify pursuant to Section 10.1 shall exceed the Threshold Amount in
which case the Buyer shall be liable only to the extent that the aggregate
amount of such Losses, as finally determined, shall exceed the Threshold
Amount; and (ii) the aggregate liability of the Buyer for all Losses (other
than those arising out of, or resulting from, the breach by the Buyer of its
representations and warranties in Sections 5.4, 5.6 or 5.10) shall not exceed
$350 million in the aggregate.   10.5 Exclusivity of Indemnity. The
indemnification provided in this Article 10 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy after the Closing Date for damages (whether directly or by way of
contribution) available to the parties to this Agreement for     -27- 
33  breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein or any right, claim or action arising from the
transactions contemplated hereby.   10.6 Subrogation. In the event of
payment by or on behalf of any indemnifying party to any Indemnified Party
(including pursuant to this Article 10) in connection with any claim or
demand by any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective
Affiliates, such indemnifying party shall, to the extent of such payment, be
subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party. Such
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with such indemnifying party in a
reasonable manner, and at the cost of such indemnifying party, in presenting
any subrogated right, defense or claim; provided that no such subrogation
shall adversely affect any rights of such Indemnified Party.   11.
Termination of Agreement.   11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be
terminated prior to the Closing as follows:   (a) at the election of the
Sellers, if any one or more of the conditions to the obligation of the
Sellers to close set forth in Article 8 (other than the condition contained
in Section 8.2) has not been fulfilled as of the close of business on June
30, 2000, except if the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby then
to be consummated shall be due to the failure of the Sellers to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of the Sellers set forth herein;   (b)
at the election of the Sellers, if the condition contained in Section 8.2 has
not been fulfilled within 30 days after the commencement of all applicable
waiting periods;   (c) at the election of the Buyer, if any one or more of
the conditions to the obligation of the Buyer to close set forth in Article 7
has not been fulfilled as of the close of business on June 30,
2000; provided, however, that if the condition contained in Section 7.2 is
the only condition contained in Article 7 (other than such conditions which
by their nature cannot be satisfied prior to the Closing) that has not been
fulfilled as of such date, then the Buyer may not exercise its termination
right under this Section 11.1(c) for an additional 60 days following such
date;   (d) at the election of the Sellers or the Buyer, if any legal
proceeding is commenced by any Governmental Body seeking to prevent the
consummation of the Closing or any other transaction contemplated hereby
and any Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be, reasonably and in good faith
deems it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed in view of such legal
proceeding;     -28-  34   (e) at the election of the Sellers, if the
Buyer has breached any material representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach cannot be or is not cured
by the Closing Date;   (f) at the election of the Buyer, if any of
the Sellers has breached any material representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement, which breach cannot be or is not
cured by the Closing Date; or   (g) at any time on or prior to the Closing
Date, by mutual written consent of the Sellers and the Buyer.   If this
Agreement so terminates, it shall become null and void and have no further
force or effect, except as provided in Section 11.2.   11.2 Survival After
Termination. If this Agreement terminates pursuant to Section 11.1 and the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, this Agreement shall
become null and void and have no further force or effect, except that any
such termination shall be without prejudice to the rights of any party on
account of the nonsatisfaction of the conditions set forth in Articles 7 and
8 resulting from the intentional or willful breach or violation of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of another party under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the provisions of Sections 6.2(b) and 6.4, this Section 11.2 and Articles 13
and 14 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.   12. Tax
Matters.   12.1 Liability for Taxes and Related Matters. Notwithstanding
the provisions of Article 10 of this Agreement:   (a) Liability for Taxes.
From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall be liable for and
indemnify the Buyer for all Taxes imposed on the Company or for which the
Company may otherwise be liable for any taxable year or period that ends on
or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any taxable year or period
beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, the portion of such
taxable year ending on and including the Closing Date, except for Taxes in an
amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Taxes of the Company reflected on the
Company Interim Financial Statements or reflected on the books and records of
the Company since December 31, 1999, in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. Except as set forth in Section 12.1(e), the
Sellers shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes of the Company received for
such periods.     -29-  35   (b) From and after the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall be liable for and indemnify the Sellers for the Taxes of the
Company for any taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date
and, with respect to any taxable year or period beginning before and ending
after the Closing Date, the portion of such taxable year beginning after the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes of the
Company received for such periods.   (c) Taxes for Short Taxable Year. For
purposes of Sections 12.1(a) and (b), whenever it is necessary to determine
the liability for Taxes of the Company for a portion of a taxable year or
period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination
of the Taxes of the Company for the portion of the year or period ending on,
and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the Closing Date shall
be determined by assuming that the Company had a taxable year or period which
ended at the close of the Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time basis.   (d) Adjustment to
Purchase Price. Any payment by the Buyer or the Sellers under this Article 12
will be an adjustment to the purchase price.   (e) Refunds from Carrybacks.
If the Sellers become entitled to a refund or credit of Taxes for any period
for which they are liable under Section 12.1(a) to indemnify the Buyer and
such Taxes are attributable solely to the carryback of losses, credits or
similar items attributable to the Company and from a taxable year or period
that begins after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall promptly pay to the
Buyer the amount of such refund or credit together with any interest thereon.
In the event that any refund or credit of Taxes for which a payment has been
made is subsequently reduced or disallowed, the Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers for any tax liability, including interest and
penalties, assessed against the Sellers by reason of the reduction or
disallowance.   (f) Tax Returns. The Sellers shall file or cause to be
filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to the Company for taxable years or periods ending on or before
the Closing Date and shall pay any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns,
except for Taxes in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Taxes of the
Company reflected on the Company Interim Financial Statements or reflected on
the books and records of the Company since December 31, 1999, in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, and the Buyer shall file or
cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by
or with respect to the Company for taxable years or periods ending after the
Closing Date and shall cause the Company to remit any Taxes due in respect of
such Tax Returns. The Sellers shall pay the Buyer the Taxes for which the
Sellers are liable pursuant to     -30-  36  Section 12.1(a) but which
are payable with Tax Returns to be filed by the Buyer pursuant to the
previous sentence within 10 days prior to the due date for the filing of such
Tax Returns.   (g) Contest Provisions. The Buyer shall promptly notify
Sellers in writing upon receipt by the Buyer or the Company of notice of any
pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign income or
franchise tax audits or assessments which may affect the tax liabilities of
the Company for which the Sellers would be required to indemnify the Buyer
pursuant to Section 12.1(a), provided that failure to comply with this
provision shall not affect the Buyer\'s right to indemnification hereunder.
The Sellers shall have the sole right to represent the Company\'s interests
in any tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of their
choice at their expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not
be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes which would adversely affect the liability
for Taxes of the Buyer or the Company for any period after the Closing Date
to any extent (including the imposition of income tax deficiencies, the
reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments, the lengthening of any
amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of amortization or
depreciation deductions, or the reduction of loss or credit carryforwards)
without the prior written consent of the Buyer. Such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, and shall not be necessary to the extent that the
Sellers have indemnified the Buyer against the effects of any such
settlement.   The Sellers shall be entitled to participate at their
expense in the defense of any claim for Taxes for a year or period ending
after the Closing Date which may be the subject of indemnification by the
Sellers pursuant to Section 12.1(a) and, with the written consent of the
Buyer, and at their sole expense, may assume the entire defense of such tax
claim. Neither the Buyer nor the Company may agree to settle any tax claim
for the portion of the year or period ending on the Closing Date which may be
the subject of indemnification by the Sellers under Section 12.1(a) without
the prior written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   (h) Any sharing agreement or arrangement, whether
or not written, that may have been entered into by the Sellers and
the Company shall be terminated as to the Company as of the Closing Date, and
no payments which are owed by or to the Company pursuant thereto shall be
made thereunder.   12.2 Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing
Date, each of the Sellers and the Buyer shall:     -31-  37   (a)
assist (and cause their respective affiliates to assist) the other parties in
preparing any Tax Returns or reports which such other parties are responsible
for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 12.1;   (b) cooperate
fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with taxing authorities
regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company;   (c) make available to the
other party or parties and to any taxing authority as reasonably requested
all information, records and documents relating to Taxes of the Company;  
(d) provide timely notice to the other party or parties in writing of any
pending or threatened tax audits or assessments of the Company for taxable
periods for which the other party or parties may have a liability under this
Article 12; and   (e) furnish the other party or parties with copies of all
correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection with any tax
audit or information request with respect to any such taxable period of the
Company.   12.3 Section 1445. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver a true and accurate certification satisfying the requirements
of Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) of the Treasury Regulations. In compliance with
Section 1.897-2(h)(2) and Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) of the Treasury Regulations,
notification that such certification has been given shall be made to the
