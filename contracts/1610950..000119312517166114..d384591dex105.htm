Exhibit 10.5

 

 _Execution Version_

 

May 10, 2017

Michael A. Bell

 

c/o inVentiv Health, Inc.

400 Atlantic Ave.

 

Boston, MA 02210

Dear Mike,

 

As you know, INC Research Holdings, Inc. (" _INC_ ") entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger with Double Eagle Parent, Inc. (" _Eagle_ "), the parent
of inVentiv Group Holdings, Inc., dated as of May 10, 2017 (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "). At the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (the " _Closing_ "), inVentiv Group Holdings, Inc., the direct
parent of inVentiv Health, Inc. (" _inVentiv_ ") will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of INC.

 

As a key member of inVentivs management team, we consider you integral to the
continued success of the combined company after the Closing. Accordingly, we
are excited to enter into this letter agreement with you which amends the
terms of your Amended and Restated Employment, Severance and Non-Competition
Agreement with inVentiv dated November 15, 2016 (the " _Employment Agreement_
").

This letter agreement will become effective as of and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing on the Closing Date (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) (such date, the " _Effective Date_ "). In the event the Merger
Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms this letter agreement will be
null and void and of no force or effect. Except as set forth below, all terms
and conditions of your Employment Agreement will continue as is (including
salary and bonus). Terms not defined herein will have the meanings set forth
in your Employment Agreement.

 



     | 1. | Your New Role. Immediately after the Closing, you will become
the Executive Chairman of INC, or its successor. As Chairman of the INC Board
of Directors (the " _Board_ ") you will lead and set the agenda for Board
meetings and oversee the Board in accordance with the Companys corporate
governance documents. As an executive officer of INC you will provide guidance
and counsel to the senior executive team as needed and, until a
successor division head is chosen, run the commercial division, and in your
role running the commercial division will report to the Chief Executive
Officer. On the date of INCs 2019 annual shareholders meeting or two years
from the date of this letter, whichever is sooner (the " _Transition Date_
"), you will resign from the Board and cease to be Chairman, but may continue
as an executive officer of INC. 
---|---|--- 
 

Prior to the Transition Date, INC may terminate your employment only upon
majority approval of the Board (with you and the CEO abstaining from any such
decision). Upon any termination of employment by the Board or your
resignation, you agree to resign from the Board.

Your annual performance bonus will be calculated in a manner consistent with
other senior executives of INC, provided that your annual bonus will not be
subject to negative discretion for any portion of such bonus based on personal
performance.



     | 2. | Severance Entitlement. If your employment is terminated by
INC without Cause or you resign for Good Reason, in either case prior to the
Transition Date, then you will be entitled to receive $2,550,000 in
cash severance with interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum
compounded from the Effective Date until paid in full and otherwise pursuant
to Section 4(a)(ii) of your Employment Agreement (along with the other
severance entitlements under Sections 4(a)(i) and 4(a)(iii)-(vi)).
Additionally, any pending restrictions on the sale of shares of common stock
of INC that were issued to you upon the exercise of options will lapse upon
termination without cause or a resignation for Good Reason. 
---|---|--- 

If you are still employed with INC on the Transition Date, then you will
receive a fully vested $2,550,000 deferred compensation entitlement that will
accrue a compound rate of interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the
Effective Date until paid in full and as otherwise payable as described in
Section 4(a)(ii) of your Employment Agreement. Upon your Termination Date,
you will also be eligible to receive the severance benefits under Section
4(a)(iii)-(vi), payable in accordance with those provisions. Additionally, any
pending restrictions on the sale of shares of common stock of INC that were
issued to you upon the exercise of options will lapse on the Transition Date.
After the Transition Date, you will no longer be entitled to any cash
severance under Section 4(a)(ii) of your Employment Agreement.

 

You agree that your new role with INC will not be a basis for you to resign
your employment for "Good Reason" and your "Good Reason" rights will be
measured by reference to such new role. In addition to your current "Good
Reason" rights under your Employment Agreement (as modified by the immediately
preceding sentence), you will also have "Good Reason" to resign your
employment if (1) you cease to be Chairman of the Board on the Transition Date
for any reason or (2) you are replaced as head of the commercial division
prior to the Transition Date.

 



     | 3. | 2018 LTI Awards. You will receive a 2018 annual long-term
incentive award and deal closing "founders" award (if such award is made)
(collectively the " _2018 Awards_ ") and a 2019 annual long-term incentive
award (the " _2019 Award_ s") at the same time grants are made to other senior
executives of INC, in an amount not less than 80% of that received by the
Chief Executive Officer in the case of the 2018 Awards, and not less than
five-twelfths (5/12) of 80% of that received by the Chief Executive Officer in
the case of the 2019 Awards. Historically annual grants have been made in
January. 
---|---|--- 
 

If your employment is terminated by INC without Cause or you resign for Good
Reason, in either case at any time after 2018 Awards and/or the 2019 Award
have been made, then any 2018 Awards and/or 2019 Awards that are subject to
time-based vesting will fully vest and any such 2018 Awards and/or 2019 Awards
that are subject to performance-based vesting that are eligible to vest in
the calendar year of such termination or resignation will vest and the
remaining awards that are subject to performance-based vesting will terminate
without

 payment. To the extent that any awards for which vesting is accelerated
pursuant to the foregoing are restricted stock units, settlement with respect
to such awards will be made upon the Termination Date.

We look forward to your acceptance of this letter agreement, which you can
indicate by promptly signing, dating and returning a copy of this letter
agreement to me.

Very truly yours,



      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
