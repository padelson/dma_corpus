                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of May
9, 2001, by and among FELCOR LODGING TRUST INCORPORATED, a Maryland corporation
("FelCor"), and FELCOR LODGING LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware limited
partnership ("FelCor OP" and, together with FelCor, the "FelCor Parties"), on
the one hand, and MERISTAR HOSPITALITY CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation
("MeriStar"), and MERISTAR HOSPITALITY OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership ("MeriStar OP" and, together with MeriStar, the "MeriStar
Parties"), on the other hand.

                                    RECITALS:

         A.       The Board of Directors of FelCor and the Board of Directors of
MeriStar have each determined that a business combination between FelCor and
MeriStar on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
is advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies and
stockholders and presents an opportunity for their respective companies to
achieve long-term strategic and financial benefits and, accordingly, have agreed
to effect the merger (the "Merger") of MeriStar with and into FelCor, with
FelCor being the surviving corporation, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

         B.       Upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, MeriStar and
FelCor shall execute Articles of Merger (the "Articles of Merger") in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and shall file such
Articles of Merger in accordance with applicable Maryland law to effectuate the
Merger.

         C.       For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
that this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

         D.       Concurrent with the Merger, the MeriStar Parties and the
FelCor Parties will effect a merger of MeriStar OP with and into FelCor OP as
contemplated by Section 3.1, with FelCor OP as the survivor (the "OP Merger")
(the Merger, together with the other transactions, including without limitation,
the OP Merger, contemplated by this Agreement, being referred to collectively
herein as the "Transactions").

         E.       The FelCor Parties and the MeriStar Parties desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the
Transactions.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

<PAGE>

                                   ARTICLE 1

                                   THE MERGER

         1.1      THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law
("MGCL"), MeriStar shall be merged with and into FelCor at the Effective Time
(as defined in Section 1.3). FelCor shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Maryland under the name "FelCor Lodging Trust Incorporated." The effects and
consequences of the Merger are set forth in Sections 1.4 through 1.6 and Article
2 hereof. FelCor, after the Effective Time, is sometimes referred to herein as
the "Surviving Corporation."

         1.2      CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Jenkens & Gilchrist, a Professional Corporation, 1445
Ross Avenue, Suite 3200, Dallas, Texas 75202, at 10:00 A.M. local time, on the
third New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") trading day immediately following
the date on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article 8 hereof
(other than conditions with respect to actions the respective parties will take
at the Closing) is first fulfilled or has been waived, if all such conditions
continue to be so satisfied or waived on such third trading day. If all such
conditions are not so satisfied or waived, the Closing shall be automatically
extended from time to time until the first subsequent trading day on which all
such conditions are again so satisfied or waived, subject, however, to Article 9
hereof. Alternatively, the Closing may occur at such other time, date and place
as MeriStar and FelCor shall mutually agree in writing. The date on which the
Closing occurs is the "Closing Date."

         1.3      EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger shall become effective (the
"Effective Time") at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the NYSE trading day
immediately following the Closing Date or, if later, such date and time as the
State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland ("Department") accepts
the Articles of Merger for record, or such other time specified in the Articles
of Merger (not to exceed 30 calendar days after the Articles of Merger are
accepted for record by the Department). Unless otherwise agreed, the parties
will cause the Effective Time to occur at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
NYSE trading day immediately following the Closing Date.

         1.4      EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the MGCL.

         1.5      CHARTERS AND BYLAWS. The charter of FelCor, as in effect on
the date hereof (the "FelCor Charter"), and as amended, prior to or at the
Effective Time, to reflect such matters as the parties may agree upon (the
"Amended FelCor Charter"), shall be the charter of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided by applicable law. The bylaws of FelCor, as
in effect on the date hereof (the "FelCor Bylaws"), and as amended, prior to the
Effective Time, to reflect such matters as the parties may agree upon (the
"Amended FelCor Bylaws"), shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by applicable law, the Amended FelCor Charter and
such Amended FelCor Bylaws.

         1.6      DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.

         (a)      The directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time shall be the persons named on Schedule 1.6(a) to
this Agreement, each of whom shall serve as a "Class I," "Class II" or "Class
III" director, as specified on such schedule, until the earlier of his
resignation or removal or until his successor is duly elected and qualifies.

         (b)      FelCor and MeriStar agree that, in the event any person set
forth on Schedule 1.6(a) is unable or otherwise fails to serve, for any reason,
as a director of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time, then (i) if
such person was a member of the Board of Directors of MeriStar as of the date
hereof, MeriStar shall have the right to designate another individual, subject
to FelCor's reasonable approval, to serve as a director of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time, (ii) if such person was a member of the Board
of Directors of FelCor as of the date hereof, FelCor shall have the right to
designate another individual, subject to MeriStar's reasonable approval, to
serve as a director of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time or (iii)
if such person was not a member of the Board of Directors of either MeriStar or
FelCor as of the date hereof, a majority of the persons set forth on Schedule
1.6(a) shall have the right to designate another individual to serve as a
director of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time. FelCor shall use
its best efforts to have any person designated to be a director pursuant to the
previous sentence appointed as a director.

         (c)      The officers of FelCor immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to serve until the
earlier of his resignation or removal or until his successor is duly elected and
qualifies.

                                   ARTICLE 2

                               TREATMENT OF SHARES

         2.1      EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON STOCK.

         (a)      COMMON STOCK OF MERISTAR. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any stock of
MeriStar, subject to Section 2.1(b), each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MeriStar ("MeriStar Common Stock"), other
than shares of MeriStar Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b),
shall be converted into (i) the right to receive cash in the amount of $4.60
(the "Cash Consideration"), without interest, and (ii) 0.784 (the "Exchange
Ratio") of one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of FelCor ("FelCor Common Stock"). All such shares of MeriStar
Common Stock automatically shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist and be outstanding, and each certificate previously evidencing any such
shares shall thereafter represent such number of whole shares of FelCor Common
Stock into which such MeriStar Common Stock was converted in accordance with the
Exchange Ratio (the "Share Consideration") and the right to receive, without
interest, the Cash Consideration (collectively with the Share Consideration, the
"Merger Consideration"). The holders of such certificates previously
representing such

                                        3

<PAGE>

shares of MeriStar Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of MeriStar
Common Stock, except as otherwise provided herein or by law. No fractional share
of FelCor Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger. In lieu
thereof, a cash payment shall be made to each holder of a fractional share
interest pursuant to Section 2.2(d) or Section 2.2(e). If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of MeriStar Common
Stock or FelCor Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares,
the Cash Consideration and Exchange Ratio each shall be correspondingly adjusted
to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares.

         (b)      CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN SHARES OF MERISTAR COMMON STOCK. As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of any holder thereof, any shares of MeriStar Common Stock that are owned by
MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary (defined herein) (other than any shares held
in a fiduciary capacity) or by FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary (as defined
herein) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no Merger
Consideration or other consideration shall be issued or delivered in exchange
therefor.

         (c)      STOCK OF FELCOR. Each issued and outstanding share of FelCor
Common Stock, FelCor Series A Preferred Stock (as defined herein) and FelCor
Series B Preferred Stock (as defined herein) outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will remain outstanding, and each certificate representing
outstanding shares of FelCor Common Stock, FelCor Series A Preferred Stock and
FelCor Series B Preferred Stock will thereafter represent an equal number of
shares of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock,
as the case may be, of the Surviving Corporation.

         2.2      DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION.

         (a)      DEPOSIT WITH EXCHANGE AGENT. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, FelCor shall deposit, in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of MeriStar Common Stock to be converted pursuant to Section 2.1, with
FelCor's transfer agent (the "Exchange Agent"), certificates representing that
number of shares of FelCor Common Stock required to effect the issuance of the
Share Consideration referred to in Section 2.1(a), and cash in the amount
required to effect the payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration referred to
in Section 2.1(a) and the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.2(d) or 2.2(e) (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as contemplated by this
Agreement.

         (b)      DELIVERY PROCEDURES. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, FelCor shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificate" or the
"Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of MeriStar Common Stock (the "Canceled Shares") that were
converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
and reasonable form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent)

                                        4

and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the MeriStar Common
Stock. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, FelCor may rely
conclusively on the stockholder records of MeriStar in determining the identity
of, and the number of Canceled Shares held by, each holder of a Certificate at
the Effective Time. Without limitation to the rights under Section 2.2(c), upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent for cancellation (or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by FelCor), together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and such other customary documents as the
Exchange Agent shall require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive, with respect to the shares of MeriStar Common Stock formerly
represented thereby (A) a certificate or certificates representing that number
of whole shares of FelCor Common Stock into which such shares of MeriStar Common
Stock were converted pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(a), (B) a check
in payment of the Cash Consideration, without interest, which such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1(a), and (C) a
check in payment of the cash in lieu of fractional shares, without interest,
which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(d) or (e).
Until such surrender of a Certificate in compliance with the immediately
preceding sentence, FelCor shall have no obligation to deliver the items
required by clauses (A) through (C) of such sentence. FelCor shall cause all
shares of FelCor Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger to be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to
preemptive rights.

         (c)      CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS.

                  (i)      The FelCor Parties and the MeriStar Parties each
                           shall authorize under applicable law a dividend or
                           distribution to their respective stockholders and
                           partners, as the case may be, for which the record
                           date shall be the close of business on the Closing
                           Date; provided, however, that such authorization
                           shall not be made if the Closing Date occurs within
                           15 days after the record date for a regularly
                           scheduled dividend or distribution by the FelCor
                           Parties, unless FelCor elects in its discretion to
                           require both such authorizations to occur. The
                           dividend or distribution shall be equal to such
                           parties' most recent quarterly dividend or
                           distribution rate for such stockholders and partners,
                           as the case may be, multiplied by a fraction, the
                           numerator of which is the number of days elapsed
                           since the last dividend record date through and
                           including the Effective Time, and the denominator of
                           which is 91. Any dividend or distribution made by the
                           FelCor Parties pursuant to this Section 2.2(c)(i)
                           shall be paid in the ordinary course of business
                           consistent with the past practice of such parties as
                           to the manner and timing of payment. Any dividend or
                           distribution made by the MeriStar Parties pursuant to
                           this Section 2.2(c)(i) shall be paid pursuant to the
                           procedures set forth in Section 2.2(c)(ii).

                  (ii)     If, after taking into account (A) the regular
                           quarterly dividends or distributions declared by
                           MeriStar to its stockholders with respect to its
                           taxable year ending at the Effective Time and (B) any
                           dividend or distribution that is to be paid to
                           holders of MeriStar Common Stock

                           under Section 2.2(c)(i), MeriStar would fail to
                           satisfy the requirements of Section 857(a)(1) of the
                           Code for the taxable year of MeriStar ending at the
                           Effective Time, then either (X) the amount of the
                           dividend or distribution with respect to MeriStar
                           Common Stock under Section 2.2(c)(i) shall be
                           increased or (Y) if no dividend or distribution was
                           declared by MeriStar under Section 2.2(c)(i),
                           MeriStar shall declare a dividend, in either event in
                           an amount sufficient for MeriStar to satisfy the
                           requirements of Section 857(a)(1) of the Code for
                           such period. Any dividend or distribution made by
                           MeriStar pursuant to Section 2.2(c)(i) and/or
                           pursuant to this Section 2.2(c)(ii) (the "Final
                           MeriStar Dividend") shall be declared and paid to
                           holders of shares of MeriStar Common Stock as of a
                           record date which shall be the close of business on
                           the Closing Date. Any Final MeriStar Dividend shall
                           be paid by MeriStar to the stock transfer agent of
                           MeriStar (the "MeriStar Transfer Agent") on the
                           Closing Date, and the MeriStar Transfer Agent shall
                           pay the Final MeriStar Dividend to the holders of the
                           MeriStar Common Stock on or before 30 days following
                           the Closing Date. The FelCor Parties and the MeriStar
                           Parties, by mutual agreement, may accelerate the
                           declaration date, the record date, and/or the payment
                           date of any Final MeriStar Dividend in order to
                           enable MeriStar to avoid or minimize excise tax
                           liability under Section 4981 of the Code for its
                           taxable year ending at the Effective Time. In the
                           event that MeriStar declares a Final MeriStar
                           Dividend with respect to the MeriStar Common Stock,
                           MeriStar OP shall simultaneously declare a
                           distribution (the "Final MeriStar OP Distribution")
                           to holders of MeriStar OP Units in an amount per unit
                           equal to the Final MeriStar Dividend payable per
                           share of MeriStar Common Stock, the record date for
                           which shall be the close of business on the Closing
                           Date. Any Final MeriStar OP Distribution shall be
                           paid by MeriStar OP to the MeriStar Transfer Agent on
                           the Closing Date and the MeriStar Transfer Agent
                           shall pay such distribution to the holders of the
                           MeriStar OP Units on or before 30 days following the
                           Closing Date. MeriStar shall notify FelCor of the
                           expected amount of any MeriStar Final Dividend at
                           least 20 days prior to the date for the declaration
                           of any Final MeriStar Dividend.

                  (iii)    Except for (A) regular quarterly dividends or
                           distributions declared and paid by the MeriStar
                           Parties and the FelCor Parties to their respective
                           stockholders and partners in the ordinary and normal
                           course of business, having record and payment dates
                           consistent with their respective past practices and
                           being in amounts not greater than the respective
                           party's last dividend or distribution prior to the
                           date hereof, and (B) the dividend or distribution
                           contemplated by Section 2.2(c)(i) and Section
                           2.2(c)(ii), neither the MeriStar Parties nor the
                           FelCor Parties will declare or pay any dividend or
                           distribution to their respective stockholders or
                           partners prior to the Effective Time.

                  (iv)     No dividends or other distributions declared or made
                           after the Effective Time with respect to shares of
                           FelCor Common Stock with a record date after the
                           Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
                           unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares
                           of FelCor Common Stock represented thereby until the
                           holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
                           Certificate in the manner provided in Section 2.2(b).
                           Subject to the effect of unclaimed property, escheat
                           and other applicable laws, following surrender of any
                           such Certificate, in addition to the Merger
                           Consideration, there shall be paid to the holder of
                           the certificates representing whole shares of FelCor
                           Common Stock issued in consideration therefor,
                           without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender,
                           the amount of dividends or other distributions
                           thereon with a record date after the Effective Time
                           and theretofore paid with respect to such whole
                           shares of FelCor Common Stock and (ii) at the
                           appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
                           other distributions thereon, with a record date after
                           the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and
                           having a payment date subsequent to such surrender.

         (d)      NO FRACTIONAL SECURITIES. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fractional shares of FelCor Common Stock will be issued in connection
with the Merger. No holder of a fractional share interest will be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other stockholder rights in respect of such
fractional share. Instead, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent will determine the excess of (i) the number of whole shares of
FelCor Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by FelCor pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of FelCor Common
Stock to be distributed to holders of MeriStar Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.2(b) (such excess, the "Excess Shares"). FelCor will instruct the Exchange
Agent (i) to sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE
through one or more member firms of the NYSE and (ii) to use reasonable efforts
to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective
Time as, in the Exchange Agent's sole judgment, is practicable consistent with
obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market
conditions and, in any event, within ten calendar days following the Effective
Time. The Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of
MeriStar Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of FelCor Common Stock, and will determine the portion of the proceeds to
which each such holder is entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate net proceeds of such sale by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of the fractional share interest to which each such holder is entitled,
and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share
interests to which all such holders of MeriStar Common Stock are entitled. The
Surviving Corporation will pay all commissions, transfer taxes, Exchange Agent's
fees and other out-of-pocket transaction costs incurred in connection with the
sale of such Excess Shares.

         (e)      ALTERNATIVE CASH PAYMENT. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 2.2(d), FelCor may elect at its option, exercised prior to the Effective
Time, in lieu of the issuance and sale of Excess Shares and the making of
payments pursuant to Section 2.2(d), to pay

                                        7

<PAGE>

each holder of MeriStar Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive
a fraction of a share of FelCor Common Stock, an amount in cash equal to the
Market Price determined as of the Closing Date, without interest, multiplied by
the fraction of a share of FelCor Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled. For purposes of this Agreement, "Market Price" means the
average of the closing sale prices of a share of FelCor Common Stock (as
reported in the NYSE Composite Tape) for the ten consecutive NYSE trading days
ending two trading days prior to the date as of which such determination is to
be made.

         (f)      CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS; ETC. From and after the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of MeriStar shall be closed and no registration
of any transfer of stock of MeriStar shall thereafter be made on the records of
MeriStar. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Canceled Shares which is
not registered in the transfer records of MeriStar, a certificate representing
the proper number of shares of FelCor Common Stock and a check or checks for the
Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares may be issued to a
transferee in the proper amount or amounts if the Certificate representing such
Canceled Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. In the event any Certificate(s)
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of any affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such certificates to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by FelCor or the Exchange Agent, upon the posting by
such person of a bond, in an amount reasonably determined by FelCor or the
Exchange Agent, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent will issue in respect of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate(s), the Merger Consideration to be
received in exchange therefor (together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable in accordance with Section 2.2(d) or (e)).

         (g)      WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. FelCor or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of MeriStar Common Stock,
such amounts as FelCor or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
FelCor or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
MeriStar Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by FelCor or the Exchange Agent.

         (h)      TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE. Any certificates representing Share
Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and
not exchanged within one year after the Effective Time pursuant to this Section
2.2 shall be returned by the Exchange Agent to FelCor, which shall thereafter
act as Exchange Agent. All funds held by the Exchange Agent for payment to the
holders of unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed at the end of one year from
the Effective Time shall be returned to FelCor. Thereafter, any holder of
unsurrendered Certificates shall look solely to FelCor for the payment of any
funds to which such holder may be entitled, subject to applicable law. FelCor
shall not be liable to any Person for such shares or funds delivered by it to a
public official pursuant to any

                                        8

<PAGE>

applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. As used in this
Agreement, the term "Person" shall mean any natural person, corporation, general
or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust,
association, unincorporated organization or entity of any kind.

OP Merger, by virtue of the OP Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder of the partnership interests in MeriStar OP known as "Class D Units"
(herein called "MeriStar Class D Units"), each outstanding MeriStar Class D Unit
shall be converted into the right to receive one unit of partnership interest in
FelCor OP known as "Class D Units" (herein called "FelCor Class D Units").

         (e)      POP UNITS OF MERISTAR OP. As of the effectiveness of the OP
Merger, by virtue of the OP Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder of the partnership interests in MeriStar OP known as "POP Units" (herein
called "MeriStar POP Units"), each outstanding MeriStar POP Unit that is Vested
(as defined below) shall be converted into the right to receive (i) the number
of FelCor Common Units equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio times the
Exchange Factor (as defined below) and (ii) cash in an amount equal to the
product of the Cash Consideration, without interest, times the Exchange Factor
(as defined below). The term "Vested" means those MeriStar POP Units that are
fully vested and not subject to forfeiture as of the Effective Time, assuming
the Merger was completed, under the respective Restricted Unit Agreements (as
defined in the MeriStar Profits-Only Operating Partnership Units Plan (the "POP
Unit Plan")) dated effective as of March 29, 2000 and April 16, 2001 between
MeriStar, MeriStar OP and each of the respective holders of such MeriStar POP
Units. The term "Exchange Factor" shall mean 1.0. As of the effectiveness of the
OP Merger, by virtue of the OP Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder of the POP Units, each outstanding MeriStar POP Unit that is not Vested
shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and no consideration shall be issued or
delivered in exchange therefor.

         (f)      GENERAL PARTNER INTERESTS OF MERISTAR OP. As of the

partnership interest in MeriStar OP (the "MeriStar GP Interest"), each unit of
partnership interest that constitutes part of the MeriStar GP Interest shall be
converted into the right to receive (i) the number of FelCor Common Units equal

MeriStar Class B Units, MeriStar Class C Units, MeriStar Class D Units, MeriStar
POP Units and MeriStar GP Interest (collectively, the "MeriStar OP Units") shall
no longer be outstanding and shall

                                       10

<PAGE>

automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
MeriStar OP Unit shall thereafter represent the right to receive, upon making
the deliveries required by Section 3.6(a), such number of whole FelCor Common
Units, FelCor Class C Units, and FelCor Class D Units (collectively the "New
FelCor OP Units"), and certificates representing such FelCor OP Units, into
which such MeriStar OP Units were converted in accordance with Section
3.5(a)-(f) plus any applicable Cash Consideration, without interest. The holders
of such MeriStar OP Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such MeriStar OP Units except as
otherwise provided herein or by law. No fractional New FelCor OP Units shall be
issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment, without interest, shall be made
pursuant to Section 3.6(c).

         3.6      ISSUANCE OF NEW CERTIFICATES FOR FELCOR OP UNITS.

         (a)      DELIVERY PROCEDURES. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, FelCor OP shall mail to each holder of record of a MeriStar OP
Unit (a "MeriStar OP Unit Holder"), a ratification and joinder agreement (a
"Ratification Agreement") by which the MeriStar OP Unit Holder ratifies and
agrees to be bound by the Restated Partnership Agreement, waives any rights they
have under their exchange rights agreements with MeriStar and MeriStar OP,
acknowledges the termination of the MeriStar OP Partnership Agreement and is
admitted as a limited partner in FelCor OP as a holder of the respective New
FelCor OP Units which the MeriStar OP Unit Holder is entitled to receive by
virtue of the OP Merger. The Ratification Agreement to be executed by holders of
MeriStar POP Units will also contain a waiver of any rights they have under the
agreements by which their POP Units were granted or under the POP Unit Plan.
Without limitation to the rights under Section 3.6(b), upon delivery to FelCor
OP of a duly executed Ratification Agreement, together with such other customary
documents as FelCor OP may require, the MeriStar OP Unit Holder shall be
entitled to receive, with respect to such MeriStar OP Units (i) a certificate or
certificates representing that number of whole New FelCor OP Units which such
MeriStar OP Unit Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.5, (ii) a
check in payment of the Cash Consideration, if any, without interest, which such
MeriStar OP Unit Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.5, and
(iii) a check in payment of the cash in lieu of fractional New FelCor OP Units,
without interest, which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
3.6(c). FelCor OP shall cause all FelCor OP Units issued pursuant to the OP
Merger to be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
not subject to preemptive rights.

         (b)      DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER EFFECTIVE TIME. No distributions declared
or made after the Effective Time with respect to New FelCor OP Units with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to any MeriStar OP Unit
Holder with respect to New FelCor OP Units until such MeriStar OP Unit Holder
executes and delivers to FelCor OP a Ratification Agreement. Subject to the
effect of unclaimed property, escheat and other applicable laws, following
delivery to FelCor OP of any such Ratification Agreement, in addition to the
consideration required by Section 3.5, there shall be paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole New FelCor OP Units issued in consideration
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such delivery, the amount of
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such whole New FelCor OP Units and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of distributions with a record date after the

                                       11

<PAGE>

Effective Time but prior to delivery and a payment date subsequent to delivery
payable with respect to such whole New FelCor OP Units.

         (c)      NO FRACTIONAL FELCOR OP UNITS. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, no fractional New FelCor OP Units will be issued in connection
with the OP Merger. In lieu of issuance of a fractional New FelCor OP Unit,
FelCor OP shall pay each MeriStar OP Unit Holder who would otherwise be entitled
to receive a fraction of a New FelCor OP Unit, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Market Price determined as of the Closing Date multiplied
by the fraction of a New FelCor OP Unit to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled.

         (d)      WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. FelCor OP shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under Section 3.5 to any
holder of MeriStar OP Units, such amounts as FelCor OP is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by FelCor OP, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the MeriStar OP Units, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by FelCor OP.

                                   ARTICLE 4

corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of
Maryland, having the requisite corporate power to carry on its business as now
being conducted. MeriStar is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets,
financial condition or results of operations of MeriStar and the MeriStar
Subsidiaries (as defined below), taken as a whole, or on the ability of the
MeriStar Parties to perform any of their respective substantive obligations
under this Agreement (any such effect, a "MeriStar Material Adverse Effect").
MeriStar has delivered to the FelCor Parties complete and correct copies of
MeriStar's Second Articles of Amendment and Restatement (the "MeriStar Charter")
and the Bylaws of MeriStar (the "MeriStar Bylaws"), in each case, as amended or

Partnership Agreement") and pursuant to applicable securities laws. MeriStar OP
has not issued or granted and is not a party to any outstanding commitments of
any kind relating to, or any presently effective agreements or understandings
with respect to, interests in MeriStar OP, whether issued or unissued, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for interests in MeriStar OP or
preemptive rights to purchase or rights of first refusal with respect to such
interests. Except as listed on Schedule 4.2(a) to the MeriStar Disclosure
Letter, no MeriStar OP Units, or other interests therein, have been authorized
or reserved for issuance to anyone other than MeriStar LP or MeriStar.

         (b)      Schedule 4.2(b) to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter sets forth

Subsidiary, and (v) each entity not constituting a MeriStar Subsidiary in which
MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary holds an ownership interest, indicating the
name, nature and business of such entity and the ownership interest therein held
by MeriStar, each MeriStar Subsidiary and each other Person. As used in this
Agreement, "Subsidiary" of any Person means any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other legal entity of which
such Person (either directly or through or together with another Subsidiary of
such Person) owns 50% or more of the capital stock or other equity interests of
such corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust
or other legal entity, except for passive investments held solely for investment
purposes and which are not material in amount.

<PAGE>

         (c)      Except as set forth in Schedule 4.2(c) to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter, (i) all the outstanding shares of capital stock of each
MeriStar Subsidiary that is a corporation have been duly and validly issued and
are (A) fully paid and nonassessable, (B) owned by MeriStar or by another
MeriStar Subsidiary and (C) owned free and clear of all Liens and (ii) all
equity interests owned by MeriStar or a MeriStar Subsidiary in another MeriStar
Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or

jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, and each MeriStar
Subsidiary that is a partnership, limited liability company or trust is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has the requisite power and authority to carry on its business
as now being conducted. Each MeriStar Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have a MeriStar Material Adverse Effect. Copies of the articles or
certificates of incorporation, bylaws, organizational documents and partnership,
joint venture and operating agreements of each MeriStar Subsidiary, in each case
as amended to the date of this Agreement, have been previously delivered or made
available to the FelCor Parties. Neither MeriStar nor any of the MeriStar
Subsidiaries is in breach of any provision of any agreement, document or
contract governing its rights in or to the interests owned or held by it other
than breaches which could not reasonably be expected to have a MeriStar Material
Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of MeriStar (as defined in Section 4.23), the
other parties to such agreements, documents or contracts are not in breach of
any of their respective obligations under such agreements, documents or
contracts other than breaches which could not reasonably be expected to have a
MeriStar Material Adverse Effect.

conducted. MeriStar OP is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing

Material Adverse Effect. MeriStar has delivered to the FelCor Parties complete
and correct copies of the MeriStar OP Partnership Agreement as amended or

         4.5      REGISTRATION RIGHTS. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.5 to

"MeriStar Stockholder Approvals"), to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. MeriStar OP has the requisite partnership power and authority

on the part of the MeriStar Parties, except for and subject to the MeriStar
Stockholder Approvals with respect to MeriStar and the approvals set forth on

Parties do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the Transactions), and compliance by
the MeriStar Parties with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict
with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any substantive obligation or to loss of a substantive benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of the MeriStar Parties or any MeriStar Subsidiary, under, (i) the
MeriStar Charter, the MeriStar Bylaws or the charter, organizational documents,
limited liability company agreement, partnership agreement or other governing

<PAGE>

MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary, or their respective properties or assets,
other than, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts, violations,
defaults, rights, loss or Liens that individually or in the aggregate would not
(x) have a MeriStar Material Adverse Effect or (y) prevent the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any federal,
state or local government or any court, administrative or regulatory agency or

"Governmental Entity"), is required in connection with the execution and

         4.7      SEC DOCUMENTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.
MeriStar and its predecessors have filed all required reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents with the SEC since July 31, 1996 through the date
hereof (the "MeriStar SEC Documents"). Except as set forth on Schedule 4.7 to
the MeriStar Disclosure Letter, no MeriStar Subsidiary is required to file any
form, report, registration statement, prospectus or other document with the SEC.
All of the MeriStar SEC Documents (other than preliminary materials), as of
their respective filing dates, complied in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), and, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to such MeriStar SEC Documents. None of the MeriStar SEC
Documents at the time of filing contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent such statements
have been modified or superseded by later MeriStar SEC Documents filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement. The consolidated
financial statements of MeriStar included in the MeriStar SEC Documents complied
as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented, in accordance with the applicable requirements of GAAP and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the consolidated financial position
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of

                                       17

<PAGE>

operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments) of MeriStar and the
MeriStar Subsidiaries. Except for liabilities and obligations set forth in the
MeriStar SEC Documents or in Schedule 4.7 to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter,
neither MeriStar nor any of the MeriStar Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise),
which are required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of
MeriStar or in the notes thereto and which, individually or in the aggregate,
would have a MeriStar Material Adverse Effect.

         4.8      ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except for (i) matters
disclosed in the MeriStar SEC Documents or on Schedule 4.8 to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter, (ii) the Transactions and the dividends and distributions
contemplated by Section 2.2(c), and (iii) the transactions permitted by Section
6.3, since the date of the most recent audited financial statements included in
the MeriStar SEC Documents (the "MeriStar Financial Statement Date"), MeriStar
and the MeriStar Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in the ordinary
and normal course (taking into account prior practices, including the
acquisition of properties and issuance of securities) and there has not been,
from the MeriStar Financial Statement Date through the date of this Agreement,
(a) any material adverse change in the business, financial condition or results
of operations of MeriStar and the MeriStar Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
including, without limitation, any increase in market rates of interest and
related costs of financing which results in yields for new issues of unsecured
senior notes issued by companies with a comparable debt rating to FelCor and
MeriStar exceeding an amount which the members of the Interim Transactions
Committee (as defined in Section 6.5) agree, in the exercise of their good faith
business judgment, makes the issuance of such debt not economically prudent (a
"MeriStar Material Adverse Change"), (b) any occurrence or circumstance that
with the passage of time would reasonably be expected to result in a MeriStar
Material Adverse Change, or (c) any action taken by MeriStar or any MeriStar
Subsidiary during the period from the MeriStar Financial Statement Date through
the date of this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of Section
6.3.

         4.9      LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in the MeriStar SEC Documents
or in Schedule 4.9 to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter, and other than personal
injury and other routine tort litigation arising from the ordinary course of

therefrom are reimbursable pursuant to common area maintenance or similar
agreements, there is no suit, action or proceeding pending (in which service of
process has been received by an employee or agent of MeriStar or any MeriStar
Subsidiary) or, to the Knowledge of MeriStar, threatened in writing against or
affecting MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a MeriStar Material Adverse
Effect or to prohibit, restrict or interfere with the consummation of any of the
Transactions, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of

effect as title insurance policies) have been issued by national title insurance
companies insuring the fee simple or leasehold, as applicable, title of MeriStar
or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to each of the MeriStar Properties in
amounts at least equal to the portion of the purchase price thereof allocated to
real estate (the "MeriStar Title Policies"), and, to MeriStar's Knowledge, the
MeriStar Title Policies are valid and in full force and effect and no claim has
been made under any such policy (except claims which have previously been fully
resolved).

         (b)      Except as set forth in Schedule 4.10(b) to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter, and except for matters which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a MeriStar Material Adverse Effect
or to materially and adversely affect the use or occupancy (or, if applicable,
any proposed development) of the MeriStar Properties, MeriStar has no Knowledge
that any currently required certificate, permit or license (including building
permits and certificates of occupancy) from any Governmental Entity having
jurisdiction over any MeriStar Property or any agreement, easement or other
right which is necessary to permit the lawful use, occupancy or operation of the
existing buildings, structures or other improvements which constitute a part of
any of the MeriStar Properties has not been obtained or is not in full force and

Disclosure Letter, none of the MeriStar Properties is subject to any outstanding
purchase option, right of first refusal, right of first offer or similar right,
other than such rights as would not reasonably be expected to have a MeriStar
Material Adverse Effect, nor has MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary entered
into any outstanding contracts with others for the sale, mortgage, pledge,
hypothecation, assignment, sublease or lease of any material portion of any
MeriStar Property or other transfer of all or any material part of any MeriStar
Property as of the date hereof, which are scheduled to close or be consummated
after the date hereof, and no Person has any right or option to acquire, or
right of first refusal or right of first offer with respect to, any interest of
MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary in any MeriStar Property or any material
part thereof.

         (e)      Schedule 4.10(e) to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter sets forth
the capital expenditure budget and schedule of MeriStar and each MeriStar
Subsidiary for each MeriStar Property, describing the capital expenditures which
MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary has budgeted for such MeriStar Property for
the period running through December 31, 2001 (the "MeriStar Budget and

the MeriStar Disclosure Letter. Each of the MeriStar Ground Leases is valid,
binding and in full force and effect as against MeriStar or any MeriStar
Subsidiary and, to MeriStar's Knowledge, as against the other party thereto,
except to the extent the failure to be binding and in full force and effect
would not reasonably be expected to have a MeriStar Material Adverse Effect.
There does not exist under any of the MeriStar Ground Leases any default, and,
to MeriStar's Knowledge, no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute such a default, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a MeriStar Material
Adverse Effect.

         (g)      Schedule 4.10(g) to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter sets forth
a list of the hotel franchise, license or other agreements relating to the
names, marks or systems (the "MeriStar Franchise Agreements") under which each
of the MeriStar Properties is being operated. Each of the MeriStar Franchise
Agreements is in full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of MeriStar, there
are no defaults thereunder by either party thereto, nor have any events occurred
which, with the giving notice or the passage of time or both would constitute a
default or event of default thereunder, except for those which either
individually or in the aggregate would not constitute a MeriStar Material
Adverse Effect.

         (h)      Schedule 4.10(h) to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter sets forth

any events occurred which, with the giving notice or the passage of time or both
would constitute a default or event of default thereunder, except for those
which either individually or in the aggregate would not constitute a MeriStar
Material Adverse Effect.

aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a MeriStar Material Adverse
Effect, (a) each MeriStar Benefit Plan and any related trust intended to be
qualified under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code has received a favorable

of MeriStar, nothing has occurred since the date of such letter that could
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the qualified status of
such MeriStar Benefit Plan or related trust, (b) each MeriStar Benefit Plan has
been operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with the
terms and requirements of applicable law and all required returns and filings
for each MeriStar Benefit Plan have been timely made, (c) neither MeriStar nor

liability imposed under ERISA (defined below), the Code or other applicable
laws, rules and regulations, in connection with any MeriStar Benefit Plan, and
no administrative investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding by the
Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Internal

liability, (d) all contributions due and payable on or before the date hereof in
respect of each MeriStar Benefit Plan have been made in full and in proper form,
(e) neither MeriStar nor any MeriStar Subsidiary has ever sponsored or been
obligated to contribute to any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA), any plan subject to Section 413 of the Code, or any "defined benefit

any MeriStar Subsidiary has any present or future right to benefits sponsored or
maintained by

                                       21

<PAGE>

MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary or under which MeriStar or any MeriStar
Subsidiary has had or has any present or could reasonably be expected to have
any future liability. All such plans, agreements, programs, policies and
arrangements shall be collectively referred to as the "MeriStar Benefit Plans."

current, accurate and complete copy (or, to the extent no such copy exists, an
accurate description) thereof and, to the extent applicable: (i) any related
trust agreement or other funding instrument; (ii) the most recent determination
letter, if applicable; (iii) any summary plan description and other written
communications (or a description of any oral communications) by MeriStar or any

         4.12     LABOR MATTERS; EMPLOYEES.

         (a)      Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12(a) to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter, neither MeriStar nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,
or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or
understanding with a labor union or labor union organization. MeriStar has
delivered true, correct and complete copies of such agreements to the FelCor
Parties. There is no unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceeding
pending or, to MeriStar's Knowledge, threatened against MeriStar or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to their business which, if determined adversely to
MeriStar or any of its Subsidiaries, would have a MeriStar Material Adverse
Effect.

         (b)      Schedule 4.12(b) to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter sets forth
all employment agreements between MeriStar or any of its Subsidiaries and any
other Person.

         (c)      Neither MeriStar, nor any MeriStar Subsidiary, is delinquent
in payments to any of its employees or consultants for any wages, salaries,
commissions, bonuses, benefits or other compensation for any services or
otherwise arising under any policy, practice, agreement, plan, program or Law,
which delinquency would, in the aggregate, have a MeriStar Material Adverse
Effect. None of MeriStar's or any MeriStar Subsidiary's employment policies or
practices is currently being audited or investigated by any Governmental Entity
or court. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of MeriStar, threatened
litigation, unfair labor practice charge, or other charge or inquiry against
MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary brought by or on behalf of any employee,
prospective employee, former employee, retiree, labor organization or other
representative of any of them with respect to employment practices which could
reasonably be expected to have a MeriStar Material Adverse Effect.

         (d)      Neither MeriStar nor any MeriStar Subsidiary is a party to, or
otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation or other order by, any
Governmental Entity relating to employees or employment practices. MeriStar and
each MeriStar Subsidiary are in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws, Contracts, and policies relating to employment, employment
practices, wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, including the
obligations of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification

Act of 1988, as amended ("WARN"), and has not planned or implemented any early
retirement, separation or window program within the past five years.

         4.13     TAXES.

         (a)      Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13(a) to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter, each of MeriStar and the MeriStar Subsidiaries has timely
filed or caused to be timely filed all material Tax Returns (as defined below)
required to be filed by it and for any partnerships for which any of them is a
general partner (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by
a Governmental Entity having authority to do so) and has paid (or MeriStar has
paid on its behalf) all Taxes (as defined below) required to be paid as shown on
such returns and all such Tax Returns were, when filed, complete and accurate in
all material respects, except where the failure to file such Tax Returns, the
failure to pay such Taxes and the failure of such Tax Returns to be complete and
accurate in all material respects could not be reasonably expected to have a
MeriStar Material Adverse Effect. No material deficiencies for any Taxes have
been or are currently being proposed, asserted or assessed in writing, or to the
Knowledge of MeriStar, threatened in writing by any taxing authority against
MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary. Neither MeriStar nor a MeriStar Subsidiary
has executed or filed with any taxing authority any agreement now in effect
extending the period for assessment of Taxes. No Tax Returns of MeriStar or any
MeriStar Subsidiary have been or are currently being audited by any applicable
taxing authority, and neither MeriStar nor any MeriStar Subsidiary has received
any written notice that such audit is contemplated. There are no material Tax
liens on any properties of MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary other than liens
for current Taxes not yet due and payable. The most recent audited financial
statements contained in the MeriStar SEC Documents reflect an adequate accrual
in accordance with GAAP for all Taxes and deferred Taxes payable by MeriStar and
its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date
of such financial statements. Except as would not have a MeriStar Material
Adverse Effect, MeriStar and each MeriStar Subsidiary have complied with all
applicable Laws relating to the payment, collection, withholding and deposit, as
the case may be, of Taxes and, to the extent required, have paid over to the
appropriate governmental authorities or are properly holding for such payment
all taxes, unemployment insurance and other amounts required by law to be
withheld or collected.

         (b)      MeriStar is not required to include in income any amount for
an adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code, and except as set forth on
Schedule 4.13(b) to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter, is neither a party to nor
obligated under any agreement or other arrangement providing for the payment of
any amount that is not or would not be deductible by MeriStar by reason of
Section 280G of the Code or Section 162(m) of the Code.

         (c)      Neither MeriStar nor any MeriStar Subsidiary has taken or will
take any action that would create a material risk that the Merger would not
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         (d)      Neither MeriStar nor any MeriStar Subsidiary is a party to or
has any obligation under any Tax sharing agreements or similar contract or
arrangement that would have a MeriStar Material Adverse Effect. No closing
agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of

                                       23

<PAGE>

the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) has been
entered into by MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary that would have a MeriStar
Material Adverse Effect.

         (e)      Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13(e) to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter, neither MeriStar nor any MeriStar Subsidiary has any material
liability for Taxes of any Person under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, by contract or otherwise, that would have a MeriStar Material Adverse
Effect.

         (f)      Since the MeriStar Financial Statement Date, (i) MeriStar has
incurred no material liability for Taxes under Section 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of
the Code, including, without limitation, any Tax arising from a prohibited
transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and (ii) neither
MeriStar nor a MeriStar Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes
other than in the ordinary course of business except where such liability for
Taxes could not reasonably be expected to have a MeriStar Material Adverse
Effect. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which
presents a material risk that any material Tax described in this paragraph (f)
will be imposed upon MeriStar.

         (g)      MeriStar or its predecessors (other than CapStar Hotel
Company) (i) for all taxable years commencing with its taxable year beginning
July 31, 1996 and ended December 31, 1996, and through December 31, 2000 has
been subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within the meaning of
Section 856 of the Code (a "REIT") and has satisfied all requirements to qualify
as a REIT for such years, and (ii) has operated, and intends to continue to
operate, in such manner as to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending at
the Effective Time. To MeriStar's Knowledge, no action, proceeding or
investigation that could reasonably be expected to result in the termination of
MeriStar's status as a REIT has been taken or omitted or is pending or
threatened.

         (h)      Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13(h) to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter, MeriStar has not made an election under IRS Notice 88-19 or
Temporary Treasury Regulations Section 1.337(d)-5T(b)(3).

         (i)      Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13(i) to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter, each of MeriStar OP and each other subsidiary of MeriStar
that is organized as a partnership, limited liability company or trust
(including entities in which MeriStar directly or indirectly owns less than 50%
of the equity ownership interests) has been at all times since August 3, 1998,
and will be through the Closing Date, treated for federal income tax purposes as
either (i) a partnership that is not either an association taxable as a
corporation or a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Code,
(ii) a publicly traded partnership that is eligible for partnership status under
Section 7704(c) of the Code, or (iii) a disregarded entity.

         (j)      Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13(j) to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter, each of the corporations in which MeriStar owns a direct or
indirect equity ownership interest has been at all times since August 3, 1998,
and through the Closing Date will be, treated for federal income tax purposes as
either (i) a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of

                                       24

<PAGE>

Section 856(i) of the Code or (ii) a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the
meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code.

         (k)      Schedule 4.13(k) to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter sets forth
a list of the entities for which MeriStar has made taxable REIT subsidiary
elections under Section 856(l) and the effective dates of such elections.
MeriStar has made a taxable REIT subsidiary election for each entity that it
intends to treat as a taxable REIT subsidiary for its 2001 taxable year.

         (l)      Except for the agreements or with respect to the transactions
that will be set forth on Schedule 4.13(l) to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter
(such Schedule 4.13(l) to be delivered within 14 business days from the date of
this Agreement), neither MeriStar nor any MeriStar Subsidiary has entered into
or is subject to any "MeriStar Tax Protection Agreements." The MeriStar Parties
represent and warrant that the MeriStar Tax Protection Agreements listed on
Schedule 4.13(l) shall contain only such terms and provisions as are usual and
customary in agreements for similar purposes. As used herein, a MeriStar Tax
Protection Agreement is a written agreement (A) that has as one of its purposes
to permit a Person to take the position that such Person could defer federal
taxable income that otherwise might have been recognized upon a transfer of
property to the MeriStar OP or any other MeriStar Subsidiary that is treated as
a partnership for federal income tax purposes and that as a result of such
purpose (i) prohibits or restricts in any manner the disposition of any assets
of the MeriStar OP or such MeriStar Subsidiary or requires the MeriStar OP or
such MeriStar Subsidiary to indemnify or reimburse any Person for a loss of
federal income tax deferral as a result of any such asset disposition; (ii)
requires that the MeriStar OP or such MeriStar Subsidiary maintain, put in
place, or replace, indebtedness, whether or not secured by one or more of the
MeriStar Properties; or (iii) requires that the MeriStar OP or such MeriStar
Subsidiary offer to any Person at any time the opportunity to guarantee or
otherwise assume, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, through
a "deficit restoration obligation," guarantee (including, without limitation, a
"bottom" guarantee), indemnification agreement, reimbursement agreement or other
similar arrangement), the risk of loss for federal income tax purposes for
indebtedness or other liabilities of the MeriStar OP or such MeriStar
Subsidiary, (B) that specifies or relates to a method of taking into account
book-tax disparities under Section 704(c) of the Code or the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to one or more assets of the
MeriStar OP or such MeriStar Subsidiary or (C) that requires a particular method
for allocating one or more liabilities of MeriStar or such MeriStar Subsidiary
under Section 752 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. Except as would not have a MeriStar Material Adverse Effect, neither
MeriStar nor any MeriStar Subsidiary is in violation of or in default under any
MeriStar Tax Protection Agreement.

         (m)      As used in this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" means any federal,
state, local, or foreign income, gross receipts, license, payroll, employment,
excise, severance, stamp, occupation, premium, windfall profits, environmental
(including taxes under Section 59A of the Code), customs duties, capital stock,
franchise, profits, withholding, social security (or similar), unemployment,
disability, real property, personal property, sales, use, transfer,
registration, value added, alternative or add-on minimum, estimated, or other
tax of any kind

                                       25

whatsoever, including any interest, penalty, or addition thereto, whether
disputed or not. "Tax Returns" means any return, declaration, report, claim for
refund, or information return or statement relating to Taxes, including any
schedule or attachment thereto, and including any amendment thereof.

         4.14     NO PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS. Except as
disclosed on Schedule 4.14 to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter, there are no cash
or non-cash payments which will become payable to any employee, officer or
director of MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary as a result of the Merger and
the Transactions, and there is no employment or severance contract, or other
agreement requiring payments, cancellation of indebtedness or other obligation
to be made upon a change of control or otherwise as a result of the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with respect to any
employee, officer or director of MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary.

         4.15     BROKERS, FEES AND EXPENSES. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other person, other than Salomon Smith Barney Inc., the
fees and expenses of which are as described in the engagement letter between
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and MeriStar, a true and correct copy of which has
previously been delivered to the FelCor Parties, is entitled to any broker's,
finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary.

         4.16     CONTRACTS; DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

         (a)      Except as set forth in Schedule 4.16(a) to the MeriStar
Disclosure Letter, and except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a MeriStar Material Adverse Effect, neither MeriStar nor any MeriStar
Subsidiary has received a written notice that MeriStar or any MeriStar
Subsidiary is in violation of or in default under (nor to the Knowledge of
MeriStar does there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the
giving of notice or both would cause such a violation of or default under) any
loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, permit,
concession, franchise, license or any other contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding, to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or
assets is bound, nor to the Knowledge of MeriStar does such a violation or
default exist.

         (b)      Except for any of the following expressly identified in
MeriStar SEC Documents, Schedule 4.16(b) to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter sets
forth a list of each loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture
and any other agreement and instrument pursuant to which any Indebtedness (as
defined below) in excess of $10,000,000 of MeriStar or of any MeriStar
Subsidiary, other than such Indebtedness payable to MeriStar or a MeriStar
Subsidiary, is outstanding or may be incurred. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Indebtedness" shall mean (i) indebtedness for borrowed money, whether secured
or unsecured, (ii) obligations under conditional sale or other title retention
agreements relating to property purchased by such Person, (iii) capitalized
lease obligations, (iv) obligations under interest rate cap, swap, collar or
similar transactions or currency hedging transactions (valued at the termination
value thereof), and (v) guarantees of any such Indebtedness of any other Person.

disclosed in the MeriStar SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, none of MeriStar, any of the MeriStar Subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of MeriStar, any other Person has caused or permitted (a) the unlawful
presence of any Hazardous Materials (as defined below) on any of the MeriStar
Properties or properties formerly owned by MeriStar or (b) any unlawful spills,
releases, discharges or disposal of Hazardous Materials to have occurred on
MeriStar Properties or properties formerly owned by MeriStar or be presently

         Except as set forth in the letter of even date herewith signed by the
Chairman of the Board or President of FelCor and delivered to the MeriStar
Parties prior to the execution hereof (the "FelCor Disclosure Letter"), the
FelCor Parties, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the MeriStar
Parties as follows:

         5.1     ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND POWER OF FELCOR. FelCor is a
corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of
Maryland, having the requisite corporate power to carry on its business as now
being conducted. FelCor is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets,
financial condition or results of operations of FelCor and the FelCor
Subsidiaries (as defined below), taken as a whole, or the ability of the FelCor
Parties to perform any of their respective substantive obligations under this
Agreement (any such effect a "FelCor Material Adverse Effect"). FelCor has
delivered to the MeriStar Parties complete and correct copies of the FelCor
Charter and the FelCor Bylaws.

         5.2      FELCOR SUBSIDIARIES.

partner interest in FelCor OP, constituting all of the general partner interests
in FelCor OP. All of the FelCor OP Units

                                       29

<PAGE>

owned by FelCor and FelCor LLC, the general partner interest in FelCor OP owned
by FelCor, and the issued and outstanding membership interests in FelCor LLC
owned by FelCor, are free and clear of all Liens, other than those listed on
Schedule 5.2(a) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter. The FelCor OP Units are validly
issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable. Schedule 5.2(a) to the
FelCor Disclosure Letter sets forth the name of each holder of a FelCor OP Unit
(each a "FelCor OP Unit Holder") and the number and type of FelCor OP Units

Agreement. The FelCor OP Units are subject to no restriction except as set forth
in the FelCor OP limited partnership agreement (the "FelCor Operating
Partnership Agreement") and pursuant to applicable securities laws. FelCor OP
has not issued or granted and is not a party to any outstanding commitments of
any kind relating to, or any presently effective agreements or understandings
with respect to, interests in FelCor OP, whether issued or unissued, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for interests in FelCor OP or
preemptive rights to purchase or rights of first refusal with respect to such
interests. Except as listed on Schedule 5.2(a) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter,
no FelCor OP Units, or other interests therein, have been authorized or reserved
for issuance to anyone other than FelCor LLC or FelCor.

         (b)      Schedule 5.2(b) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter sets forth (i)
each Subsidiary of FelCor (the "FelCor Subsidiary" or "FelCor Subsidiaries"),
(ii) the ownership interest therein of FelCor, (iii) if not wholly-owned by

FelCor Subsidiary, (iv) each hotel (identified by name and location) and other

constituting a FelCor Subsidiary in which FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary holds
an ownership interest, indicating the name, nature and business of such entity
and the ownership interest therein held by each FelCor Subsidiary and each other
Person.

         (c)      Except as set forth in Schedule 5.2(c) to the FelCor

incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry on
its business as now being conducted, and each FelCor Subsidiary that is a
partnership, limited liability company, trust or joint venture is duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has
the requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now being

and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a FelCor
Material Adverse Effect. Copies of the articles or certificates of
incorporation, bylaws, organizational documents and partnership, joint venture
and operating agreements of each FelCor Subsidiary, in each case as amended to
the date of this Agreement, have been previously delivered or made available

                                       30

to the MeriStar Parties. Neither FelCor nor any of the FelCor Subsidiaries is in
breach of any provision of any agreement, document or contract governing its
rights in or to the interests owned or held by it other than breaches, which
could not reasonably be expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of FelCor (as defined in Section 5.21), the other parties to such
agreements, documents or contracts are not in breach of any of their respective
obligations under such agreements, documents or contracts other than breaches,
which could not reasonably be expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect.

         5.6      SEC DOCUMENTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.
FelCor has filed all required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents with the SEC since July 28, 1994 through the date hereof (the "FelCor
SEC Documents"). All of the FelCor SEC Documents (other than preliminary
material), as of their respective filing dates, complied in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
applicable to such FelCor SEC Documents. None of the FelCor SEC Documents (other
than preliminary materials) at the time of filing contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent
such statements have been modified or superseded by later FelCor SEC Documents
filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement. The
consolidated financial statements of FelCor and the FelCor Subsidiaries included
in the FelCor SEC Documents complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented, in accordance with the applicable requirements of GAAP and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the consolidated financial
position, as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments) of FelCor and the FelCor
Subsidiaries. Except for liabilities and obligations set forth in the FelCor SEC
Documents or in Schedule 5.6 to the FelCor Disclosure Letter, neither FelCor nor
any FelCor Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which are required by GAAP to be set
forth on a consolidated balance sheet of FelCor or in the notes thereto and
which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a FelCor Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.7      ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except for (i) matters
disclosed in the FelCor SEC Documents or in Schedule 5.7 to the FelCor
Disclosure Letter, and (ii) the Transactions and the dividends and distributions
contemplated by Section 2.2(c), and (iii) the transactions permitted by Section
6.4, since the date of the most recent audited financial statements included in
the FelCor SEC Documents (the "FelCor Financial Statement Date"), FelCor and the
FelCor Subsidiaries have conducted their business only in the ordinary and
normal course (taking into account prior practices, including the acquisition of
properties and issuance of securities) and there has not been, from the FelCor
Financial Statement Date through the date of this Agreement, (a) any material
adverse change in the business, financial condition or results of operations of
FelCor and the FelCor Subsidiaries taken as a whole, including, without
limitation, any increase in market rates of interest and related costs of
financing which results in yields for new issues of unsecured senior notes
issued by companies with a comparable debt rating to FelCor and MeriStar
exceeding an amount which the members of the Interim Transactions Committee (as
defined in Section 6.5) agree, in the exercise of their good faith business
judgment, makes the issuance of such debt not economically prudent (a "FelCor
Material Adverse Change"), (b) any occurrence or circumstance that with the
passage of time would reasonably be expected to result in

                                       34

<PAGE>

a FelCor Material Adverse Change, or (c) any action taken by FelCor or any
FelCor Subsidiary during the period from the FelCor Financial Statement Date
through the date of this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of
Section 6.4.

         5.8      LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in the FelCor SEC Documents or
in Schedule 5.8 to the FelCor Disclosure Letter, and other than personal injury
and other routine tort litigation arising from the ordinary course of operations
of FelCor and the FelCor Subsidiaries (a) which are covered by adequate
insurance or (b) for which all material costs and liabilities arising therefrom
are reimbursable pursuant to common area maintenance or similar agreements,
there is no suit, action or proceeding pending (in which service of process has
been received by an employee or agent of FelCor or a FelCor Subsidiary) or, to
the Knowledge of FelCor, threatened in writing against or affecting FelCor or
any FelCor Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
be expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect or to prohibit, restrict or
interfere with the consummation of any of the Transactions, nor is there any
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary having, or which,
insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future could have, any such
Effect.

complete and accurate list and the address of all real property owned or leased

each address referenced in Schedule 5.9(a) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter and
all buildings, structures and other improvements and fixtures located on or
under such land and all easements, rights and other appurtenances to such land,
the "FelCor Properties"). FelCor or the FelCor Subsidiaries, owns or own, as the

or for which no disclosure is required by Section 5.14(b), the Lien of real
estate taxes not yet due and payable and such Encumbrances as individually, and
in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a FelCor Material
Adverse Effect. Except for such of the following as individually, or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse
Effect, policies of title insurance (or marked title insurance commitments
having the same force and effect as title insurance policies) have been issued
by national title insurance companies insuring the fee simple or leasehold, as
applicable, title of FelCor or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to each of the
FelCor Properties in amounts at least equal to the portion of the purchase price
thereof allocated to real estate (the "FelCor Title Policies"), and, to FelCor's
Knowledge, the FelCor Title Policies are valid and in full force and effect and
no claim has been made under any such policy (except claims which have
previously been fully resolved).

         (b)      Except as set forth in Schedule 5.9(b) to the FelCor
Disclosure Letter, and except for matters which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect
or to materially and adversely affect the use or

occupancy (or, if applicable, any proposed development) of the FelCor
Properties, FelCor has no Knowledge that any currently required certificate,
permit or license (including building permits and certificates of occupancy)
from any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any FelCor Property or any
agreement, easement or other right which is necessary to permit the lawful use,
occupancy or operation of the existing buildings, structures or other
improvements which constitute a part of any of the FelCor Properties has not
been obtained or is not in full force and effect, or of any pending modification
or cancellation of any of the same.

         (c)      Schedule 5.9(c) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all definitive agreements made or entered into by
FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary as of the date hereof, which are scheduled to
close or be consummated after the date hereof, (x) to sell, mortgage, pledge,
hypothecate, lease or sublease any FelCor Property, which, individually or in
the aggregate, are material, (y) to enter into a material transaction in respect
of the ownership or financing of any FelCor Property, or (z) to purchase, lease
or otherwise acquire any real property.

         (d)      Except as set forth in Schedule 5.9(d) to the FelCor
Disclosure Letter, none of the FelCor Properties is subject to any outstanding
purchase option, right of first refusal, right of first offer or similar right
other than such rights as would not reasonably be expected to have a FelCor
Material Adverse Effect, nor has FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary entered into
any outstanding contracts with others for the sale, mortgage, pledge,
hypothecation, assignment, sublease or lease of any material portion of any
FelCor Property or other transfer of all or any part of any FelCor Property as
of the date hereof, which are scheduled to close or be consummated after the
date hereof, and no Person has any right or option to acquire, or right of first
refusal or right of first offer with respect to, any interest of FelCor or any
FelCor Subsidiary in any FelCor Property or any material part thereof.

         (e)      Schedule 5.9(e) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter sets forth the
capital expenditure budget and schedule of FelCor and each FelCor Subsidiary for
each FelCor Property, describing the capital expenditures which FelCor or any
FelCor Subsidiary has budgeted for such FelCor Property for the period running
through December 31, 2001 (the "FelCor Budget and Schedule").

         (f)      The ground leases underlying the leased FelCor Properties
(collectively, the "FelCor Ground Leases") are listed on Schedule 5.9(f) to the
FelCor Disclosure Letter. Each of the FelCor Ground Leases is valid, binding and
in full force and effect as against FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary and, to
FelCor's Knowledge, as against the other party thereto, except to the extent the
failure to be binding and in full force and effect would not reasonably be
expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect. There does not exist under
any of the FelCor Ground Leases any default, and, to FelCor's Knowledge, no
event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute
such a default, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a FelCor Material Adverse Effect.

         (g)      Schedule 5.9(g) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of the hotel franchise, license or other agreements relating to the names,
marks or systems (the "FelCor

<PAGE>

Franchise Agreements") under which each of the FelCor Properties is being
operated. Each of the FelCor Franchise Agreements is in full force and effect
and, to the Knowledge of FelCor, there are no defaults thereunder by either
party thereto, nor have any events occurred which, with the giving of notice or
the passage of time or both, would constitute a default or event of default
thereunder, except for those which either individually or in the aggregate would
not constitute a FelCor Material Adverse Effect.

         (h)      Schedule 5.9(h) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of the hotel management agreements (the "FelCor Management Agreements")
pursuant to which each of the FelCor Properties is being managed. Each of the
FelCor Management Agreements is in full force and effect and, to the Knowledge
of FelCor, there are no defaults thereunder by either party thereto, nor have
any events occurred which, with the giving notice or the passage of time or both
would constitute a default or event of default thereunder, except for those
which either individually or in the aggregate would not constitute a FelCor
Material Adverse Effect.

         5.10     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; LABOR MATTERS.

except for such matters, as, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect, (a) each FelCor
Benefit Plan and any related trust intended to be qualified under Sections
401(a) and 501(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from

any such material liability, (d) all contributions due and payable on or before
the date hereof in respect of each FelCor Benefit Plan have been made in full
and in proper form, (e) neither FelCor nor any FelCor Subsidiary has ever
sponsored or been obligated to contribute to any "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), any plan subject to Section 413 of the Code
or any "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA), (f) except

<PAGE>

benefit or amount payable, or which may become payable in connection with the
Transactions by FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary pursuant to any FelCor Benefit
Plan, agreement or contract with any employee, constitutes an "excess parachute
payment" which would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code.
Schedule 5.10 to the FelCor Disclosure Letter contains a complete list of each
"employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, excluding
"multiemployer plans" within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)), and all stock
purchase, stock option, severance, employment, change-in-control, fringe
benefit, collective bargaining, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation and all
other employee benefit plans, agreements, programs, policies or other
arrangements, whether or not subject to ERISA (including any funding mechanism
therefor now in effect or required in the future as a result of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise), whether formal or informal, oral
or written, legally binding or not, under which any current or former employee,
officer or director of FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary has any present or future
right to benefits sponsored or maintained by FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary or
under which FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary has had or has any present or could
reasonably be expected to have any future liability. All such plans, agreements,
programs, policies and arrangements shall be collectively referred to as the
"FelCor Benefit Plans." With respect to each FelCor Benefit Plan, FelCor has
provided to MeriStar a current, accurate and complete copy (or, to the extent no
such copy exists, an accurate description) thereof and, to the extent
applicable: (i) any related trust agreement or other funding instrument; (ii)
the most recent determination letter, if applicable; (iii) any summary plan

information.

         (b)      Neither FelCor, nor any FelCor Subsidiary, is delinquent in
payments to any of its employees or consultants for any wages, salaries,
commissions, bonuses, benefits or other compensation for any services or
otherwise arising under any policy, practice, agreement, plan, program or Law,
which delinquency would, in the aggregate, have a FelCor Material Adverse
Effect. None of FelCor's or any FelCor Subsidiary's employment policies or
practices is currently being audited or investigated by any Governmental Entity
or court. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of FelCor, threatened
litigation, unfair labor practice charge, or other charge or inquiry against
FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary brought by or on behalf of any employee,
prospective employee, former employee, retiree, labor organization or other
representative of any of them with respect to employment practices which could
reasonably be expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect.

         (c)      Neither FelCor nor any FelCor Subsidiary is a party to, or

practices, wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, including the
obligations of the WARN, and has not planned or implemented any early

         5.11     TAXES.

         (a)      Each of FelCor and the FelCor Subsidiaries has timely filed or
caused to be timely filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it
and for any partnerships for which any of them is a general partner (after
giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity
having authority to do so) and has paid (or FelCor has paid on its behalf) all
Taxes required to be paid as shown on such returns and all such Tax Returns
were, when filed, complete and accurate in all material respects, except where
the failure to file such Tax Returns, the failure to pay such Taxes and the
failure of such Tax Returns to be complete and accurate in all material respects
could not be reasonably expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect. No
material deficiencies for any Taxes have been or are currently being proposed,
asserted or assessed in writing, or to the Knowledge of FelCor, threatened in
writing by any taxing authority against FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary. Neither
FelCor nor a FelCor Subsidiary has executed or filed with any taxing authority
any agreement now in effect extending the period for assessment of Taxes. No Tax
Returns of FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary have been or are currently being
audited by any applicable taxing authority, and neither FelCor nor any FelCor
Subsidiary has received any written notice that such audit is contemplated.
There are no material Tax liens on any properties of FelCor or any FelCor
Subsidiary other than liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable. The most
recent audited financial statements contained in the FelCor SEC Documents
reflect an adequate accrual in accordance with GAAP for all Taxes and deferred
Taxes payable by FelCor and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and
portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Except as would
not have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect, FelCor and each FelCor Subsidiary
have complied with all applicable Laws relating to the payment, collection,
withholding and deposit, as the case may be, of Taxes and, to the extent
required, have paid over to the appropriate governmental authorities or are
properly holding for such payment all taxes, unemployment insurance and other
amounts required by law to be withheld or collected.

         (b)      FelCor is not required to include in income any amount for an
adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code, and except as set forth on
Schedule 5.11(b) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter, is neither a party to nor
obligated under any agreement or other arrangement providing for the payment of
any amount that is not or would not be deductible by FelCor by reason of Section
280G of the Code or Section 162(m) of the Code.

         (c)      Neither FelCor nor any FelCor Subsidiary has taken or will
take any action that would create a material risk that the Merger would not
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         (d)      Neither FelCor nor any FelCor Subsidiary is a party to or has
any obligation under any Tax sharing agreements or similar contract or
arrangement that would have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect. No closing
agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law) has been entered into by FelCor or any FelCor
Subsidiary that would have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect.

         (e)      Except as set forth on Schedule 5.11(e) to the FelCor
Disclosure Letter, neither FelCor nor any FelCor Subsidiary has any material
liability for Taxes of any Person

                                       39

<PAGE>

under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise,
that would have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect.

         (f)      Since the FelCor Financial Statement Date, (i) FelCor has
incurred no material liability for Taxes under Section 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of
the Code, including, without limitation, any Tax arising from a prohibited
transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and (ii) neither FelCor
nor a FelCor Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than
in the ordinary course of business except where such liability for Taxes could
not reasonably be expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect. No event
has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material
risk that any material Tax described in this paragraph (f) will be imposed upon
FelCor.

         (g)      FelCor (i) for all taxable years commencing with its taxable
year beginning July 28, 1994, and ended December 31, 1994, and through December
31, 2000, has been subject to taxation as a REIT and has satisfied all
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, and (ii) has operated, and
intends to continue to operate, in such manner as to qualify as a REIT for the
taxable year ending December 31, 2001 and subsequent taxable years. To FelCor's
Knowledge, no action, proceeding or investigation that could reasonably be
expected to result in the termination of FelCor's status as a REIT has been
taken or omitted or is pending or threatened.

         (h)      Except as set forth on Schedule 5.11(h) to the FelCor
Disclosure Letter, each of FelCor OP and each other subsidiary of FelCor that is
organized as a partnership, limited liability company or trust (including
entities in which FelCor directly or indirectly owns less than 50% of the equity
ownership interests) has been at all times since the date of its formation, and
will be through the Closing Date, treated for federal income tax purposes as
either (i) a partnership that is not either an association taxable as a
corporation or a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Code,
(ii) a publicly traded partnership that is eligible for partnership status under
Section 7704(c) of the Code or (iii) a disregarded entity.

         (i)      Except as set forth on Schedule 5.11(i) to the FelCor
Disclosure Letter, each of the corporations in which FelCor owns a direct or
indirect equity ownership interest has been at all times since the date of its
formation, and through the Closing Date will be, treated for federal income tax
purposes as either (i) a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of
Section 856(i) of the Code or (ii) a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the
meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code.

         (j)      Schedule 5.11(j) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of the entities for which FelCor has made taxable REIT subsidiary elections
under Section 856(l) and the effective dates of such elections. FelCor has made
a taxable REIT subsidiary election for each entity that it intends to treat as a
taxable REIT subsidiary for its 2001 taxable year.

         (k)      Except as listed on Schedule 5.11(k) to the FelCor Disclosure
Letter, neither FelCor nor any FelCor Subsidiary has entered into or is subject,
directly or indirectly, to any "FelCor Tax Protection Agreements." As used
herein, a FelCor Tax Protection Agreement is an agreement, oral or written, (A)
that has as one of its purposes to permit a Person to take

                                       40

<PAGE>

the position that such Person could defer federal taxable income that otherwise
might have been recognized upon a transfer of property to the FelCor OP or any
other FelCor Subsidiary that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, and that (i) prohibits or restricts in any manner the disposition of
any assets of FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary or requires FelCor or any FelCor
Subsidiary to indemnify or reimburse any Person for a loss of Tax deferral as a
result of any such asset disposition; (ii) requires that FelCor or any FelCor
Subsidiary maintain, put in place, or replace, indebtedness, whether or not
secured by one or more of the FelCor Properties, or (iii) requires that FelCor
or any FelCor Subsidiary offer to any Person at any time the opportunity to
guarantee or otherwise assume, directly or indirectly (including, without
limitation, through a "deficit restoration obligation," guarantee (including,
without limitation, a "bottom" guarantee), indemnification agreement,
reimbursement agreement or other similar arrangement), the risk of loss for
federal income tax purposes for indebtedness or other liabilities of FelCor or
any FelCor Subsidiary, (B) that specifies or relates to a method of taking into
account book-tax disparities under Section 704(c) of the Code or the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to one or more assets of FelCor
or a FelCor Subsidiary, or (C) that requires a particular method for allocating
one or more liabilities of FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary under Section 752 of
the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Except as would not
have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect, neither FelCor nor any FelCor Subsidiary
is in violation of or in default under any FelCor Tax Protection Agreement.

         5.12     NO PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS. Except as set
forth on Schedule 5.12 to the FelCor Disclosure Letter, there are no cash or
non-cash payments which will become payable to any employee, officer or director
of FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary as a result of the Merger and the
Transactions and there is no employment or severance contract, or other
agreement requiring payments, cancellation of indebtedness or other obligation
to be made upon a change of control or otherwise as a result of the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with respect to any
employee, officer or director of FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary.

         5.13     BROKERS, FEES AND EXPENSES. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other person, other than Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc., the fees and expenses of which are as described in their
engagement letters between Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and FelCor, and J.P. Morgan

         (a)      Except as set forth in Schedule 5.14(a) to the FelCor
Disclosure Letter, and except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect, neither FelCor nor any FelCor Subsidiary
has received a written notice that FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary is in
violation of or in default under (nor to the Knowledge of FelCor does there
exist any condition, which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or
both, would cause such a violation of or default under) any loan or credit
agreement, note, bond,

                                       41

<PAGE>

mortgage, indenture, lease, permit, concession, franchise, license or any other
contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding, to which it is a party or by
which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, nor to the Knowledge of
FelCor does such a violation or default exist.

         (b)      Except for any of the following expressly identified in FelCor
SEC Documents, Schedule 5.14(b) to the FelCor Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of each loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture and any
other agreement and instrument pursuant to which any Indebtedness in excess of
$10,000,000 of FelCor or of any FelCor Subsidiary, other than such Indebtedness
payable to FelCor or a FelCor Subsidiary, is outstanding or may be incurred.

         5.15     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect and except as
disclosed in the FelCor SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement,
none of FelCor, any of the FelCor Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of FelCor,
any other Person has caused or permitted (a) the unlawful presence of any
Hazardous Materials on any of the FelCor Properties or properties formerly owned
by FelCor or (b) any unlawful spills, releases, discharges or disposal of
Hazardous Materials to have occurred on FelCor Properties or properties formerly
owned by FelCor or be presently occurring on or from the FelCor Properties,
which presence or occurrence, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
be expected to have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect; and, in connection with
the construction on or operation and use of the FelCor Properties, neither
FelCor nor any FelCor Subsidiary has failed to comply in any material respect
with any applicable Environmental Laws, except to the extent such failure to
comply, individually or in the aggregate, could not be reasonably expected to
have a FelCor Material Adverse Effect. No notice, notification, demand, request
for information, citation, summons, complaint or order has been received by or
is pending, or to the Knowledge of FelCor, is threatened by, any Person against
FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary, other than where such notice, notification,
demand, request for information, citation, summons, complaint or order has been
fully resolved, or, individually and in the aggregate, could not be reasonably
expected to result in a FelCor Material Adverse Effect. FelCor has previously
delivered or made available to MeriStar or its counsel true and complete copies
of all internally prepared or commissioned environmental studies, assessments
and reports in the possession or under the control of FelCor that relate to the
FelCor Properties and/or FelCor 's compliance with Environmental Laws.

         5.16     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Except as disclosed in the FelCor SEC
Documents, neither FelCor nor any FelCor Subsidiary has violated or failed to
comply with any Law, permit, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental

FelCor Material Adverse Effect.

         (a)      MeriStar shall not, nor shall it permit any of the MeriStar
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any officer, director or
employee of or any investment banker, attorney, accountant, agent or other
advisor or representative of MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary to, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of, any MeriStar Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below), (ii) except to the extent permitted by paragraph
(b) enter into any agreement with respect to any MeriStar Acquisition Proposal,
or (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any person any information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may

however, that prior to the MeriStar Stockholder Meeting, to the extent required
by the duties of the Board of Directors of MeriStar under Maryland law, as
determined in good faith by a majority of the disinterested members thereof,
having received the advice of outside counsel, MeriStar may, in response to
unsolicited requests therefor, participate in discussions or negotiations with,
or furnish information pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to,
any Person that makes or expresses a bona fide intention to make an unsolicited
MeriStar Acquisition Proposal, if the Board of Directors of MeriStar first
determines in good faith, based on the vote of a majority of the disinterested
members thereof, that such Person has the ability to consummate a MeriStar
Superior Proposal (as defined below). Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by an officer, director or employee of or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant, agent or other advisor or representative of MeriStar or
any MeriStar Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting to act on
behalf of MeriStar, a MeriStar Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this paragraph by MeriStar. For all purposes of this Agreement,
"MeriStar Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal, other than a proposal by
FelCor or FelCor OP, for a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination or other similar transaction involving MeriStar or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries (as defined below) or any proposal or offer (including,

directly or indirectly, more than a 10% equity interest in any voting securities
of, or 10% or more of the consolidated assets of, MeriStar or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries. MeriStar immediately shall cease and cause to be

MeriStar Acquisition Proposal. For all purposes of this Agreement, a
"Significant Subsidiary" means any Subsidiary that would constitute a
"significant subsidiary" within the meaning of Article 1, Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X of the SEC.

         (b)      Neither the Board of Directors of MeriStar nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify,
in a manner adverse to FelCor or FelCor OP, the approval or recommendation by
the Board of Directors of MeriStar or any committee thereof of this Agreement or
the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any
MeriStar Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of MeriStar, to the extent required by its duties under Maryland law,
as determined in good faith by a majority of the disinterested members thereof,
having received the advice of outside counsel, may approve or recommend (and, in
connection therewith, withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this

or the Merger) a MeriStar Superior Proposal (as defined below). For purposes of
this Agreement, a "MeriStar Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written
proposal made by a third party to acquire MeriStar or any of its Significant
Subsidiaries pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a share exchange,
a sale of all or substantially all of its assets or otherwise, in any such case,
on terms which a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors
of MeriStar determines in their good faith judgment (after consultation with
independent financial advisors) to be more favorable to MeriStar and its
stockholders than the Merger and for which financing, to the extent required, is
then fully committed or which, in the good faith judgment of a majority of such
disinterested members (after consultation with independent financial advisors),
is reasonably capable of being financed by such third party.

         (c)      MeriStar shall promptly advise FelCor orally and in writing of
any MeriStar Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any MeriStar Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such MeriStar Acquisition Proposal or inquiry

inquiry. MeriStar will keep FelCor fully informed of the status and details of
any such MeriStar Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. MeriStar shall give FelCor at
least one day's advance notice of any information to be supplied to, and at
least three days' advance notice of any agreement to be entered into with, any
Person making a MeriStar Acquisition Proposal.

         (d)      Nothing contained in this Section 6.1 will prohibit MeriStar
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
MeriStar's stockholders if the MeriStar Board of Directors determines that such
disclosure is necessary in order to comply with the MeriStar Board of Directors'
duties under Maryland law; provided, however, that neither MeriStar nor the
MeriStar Board of Directors nor any committee thereof may, except in accordance
with Section 6.1(b), withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or
modify, its position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, a MeriStar Acquisition
Proposal.

         6.2      NO SOLICITATION BY FELCOR.

         (a)      FelCor shall not, nor shall it permit any of the FelCor
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any officer, director or

advisor or representative of FelCor or any FelCor Subsidiary to, (i) solicit,

defined below), (ii) except to the extent permitted by paragraph (b), enter into
any agreement with respect to any FelCor Acquisition Proposal, or (iii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate

be expected to lead to, any FelCor Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that
prior to the FelCor Stockholder Meeting, to the extent required by the duties of
the Board of Directors of FelCor under Maryland law, as determined in good faith
by a majority of the disinterested members thereof , having received the advice
of outside counsel, FelCor may, in response to unsolicited requests therefor,

Person that makes or expresses a bona fide intention to make an unsolicited
FelCor Acquisition Proposal, if the Board of Directors of FelCor first
determines in good faith, based on the vote of a majority of the disinterested
members thereof, that such Person has the ability to consummate a FelCor
Superior Proposal (as defined below). Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by an officer, director or employee of or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant, agent or other advisor or representative of FelCor or any
FelCor Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of

paragraph by FelCor. For all purposes of this Agreement, "FelCor Acquisition
Proposal" means any proposal other than a proposal by MeriStar or MeriStar OP,
for a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or other
similar transaction involving FelCor or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or

stockholders of FelCor), other than a proposal or offer by MeriStar or MeriStar
OP, to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, more than a 10% equity
interest in any voting securities of, or 10% or more of the consolidated assets
of, FelCor or any of its Significant Subsidiaries. FelCor immediately shall
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with
any persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any FelCor Acquisition Proposal.

         (b)      Neither the Board of Directors of FelCor nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify,
in a manner adverse to MeriStar or MeriStar OP, the approval or recommendation
by the Board of Directors of FelCor or any committee thereof of this Agreement
or the Merger or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
any FelCor Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of FelCor, to the extent required by its duties under Maryland law, as
determined in good faith by a majority of the disinterested members thereof
having received the advice of outside counsel, may approve or recommend (and, in
connection therewith, withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement or the Merger) a FelCor Superior Proposal (as defined below). For
purposes of this Agreement, a "FelCor Superior Proposal" means a bona fide
written proposal made by a third party to acquire FelCor or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a
share exchange, a sale of all or substantially all of its assets or otherwise,
in any such case, on terms which a majority of the disinterested members of the
Board of Directors of FelCor determines in their good faith judgment (after

and its stockholders than the Merger and for which financing, to the extent
required, is then fully committed or which, in the good faith judgment of a
majority of such disinterested members (after consultation with independent
financial advisors), is reasonably capable of being financed by such third
party.

         (c)      FelCor shall promptly advise MeriStar orally and in writing of

from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
FelCor's stockholders if the FelCor Board of Directors determines that such
disclosure is necessary in order to comply with the FelCor Board of Directors'
duties under Maryland law; provided, however, that neither FelCor nor the FelCor
Board of Directors nor any committee thereof may, except in accordance with
Section 6.2(b), withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify,
its position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or approve or

transfer or otherwise dispose of any FelCor Common Stock issued to such
Affiliate pursuant to the Merger, except pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, in compliance with paragraph (d) of Rule 145
or pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. FelCor shall be entitled to place legends as specified in such written

file the reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, and it will take such further
action as any Affiliate of MeriStar or FelCor may reasonably request, all to the
extent required from time to time to enable such Affiliate to sell shares of
stock of the Surviving Corporation received by such Affiliate in the Merger
without registration under the Securities Act pursuant to (i) Rule 145(d)(1)
under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from to time, or (ii) any
successor rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.

         6.8      OTHER ACTIONS. Each of MeriStar on the one hand and FelCor on
the other hand shall not, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
their respective Subsidiaries not to, take any action that would result in (i)
any of the representations and warranties of such party (without giving effect
to any "knowledge" qualification) set forth in this Agreement that are qualified
as to materiality becoming untrue, (ii) any of such representations and
warranties (without giving effect to any "knowledge" qualification) that are not
so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or (iii) except as
contemplated by Section 6.1 or 6.2 (as the case may be), any of the conditions
to the Merger set forth in Article 8 not being satisfied.

Common Stock issuable in the Merger, a portion of which registration statement
shall also serve as the joint proxy statement with respect to the meetings of
the stockholders of FelCor and MeriStar in connection with the Merger (the
"Proxy Statement"). FelCor shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and
MeriStar shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with FelCor, to
(i) respond to any comments of the SEC and (ii) have the Registration Statement
declared effective under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep

to its respective stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration

                                       52

date its Proxy Statement as of the same date, which shall be the approximate
date of mailing to the stockholders of the respective parties. FelCor will
notify MeriStar promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any
request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement
or the Proxy Statement or for additional information and will supply MeriStar
with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of its
representatives and the SEC, with respect to the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement,
MeriStar or FelCor, as the case may be, shall promptly inform the other of such
occurrences and cooperate in filing with the SEC and/or mailing to the
stockholders of MeriStar or FelCor such amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or Proxy Statement. Each party hereto shall also take
such action as may be reasonably required to cause the shares of FelCor Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger to be registered or to obtain an
exemption from registration under applicable state "blue sky" or securities
laws; provided, however, that no party shall be required to register or qualify
as a foreign corporation or to take other action which would subject it to
general service of process in any jurisdiction where the Surviving Corporation
will not be, following the Merger, so subject. Each of the parties hereto shall
furnish all information concerning itself which is required or customary for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement. The MeriStar
Parties and the FelCor Parties also shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause their respective legal counsel designated in Section 8.1(f), (g) and (h)
to deliver any opinions, which opinions shall be filed as exhibits to the
Registration Statement, addressing federal income tax matters and other matters
as are required to be addressed in the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement under the applicable rules of the SEC. MeriStar OP shall promptly
complete the accounting audit of its financial statements for the 1998, 1999 and
2000 fiscal years so that such financial statements are available for inclusion
in any filings, reports or registration statements (including the Registration
Statement) if and to the extent such inclusion is required under applicable
regulations of the SEC. The information provided by any party hereto for use in
the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement shall be true and correct in all
material respects without omission of any material fact which is required to
make such information not false or misleading. No representation, covenant or
agreement is made by any party hereto with respect to information supplied by
any other party for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement.

         (b)      MeriStar shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
be delivered to FelCor letters of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, dated a date within two
business days before the date of the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement,
and addressed to FelCor, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to FelCor
and customary in scope and substance for "cold comfort" letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection with registration statements on
Form S-4.

         (c)      FelCor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
be delivered to MeriStar a letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P., dated a date
within two business days before the date of the Proxy Statement and Registration
Statement, and addressed to MeriStar, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to MeriStar and customary in scope

                                       53

<PAGE>

and substance for "cold comfort" letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements on Form S-4.

         (d)      MeriStar will, as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold (no sooner than 20
business days following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
stockholders of MeriStar) a meeting of its stockholders (the "MeriStar
Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the MeriStar Stockholder
Approval. MeriStar will, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its
stockholders approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which recommendation shall also be stated in the
Proxy Statement. Prior to the MeriStar Stockholders Meeting, such recommendation
may be withdrawn, modified or amended only in accordance with Section 6.1 of
this Agreement.

         (e)      FelCor will, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold (no sooner than 20
business days following the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
stockholders of FelCor) a meeting of its stockholders (the "FelCor Stockholders
Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the FelCor Stockholder Approval. FelCor
will, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders approval of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which recommendation shall also be stated in the Proxy Statement.
Prior to the FelCor Stockholders Meeting, such recommendation may be withdrawn,
modified or amended only in accordance with Section 6.2 of this Agreement.

         (f)      MeriStar and FelCor shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to hold their respective stockholder meetings on the same day, which day,
subject to the provisions of Section 7.1(d) and 7.1(e), shall be a day not later
than 45 days after the date the Proxy Statement is mailed.

         (g)      If on the date for the MeriStar Stockholders Meeting and the
FelCor Stockholders Meeting established pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and (e),
respectively, either MeriStar or FelCor has not received a sufficient number of
proxies to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then both parties will adjourn their respective
stockholders meetings until the first to occur of (i) the date ten calendar days
after the originally scheduled date of the stockholders meetings or (ii) the
date on which the requisite number of proxies approving this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement has been
obtained.

         7.2      ACCESS TO INFORMATION: CONFIDENTIALITY. Subject to the
requirements of confidentiality agreements with third parties, each of MeriStar
and FelCor shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
other party and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives of such other party, reasonable access during
normal business hours prior to the Effective Time to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, each of MeriStar and FelCor shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b)
all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel

                                       54

<PAGE>

as such other party may reasonably request. Each of MeriStar and FelCor shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives and affiliates to, hold any nonpublic information in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, and will comply
with the provisions of the letter agreement dated as of March 7, 2001 between
MeriStar and FelCor (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are
incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement.

         7.3      REGULATORY MATTERS. Each party hereto shall cooperate and use
its best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to
effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other
documents, and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all governmental
authorities, including, without limitation, the NYSE, National Association of
Securities Dealers or the American Stock Exchange (as applicable), necessary,
proper or appropriate to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         7.4      DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a)      MERISTAR INDEMNIFICATION. From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will provide indemnification for each individual who
is now or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, an officer or director of MeriStar or any MeriStar
Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") which is the same as the indemnification
provided to the Indemnified Parties by MeriStar and the MeriStar Subsidiaries in
the MeriStar Charter and Bylaws or the applicable charter or other
organizational document of such MeriStar Subsidiary, as in effect on the date
hereof; provided, that such indemnification covers actions on or prior to the
Effective Time, including without limitation all transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, whether asserted before, at or after the Effective Time.

         (b)      INSURANCE. The Surviving Corporation shall obtain, at its
expense, so-called "tail insurance" providing for the extension of the directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by MeriStar for six years after the
Closing Date.

         (c)      CONTINUING INDEMNIFICATION. The Surviving Corporation will
continue in force and effect after the Effective Time each indemnification
agreement between MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any
Person, on the other hand, which was in force and effect immediately prior to
the date of this Agreement.

         (d)      SUCCESSORS. In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.4.

<PAGE>

         (e)      BENEFIT. The provisions of this Section 7.4 are intended to be

obligations imposed by law, MeriStar and FelCor will cooperate with each other
in the development and distribution of all news releases and other public
information disclosures with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any public announcement or
statement with respect hereto or thereto without the consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In this regard,
the parties shall comply with the requirements of any applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC, including Regulation FD and Rule 165. To the extent
required by such rules and regulations, the parties shall cooperate to make any
required filings or to issue any required public disclosures thereunder. It is

non-public information of a party obtained by the other party in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, which information is

         (a)      Prior to the Closing Date, FelCor, on behalf of the Surviving
Corporation, shall tender employment agreements or make offers of employment (as
applicable) to the MeriStar employees set forth on Schedule 7.6(a) to the FelCor
Disclosure Letter, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth on
such schedule. FelCor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to tender
offers of employment to other MeriStar employees as determined by FelCor in its
sole discretion.

         (b)      After the Effective Time, FelCor agrees to comply with and pay
the severance and bonus arrangements of former MeriStar or MeriStar OP
employees, as described on Schedule 7.6(b) to the MeriStar Disclosure Letter, if
(i) such employees continue in good faith to perform their duties as employees
through the Closing Date and (ii) except for prorated bonuses paid for the 2001
year, such employees are not employed with the Surviving Corporation or with
MeriStar Hotels & Resorts or their Subsidiaries with substantially the same
compensation and duties as applicable to such employees as of the date hereof.

         7.7      EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

                  (a) MERISTAR BENEFIT PLANS. After the Effective Time, each
employee of MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary who is employed by the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Partnership ("Continuing Employee") shall be
eligible to participate in each FelCor Benefit Plan for which FelCor, in its
sole discretion, determines that such Continuing Employee participated in a
similar MeriStar Benefit Plan, at the level of similarly situated employees of
the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Partnership; provided, however, if
the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Partnership, in its sole discretion,
determines it is not

                                       56

<PAGE>

practicable for such Continuing Employees to participate in one or more FelCor
Benefit Plans as described above, the Surviving Corporation or Surviving
Partnership shall adopt and continue the corresponding MeriStar Benefit Plan,
and continue such Continuing Employee's participation therein, until such time
as the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Partnership determines it is
practicable to include such Continuing Employee in its corresponding FelCor
Benefit Plan; and provided, further, that the Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Partnership may make such adjustments and impose such conditions on
such Continuing Employee's participation in any FelCor Benefit Plan, or
continued MeriStar Benefit Plan, as, in their sole discretion, they shall
reasonably determine as necessary or appropriate to insure that a Continuing
Employee shall not receive a duplicate benefit, or any benefit to which an
employee of FelCor would not have been entitled, under comparable circumstances.
FelCor shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to instruct
MeriStar and any MeriStar Subsidiary (i) to terminate MeriStar's employee stock
purchase plan effective at the end of the current option exercise period
(however denominated in such plan), and (ii) to terminate any one or more
MeriStar Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date effective immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

         (b)      CREDIT FOR PAST SERVICES. Without limitation of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 7.7, each Continuing Employee shall receive credit
for service with MeriStar or any MeriStar Subsidiary, or their predecessors for
purposes of (i) eligibility to participate (including waiting periods and
without being subject to any subsequent entry date requirement for which the
waiting period has already been satisfied), vesting and eligibility to receive
benefits (including without pre-existing conditions limitations) under any
FelCor Benefit Plan, or continued MeriStar Benefit Plan, in which they are
designated by the Surviving Corporation as eligible to participate, and (ii)
benefit accrual under only the severance or vacation pay plan of the Surviving
Corporation or Surviving Partnership in which such Continuing Employee is
designated by the Surviving Corporation or Surviving Partnership as eligible to
participate, if any; and provided, however, that FelCor, in its sole discretion,
may adjust the crediting of service so as to insure that a Continuing Employee
shall not receive a duplicate benefit, or any benefit to which an employee of
FelCor would not have been entitled based on a comparable period of service.
With respect to any FelCor Benefit Plan which is a medical plan or a cafeteria
plan, where a Continuing Employee is designated as eligible to participate in
the corresponding FelCor Benefit Plan(s), the Surviving Corporation and
Surviving Partnership shall cause to be waived any pre-existing condition
limitation to the same extent such pre-existing condition was waived under the
corresponding MeriStar Benefit Plan, and shall give effect, in determining any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, the claims incurred and
amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, such Continuing Employee with
respect to the similar plans maintained by MeriStar or a MeriStar Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, further, and without
limitation, that FelCor, in its sole discretion, may adjust the benefits under
such FelCor Benefit Plan(s) so as to insure that a Continuing Employee shall not
receive a duplicate benefit, or any benefit to which an employee of FelCor would
not have been entitled, under comparable circumstances.

         7.8      STOCK OPTION AND OTHER STOCK PLANS.

                                       57

<PAGE>

         (a)      EXCHANGE OF STOCK OPTIONS. As of the Effective Time, each
option to purchase shares of MeriStar Common Stock (a "MeriStar Stock Option")
which is outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be assumed (or a substitute
option granted) by the Surviving Corporation and shall continue as an option
("Assumed Option") to purchase the number of shares of FelCor Common Stock
(rounded up to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of
MeriStar Common Stock subject to such option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
at an exercise price per share of FelCor Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest penny) equal to the former exercise price per share of MeriStar Common
Stock under such MeriStar Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
minus the Cash Consideration. Each Assumed Option will be in the form determined
by FelCor, and furnished to MeriStar at least 10 days prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the provisions of each such Assumed Option shall not
differ from the provisions of the corresponding MeriStar Stock Option except to
the extent such provisions could have been added, or changed, by amendment under
the terms of the MeriStar Incentive Plan and the MeriStar Stock Option without
the consent of option holders. Without limiting the generality of the forgoing,
FelCor shall not be required to offer employment to an employee of MeriStar, or
MeriStar OP, including, without limitation, a person set forth on Schedule
7.6(a), unless such employee furnishes FelCor with a written waiver, in a form
acceptable to FelCor, of any acceleration in the vesting of his MeriStar Stock
Option(s) which otherwise would occur as a result of the Merger.

         (b)      ADOPTION OF THE MERISTAR INCENTIVE PLAN. In its sole
discretion, and without limiting the generality of the forgoing provisions of
this Section 7.8, FelCor shall have the right to assume the MeriStar Incentive
Plan.

         (c)      OTHER ACTIONS. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver the Assumed Options to the holders
of MeriStar Stock Options upon surrender of the corresponding MeriStar Stock
Options. On, or as soon as practicable after, the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will cause to be filed one or more registration statements on Form
S-3 or Form S-8 under the Securities Act (or any successor or other appropriate
forms), in order to register those shares of FelCor Common Stock subject to
Assumed Options ("Assumed Option Shares") not previously registered, or
post-effective amendments on Form S-3 or Form S-8 to the Registration Statement,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, to describe and cover the Assumed
Option Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall use its best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Assumed
Options remain outstanding. FelCor shall use its best efforts to cause such
registration statements (or post-effective amendments) on Form S-3 to become
effective within 60 days after the date of filing. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of FelCor Common Stock for
delivery in connection with (i) the Assumed Options, (ii) the exchange of
MeriStar OP Units and (iii) the conversion of the outstanding MeriStar
Convertible Notes. The Surviving Corporation shall take all corporate action
necessary or appropriate to obtain stockholder approval with respect to the
Assumed Options to the extent, if any, such approval is required for purposes of
the Code or other applicable law. With respect to the those individuals who
subsequent to the Merger will be

                                       58

<PAGE>

subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to equity securities of the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Corporation shall administer such Assumed Options, where applicable, in a manner
that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

         7.9      REGISTRATION STATEMENTS.

         (a)      SHELF REGISTRATION. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be filed a registration
statement (a "Shelf Registration") on Form S-3 or any other appropriate form
under the Securities Act for an offering to be made on a delayed or continuous
basis pursuant to Rule 415 thereunder or any similar rule that may be adopted by
the SEC and permitting sales in ordinary course brokerage or dealer transactions
not involving an underwritten public offering covering all shares of FelCor
Common Stock issuable after the Effective Time to former holders of MeriStar OP
Units. The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
such Shelf Registration declared effective on or prior to the Closing Date and
remain effective until all shares registered thereunder are sold or are eligible
to be sold under Rule 144(k) promulgated under the Securities Act. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all registration expenses (other than sales commission and
discounts) incurred in connection with the Shelf Registration. In lieu of the
Shelf Registration, if permitted under applicable SEC regulations, FelCor may
elect to include such offering by the former holders of MeriStar OP Units as
part of the Registration Statement.

         (b)      EXCHANGE REGISTRATION. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, each of MeriStar and FelCor shall cause to be filed a registration
statement (an "Exchange Registration") on Form S-4 or any other appropriate form
under the Securities Act, registering the offer to exchange (i) in the case of
MeriStar, $300 million in principal amount of new Series A and Series B 9%
Senior Notes Due 2008 and $200 million in principal amount of new Series C and
Series D 9?% Senior Notes Due 2011, for $300 million in principal amount of
outstanding old Series A and Series B 9% Senior Notes Due 2008 and $200 million
in principal amount of outstanding old Series C and Series D 9?% Senior Notes
Due 2011, in each case, which had been issued without registration under the
Securities Act, and (ii) in the case of FelCor, $100 million in principal amount
of new 9 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2008 for $100 million in principal amount of
outstanding old 9 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2008 which had been issued without
registration under the Securities Act. In each case, MeriStar or FelCor, as
applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have such Exchange
Registration declared effective, and to have its respective exchange offer
completed, on or prior to the Closing Date. Each of MeriStar and FelCor shall
pay all registration expenses incurred in connection with its respective
Exchange Registration.

         7.10     REORGANIZATION STATUS. Each party hereto agrees, as to itself

Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, except as expressly
contemplated or permitted in this Agreement, neither party hereto shall, nor
shall either party hereto permit any of its Subsidiaries or any employees,
officers or directors of such party or of any of its Subsidiaries to, take any
actions which would, or would be reasonably likely to, adversely affect the

the financing to be obtained by the FelCor Parties in order to consummate the

         9.2      CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES.

         (a)      Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement or agreed in
writing by the parties, all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in

by MeriStar an amount equal to the Break-Up Expenses (as defined below). Payment
of any of such amounts shall be made, as directed by MeriStar, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds immediately upon the occurrence of the event
giving rise to the payment of such fee or expenses. The payment of the Break-Up
Fee shall be full compensation for the loss suffered by MeriStar as a result of
the failure of the Merger to be consummated under the circumstances giving rise
to the payment of such fee, and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages
under such circumstances, and neither party shall have any other liability to
the other, other than the payment of the Break-Up Fee, under such circumstances.
The payment of the Break-Up Expenses shall be full compensation for the loss
suffered by MeriStar as the result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated under the circumstances giving rise to the payment of such expenses,
and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages under such circumstances, and
neither party shall have any other liability to the other, other than the
payment of the Break-Up Expenses, under such circumstances.

         (c)      MeriStar agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1(b), (h) or (j), then MeriStar will pay as directed by
FelCor a fee in an amount equal to the Break-Up Fee. In the event of a
termination pursuant to Section 9.1(f), then MeriStar will pay, as directed by
FelCor, an amount equal to the Break-Up Expenses. Payment of any of such amounts

funds immediately upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to payment of
such fee or expenses. The payment of the Break-Up Fee shall be full compensation
for the loss suffered by FelCor as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated under the circumstances giving rise to the payment of such fee, and
to avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances, and
neither party shall have any other liability to the other, other

                                       67

<PAGE>

than the payment of the Break-Up Fee. The payment of the Break-Up Expenses shall

the other, other than the payment of the Break-Up Expenses, under such
circumstances.

         (d)      As used in this Agreement, "Break-Up Fee" shall be an amount
equal to $35 million plus Break-Up Expenses (the "Base Amount"); provided,
however, that such fee shall not exceed the sum of (A) the maximum amount that
can be paid to FelCor or MeriStar, as the case may be (the "Recipient") without
causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code
("Qualifying Income"), as determined by independent accountants to the
Recipient, and (B) in the event the Recipient receives an opinion from outside
counsel (a "Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion") or a ruling from the IRS (a "Break-Up Fee
Ruling"), in either case holding that the Recipient's receipt of the Base Amount
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the "REIT
Requirements") or that the receipt by the Recipient of the remaining balance of
the Base Amount following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling or opinion
would not be deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Base Amount less
the amount payable under clause (A) above; provided, however, that, if the
Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or the Break-Up Fee Ruling is based on the absence of
constructive receipt, the amount that will be paid upon the receipt of the
Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or the Break-Up Fee Ruling will be the maximum amount
that can be paid at that time without causing the Recipient to fail the REIT
Requirements, as determined by the Recipient's independent accountants based on
the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or Break-Up Fee Ruling, and any remaining amount
payable to the Recipient pursuant to clause (B) shall be paid as soon as it
shall be possible to do so without causing the Recipient to fail the REIT
Requirements, as determined by the Recipient's independent accountants based on
the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or Break-Up Fee Ruling. The other party's
obligation to pay (the "Payor") any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Fee shall
terminate five years from the date of this Agreement. In the event that the
Recipient is not able to receive the full Base Amount, the Payor shall place the
unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to the
Recipient unless and until the Payor receives either a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion
or a Break-Up Fee Ruling, in which event the Payor shall pay to the Recipient
the unpaid Base Amount; provided, however, that, if the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion
or the Break-Up Fee Ruling is based on the absence of constructive receipt, the
amount that will be paid upon the receipt of the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or the
Break-Up Fee Ruling will be the maximum amount that can be paid at that time
without causing the Recipient to fail the REIT Requirements, as determined by
the Recipient's independent accountants based on the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or
Break-Up Fee Ruling, and any remaining amount payable to the Recipient shall be
paid as soon as it shall be possible to do so without causing the Recipient to
fail the REIT Requirements, as determined by the Recipient's independent
accountants based on the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or Break-Up Fee Ruling.

<PAGE>

         (e)      The "Break-Up Expenses" payable to the Recipient shall be an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) $5 million and (ii) the Recipient's
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, all attorneys',
accountants', commercial bankers' and investment bankers' fees and expenses);
provided, however, such expenses shall not exceed the sum of (A) the maximum
amount that can be paid to the Recipient without causing it to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, as determined by
independent accountants to the Recipient, and (B) in the event the Recipient
receives a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or a Break-Up Fee Ruling holding that the
Recipient's receipt of the Break-Up Expenses would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT
Requirements or that receipt by the Recipient of the remaining balance of the
Break-Up Expenses following the receipt of and pursuant to such ruling or
opinion would not be deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Break-Up
Expenses less the amount payable under clause (A) above; provided, however,
that, if the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or Break-Up Fee Ruling is based on the
absence of constructive receipt, the amount that will be paid upon the receipt
of the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or the Break-Up Fee Ruling will be the maximum
amount that can be paid at that time without causing the Recipient to fail the
REIT Requirements, as determined by the Recipient's independent accountants
based on the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or Break-Up Fee Ruling, and any remaining
amount payable to the Recipient pursuant to clause (B) shall be paid as soon as
it shall be possible to do so without causing the Recipient to fail the REIT
Requirements, as determined by the Recipient's independent accountants based on
the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or Break-Up Fee Ruling. The obligation of the Payor
to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Expenses shall terminate five years
from the date of this Agreement. In the event that the Recipient is not able to
receive the full Break-Up Expenses, the Payor shall place the unpaid amount in
escrow and shall not release any portion thereof to the Recipient unless and
until the Payor receives either a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or a Break-Up Fee
Ruling with respect to the Break-Up Expenses, in which event the Payor shall pay
to the Recipient the unpaid Break-Up Expenses; provided, however, if the
Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or the Break-Up Fee Ruling is based on the absence of
constructive receipt, the amount that will be paid upon the receipt of the
Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or the Break-Up Fee Ruling will be the maximum amount
that can be paid at that time without causing the Recipient to fail the REIT
Requirements, as determined by the Recipient's independent accountants based on
the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or Break-Up Fee Ruling, and any remaining amount
payable to the Recipient shall be paid as soon as it shall be possible to do so
without causing the Recipient to fail the REIT Requirements, as determined by
the Recipient's independent accountants based on the Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion or
Break-Up Fee Ruling.

         9.3      EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either MeriStar or FelCor as provided in Section 9.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability
or obligation on the part of FelCor, or MeriStar, other than pursuant to the
last sentence of Section 7.2, Section 9.2, this Section 9.3 and Article 10.

after any Stockholder Approvals are obtained and prior to the filing of the
Articles of Merger with the Department; provided, however, that, after the
Stockholder Approvals are obtained, no such amendment, modification or
supplement shall be made which by law requires the further approval of
stockholders without obtaining such further approval. The parties agree to amend
this Agreement in the manner provided in the immediately preceding sentence to
the extent required to (a) continue the status of FelCor or MeriStar as a REIT

representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or
in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the

part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

a Section or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect

shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party.

         10.5     ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except as
provided in Section 7.4, this Agreement, the MeriStar Disclosure Letter, the
FelCor Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement and the other agreements
entered into in connection with the

                                       71

<PAGE>

Merger or OP Merger constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and are not intended to confer
upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies.

         10.6     GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF
LAWS THEREOF (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF NEW YORK'S GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAWS),
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND OR DELAWARE ARE
MANDATORILY APPLICABLE.

         10.7     ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without
the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

         10.8     ENFORCEMENT. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal court located in the
Southern District of New York or in any state court located in New York, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
(without making such submission exclusive) to the personal jurisdiction of any
federal court located in the Southern District of New York or any state court
located in New York in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court.

         10.9     SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted
to be only so broad as is enforceable.
