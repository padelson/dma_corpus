Share Closing Consideration over (B) the Deemed Per Unit Exercise Price,
_plus_ each Per Share Contingent Payment, if any, subject to Section 2.4.

 

(ii) _Options_. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, there will be

8  Stockholder and Incentive Plan Payee and (B) the Termination Payment

Technology or commercialize the Company Products; provided that Parent shall

(2) The parties acknowledge and agree that Parents or the Surviving

shall have no right to receive any particular Contingent Payment (or portion
thereof) unless and until the applicable Milestone is actually realized.

(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing in
this Section 2.4 shall (i) create any employment right or entitlement of any
Person that is an employee of the Company prior to the Effective Time, or any
Person that is an employee of the Surviving Corporation or Parent after
the Effective Time, (ii) represent an ownership interest in Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or (iii) create any fiduciary duty on the part of Parent
to the Sellers with respect to the Contingent Payments.

 

(4) The right of the Sellers to receive any portion of any Contingent Payment

federal or state securities Laws (and shall confer upon each Seller only the
rights of a general unsecured creditor under applicable state Law), (ii) will
not be represented by any form of

(v) except for Permitted Transfers, may not be sold, assigned, gifted,

Section 2.5 _Spreadsheet; Payment and Surrender of Stock_.

(a) Attached hereto as _Schedule 2.5_ is a spreadsheet (the " _Spreadsheet_ ")
that includes, among other things:

(i) with respect to each Stockholder: (A) such Stockholders name and address;
(B) the class, series and number of shares of Outstanding Capital Stock held
by such Person; (C) the respective certificate number(s) representing such
shares; (D) the respective date(s) of acquisition of such shares; (E) the
portion of the Merger Consideration to be paid to such Stockholder at the
Closing in respect of such shares, including the aggregate dollar amount of
cash Merger Consideration and the aggregate number of Merger Shares to be
issued to such Stockholder in connection with the Closing; (F) any amounts
required to be deducted, withheld, escrowed or otherwise restricted pursuant
to this Agreement or the applicable Stock Vesting Agreement and if applicable,
the dates of release of such restrictions; and (G) such other information as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably request;

(ii) with respect to each Incentive Plan Payee: (A) the name, address and
state of residence of such Person; (B) the number of Units held by such
Person; (C) the aggregate dollar amount of cash Merger Consideration to be
issued to such Person at Closing; (D) any amounts required to be

Agreement or the applicable Restricted Consideration Vesting Agreement and if

information as Parent or the Exchange Agent may reasonably request; and

(iii) the applicable Termination Payments.

 

(b) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent, in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent, an updated Spreadsheet that reflects any changes permitted by this
Agreement. The Spreadsheet shall be certified as true, complete and correct by
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (such certification, the "
_Spreadsheet Certificate_ ").

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Sellers Representative shall
appoint an Exchange Agent to effect the delivery of Merger Consideration. No
later than the Closing Date, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail
to each Stockholder designated on the Spreadsheet as receiving Merger
Consideration, a letter of transmittal (the " _Letters of Transmittal_ ") and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates representing
the Outstanding Capital Stock held by such Stockholder in exchange for such
holders portion of the Merger Consideration. Subject to the surrender of the
applicable Certificate by a Stockholder to the Exchange Agent, together with a
duly executed letter of transmittal (including a completed W-9 or substitute
W-9, or original W-8, if applicable) and, if such Stockholder has made a

 



10  Stock/Cash Election, a duly executed Investor Representation Statement and
Lock-up Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the holder of such
Certificate the applicable cash portion of the Closing Merger Consideration
and Parent shall cause the applicable Merger Shares to be issued, in each case
without interest and less any Tax withholdings, and any such Certificate shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this ARTICLE II,
for any Certificates not surrendered at the Effective Time, from and after the
Effective Time, each such Certificate shall be deemed to represent only the
right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration determined pursuant to this Agreement then due and shall not
evidence any interest in, or any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. If the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the one in whose name a Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that such Certificate be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and accompanied by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes and other applicable taxes have been paid or provided for.

Section 2.6 _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger.
All fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that any Seller would otherwise
be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated and if a
fractional shares results from such aggregation, such Seller shall be entitled
to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash, without interest, determined
by multiplying such fractional share by the Parent Common Stock Price and
rounding such amount to the nearest whole cent.

Section 2.7 _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
ARTICLE II, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
any party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

Section 2.8 _Dissenting Shares; Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Capital Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by Stockholders who have exercised and perfected
appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL (collectively,
the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration as described in
Section 2.1. Such Stockholders shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares, unless and until such
Stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses its
appraisal rights under the DGCL. All Dissenting Shares held by Stockholders
who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or
lost their right to appraisal of such shares of Company Capital Stock under
the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive a
portion of the Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.1, without any
interest thereon and less any applicable Tax withholding, upon the surrender
of the certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock.

 



11 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice within one (1) Business
Day of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations
and Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5 to
pay for any Dissenting Shares shall be returned by the Exchange Agent to
Parent upon demand; provided, that Parent shall remain liable to pay or cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration with respect to any shares of Company Capital Stock covered by
the third sentence of Section 2.8(a).

 

Section 2.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Securities_. From and after the
Effective Time, no Securities of the Company will be deemed to be
outstanding, and holders of Certificates formerly representing such Securities
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except as provided herein
or by applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of Company shall be closed and no further registration or transfer of
Securities shall thereafter be made, excepting for stock issued by the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II.

Section 2.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates or stock option
agreements, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact coupled with an
indemnity by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration as may be required
pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof; provided, however, that the Exchange Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificates or stock option
agreements alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

Section 2.11 _Tax Withholding_.

 

(a) The Company and, on its behalf, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, or any other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under
the Code, or any provision of any Federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law and
to request any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or substitute W-9 or
the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information,
and to share such forms with Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such deducted and withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



12 (b) The parties make no representations or warranties to any Seller regarding
the tax treatment of the Merger, or any of the tax consequences to the
Company or any Seller of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions or payments contemplated hereby.

 

Section 2.12 _Transfer Taxes_. The Sellers will pay all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration, and other similar Taxes and all conveyance
fees, recording charges and other fees and charges arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") as and when
due. Each of Parent and the Sellers will file all necessary Tax Returns or
other documentation required to be filed by such party with respect to
Transfer Taxes, and if required by applicable Law, the other parties will join
in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 

Section 2.13 _Further Assurances_. If at any time after the Effective Time
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion,
or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, instruments,
assurances or any other actions or things are reasonably necessary to
consummate the Merger or vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub

connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out the purpose and intent
of this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments, instruments and assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of each such corporation or otherwise, all
such other actions and things reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger
and to carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement or as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation in each case, to the extent such action is not inconsistent with
this Agreement.

Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company and the Sellers that the
following representations and warranties are true and correct as of the
date hereof. The Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections
corresponding to the sections contained in this Agreement and the disclosure
in any section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall qualify the
corresponding section in this Agreement and each other section in this
Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
disclosure qualifies, or constitutes an exception to, such other action.

 

Section 4.1 _Organization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,

of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the

Sub has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The

the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger, except for the approval
of this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby by Parent as the
sole stockholder of Merger Sub. This Agreement has been duly executed by
Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub

validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of any Liens
created by Parent (including restrictions on rights of disposition) and not
subject to any preemptive rights created by statute, the organizational

included in the Parent SEC Reports (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ")
comply as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

notice, during normal business hours and in a manner that does not materially

41  proceedings shall be kept confidential under the terms of the confidential
disclosure agreement, effective as of February 1, 2015, by and between Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidential Disclosure Agreement_ ") and no such
information shall be used by any such Persons other than as contemplated by
this Agreement. In this regard, the Company and the Principal Stockholders
acknowledge that Parents common stock is publicly traded and that any
information obtained during the course of due diligence and negotiation of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements could be considered to be material

agree that such Persons and their Representatives shall not engage in any
discussions, correspondence or transactions in Parents common stock in
violation of applicable securities Laws.

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation of Competing Transaction_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any Principal Stockholder shall (and neither the
Company nor any Principal Stockholder shall authorize or permit any Affiliate
of the Company or any of its or their respective directors, officers,
employees, representatives and agents, including investment bankers, attorneys

or enter into discussions with, knowingly encourage, contact, respond to,
enable or provide financial or operational or other non-public information to,

of the Securities or material assets of the Company, whether by investment,
merger, tender offer, exchange offer, sale of assets or similar transactions
involving the Company or any division or operating or principal business unit
of the Company (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "). The Company will immediately
communicate to Parent the existence and terms of any proposal, discussion,
negotiation or inquiry which it may receive (and will promptly provide to

otherwise receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a "parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) from the Company, or,
to the Companys Knowledge, from Parent, under Section 280G of the Code as a
result of the Closing or the consummation of the Merger (including in
connection with certain changes in any such Persons employment circumstances
following the consummation of the Merger). By the execution of such waiver
agreement, the Person executing the waiver shall agree to waive all of his
or her right and entitlement to receive (or if already paid, his or her right
and entitlement to keep) any portion of such "parachute payments" which would
cause the Person executing the waiver to receive an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), unless the
Stockholders approve such waived payments in accordance with Section
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code.

 

(b) The Company shall submit the payments which are waived pursuant to the
waiver agreements described in Section 5.8(a) to its Stockholders for their

(a) Effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing
Date, the Company shall terminate any and all Benefit Plans intended to

of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company. The form and substance
of such resolutions shall be subject to review and reasonable approval of
Parent. In the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be
anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees
then such charges or fees shall be included in Merger Expenses of the Company
and shall be the responsibility of the Company, and the Company shall take
such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing.

Agreement; provided, that such indemnification shall be limited to the extent
of remaining available coverage under the "tail" insurance policy contemplated

contrary in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any other
agreement or understanding between the Company and such Persons.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have obtained a prepaid
policy or policies (i.e., a "tail" insurance policy), which shall be
effective as of the Effective Time, with a claims period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, on term acceptable to Parent with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby).
Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall terminate the insurance
policy referred to in the preceding sentence prior to the expiration of the
term of such policy. Any payments with respect to such tail coverage that are
not made by the Company prior to or concurrent with the Closing, shall be
deemed Merger Expenses.

authorization for Parent to deliver such FIRPTA Certificate to the IRS on
behalf of the Company upon the Closing. If the Company has not delivered such
FIRPTA Certificate to Parent at or prior to Closing, Parents sole remedy
shall be to withhold from the Merger Consideration any amounts that it is
required to withhold under applicable Law along with any Damages related
thereto.

Section 5.15 _State Takeover Statutes_. In the event that any "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," or other anti-takeover statute or
regulation or any anti-takeover provision of the Charter Documents is or
becomes, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to the Company, shares
of Company Capital Stock, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the Company, at the direction of its Board of Directors,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may

conditions set forth in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) obtaining all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, and (iv) execution or
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the

or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing such that any condition in ARTICLE
VII would not be satisfied, and (b) the occurrence of any material failure of
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any

Returns for the Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
that are filed after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared,
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, in accordance with
past practice of the Company and shall be subject to the Sellers
Representatives approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) and shall be delivered to the Sellers Representative at least
seventy five (75) days prior to the due

 



47  date in the case of income Tax Returns, and at least thirty (30) days prior
to the due date (or if, as of the Closing Date, less than thirty (30) days
remain before filing is due, one third ( 1⁄3) of the days remaining between
the Closing Date and the filing due date) in the case of any other Tax
Returns, for review and approval. Within ten (10) Business Days following the
delivery of such Tax Return to the Sellers Representative, the Sellers
Representative shall notify Parent of any dispute of any item contained
therein, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
dispute. If the Sellers Representative fails to notify Parent of any dispute
within such ten (10) Business Day period, such Tax Return shall be deemed to
be accepted by the Sellers Representative. If the Sellers Representative
notifies Parent in writing of any objection regarding such Tax Return within
the time periods set forth in this Section 6.3(a), Parent and the Sellers
Representative shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as
promptly as possible. If Parent and the Sellers Representative are unable to
resolve the dispute within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such
objection, the Sellers Representative shall submit such disputed items to
the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution. The Independent Accounting
Firm shall, within forty-five (45) calendar days following its selection,
deliver to Parent and the Sellers Representative a written report setting
forth its determination as to such disputed items (and only such disputed
items), and its determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the parties
thereto for the purposes hereof. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be apportioned equally (50/50) between the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand.

 

(b) _Taxable Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_.
Parent shall prepare and cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns for the Company for all periods beginning before the Closing
Date and ending after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared,
subject to the requirements of applicable Law, in accordance with the past
practice of the Company and shall be subject to the Sellers Representatives
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and
shall be delivered to the Sellers Representative at least seventy five (75)
days prior to the due date in the case of income Tax Returns, and at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date (or if, as of the Closing Date, less
than thirty (30) days remain before filing is due, one third ( 1⁄3) of the
days remaining between the Closing Date and the filing due date) in the case
of other Tax Returns, for review and approval. Within ten (10) Business Days
following the delivery of such Tax Return to the Sellers Representative, the
Sellers Representative shall notify Parent of any dispute of any item
contained therein, which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such dispute. If the Sellers Representative fails to notify Parent
of any dispute within such ten (10) Business Day period, such Tax Return shall
be deemed to be accepted by the Sellers Representative. If the Sellers
Representative notifies Parent in writing of any objection regarding such Tax
Return within the time periods set forth in this Section 6.3(b), Parent and
the Sellers Representative shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such
dispute as promptly as possible. If Parent and the Sellers Representative are
unable to resolve the dispute within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of
such objection, the Sellers Representative shall submit such disputed items
to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution. The Independent Accounting
Firm shall, within forty-five (45) calendar days following its selection,
deliver to Parent and the Sellers Representative a written report setting
forth its determination as to such disputed items (and only such disputed
items), and its determinations will be conclusive and binding upon the parties
thereto for the purposes hereof. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be apportioned equally (50/50) between the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand.

 



48 (c) For purposes of calculating the Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period in the case of a Straddle Period: (i) the real, personal and
intangible property Taxes (and any other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis) of
the Company for such Straddle Period shall equal the amount of such Tax for
the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period; and (ii) all other Taxes of the Company (other than Transfer
Taxes) for such Straddle Period shall equal the amount due for such other
Taxes as if the Company had performed an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date; provided, however,
that transactions that occur on the Closing Date but after the Closing and
that are not incurred in the ordinary course of business of the Company shall
be considered to be attributable to the period that commences on the day
following the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Straddle
Period_ " means any taxable period beginning on or prior to the Closing Date
and ending after the Closing Date. For purposes of calculating the Taxes
attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period in the case of a Straddle Period,
the amount of any item that is taken into account only once for each taxable
period (e.g., the benefit of graduated Tax rates, exemption amounts) shall be
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period in proportion to the number of days
in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing
Date.

(d) _Post-Closing Actions_. Parent shall not (and shall not cause or permit
the Company or any Affiliate to) file, amend, re-file or otherwise modify any
Tax Return or Tax election relating in whole or in part to the Company or
agree to the waiver or any extension of the statute of limitations, in each
case with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(e) _Taxable Periods Beginning and Ending After the Closing Date_. Parent
shall be responsible for, and shall have sole discretion with respect to, all
Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company with respect to any taxable
period that begins after the Closing Date.

 

(f) _Cooperation and Assistance_. Parent and the Sellers Representative shall
provide each other with such cooperation and assistance as may be reasonably
requested by either of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return and the conduct of any Tax Contest for any taxable period for which one
party could reasonably require the assistance of the other party in obtaining
necessary information, and until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, and each will retain and provide the other with any records or
information which may be necessary for such Tax Return or Tax Contest. Parent
and the Sellers Representative further agree, upon request, to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Governmental Entity or any other Person and take any other actions,
in each case, as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 9.1 _Indemnification by the Sellers_. From and after the Effective

hold harmless and reimburse each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and any

them (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") for any demand, claim, payment,
obligation, action or cause of action, assessment, loss, Liability, damage,
cost, interest, award, judgment, penalty or expense (including any and all
third party claims and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, but excluding
any special or punitive damages unless arising in connection with any third
party claim or any willful, intentional or knowing misrepresentation or fraud)
(collectively, " _Damages_ ") incurred or sustained by the Indemnified

directly or indirectly:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties

is liable as a result of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated,
combined, unitary or aggregate group prior to the Closing Date, and all Taxes

").

 



54 For the purpose of determining the amount of Damages suffered by an
Indemnified Party as a result of any breach of any representation or warranty
of the Company or Principal Stockholder (but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
for determining the existence of such breach), any representation or warranty
that is qualified by a materiality or a Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifier or standard shall be deemed breached if it is untrue or incorrect,
without giving effect to such materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect
qualifier or standard.

forth in Section 3.1 (Organization), Section 3.2 (Capitalization), Section

warranties set forth in Section 3.13 (Intellectual Property) (the "
_Intellectual Property Reps_ ") shall survive until the [***] anniversary of

provided, however, that if a Notice of Claim (as defined below) relating to
any representation or warranty set forth in ARTICLE III is given to the
Sellers Representative on or prior to the applicable expiration date of such
representation or warranty, then, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 9.2, such representation or warranty shall
not expire, but rather shall remain in full force and effect until such time
as each and every claim that is based upon, or that relates to, any breach of
such representation or warranty has been fully and finally resolved.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 9.2(a),
the limitations set forth in Section 9.2(a) shall not apply in the case of
claims based upon the breach of any covenant or obligation (including the
indemnifiable matters set forth in Section 9.1(b)-(g)) or in the case of any
willful, intentional or knowing misrepresentation or fraud by the Company or
any Seller in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

(c) The representations and warranties set forth in ARTICLE IV shall survive
until 180 days after the Closing and the Sellers Representative, on behalf
of the Sellers, shall have the exclusive right to bring any and all claims
against Parent and/or Merger Sub for breach of any of their respective
representations, warranties, obligations or covenants under this Agreement.

investigation made by or any knowledge of, any of the Indemnified Parties or
any of their Representatives.

Section 9.3 _[***]_. The provisions for indemnity contained in Section 9.1
shall become effective only in the event that the aggregate amount of all

55  for the amount of such Damages [***]; provided, however, that claims from
and against Damages relating to (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of the
Fundamental Reps and (ii) the indemnifiable matters set forth in Section
9.1(b)-(g), shall not be subject to the [***].

Section 9.4 _Limitations on Indemnity_.

(a) The aggregate Liability of any Indemnifying Party for claims of
indemnification from and against Damages shall not exceed on a pro rata basis
(based on the total Closing Merger Consideration payable to the Indemnifying
Parties, except as provided in Section 9.6(c)(iv) below) (i) with respect to
Damages pursuant to Section 9.1(a) arising from or relating to any inaccuracy
in or breach of representations and warranties other than the Intellectual
Property Reps and the Fundamental Reps, [***] percent ([***]%) of the portion
of the Merger Consideration actually paid or otherwise due and payable to
such Indemnifying Party (without taking into account any prior Offset
Amounts); (ii) with respect to Damages pursuant to Section 9.1(a) arising from
or relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of the Intellectual Property
Reps, [***] percent ([***]%) of the Merger Consideration actually paid or
otherwise due and payable to such Indemnifying Party (without taking into
account any prior Offset Amounts); provided that for purposes of calculating
the aggregate amount of Damages arising from or relating to any inaccuracy in
or breach of the Intellectual Property Reps, all Damages arising from or
relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of all other representations and
warranties shall be included; and (iii) with respect to Damages pursuant to
Section 9.1(a) arising from or relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of the
Fundamental Reps and for any other claims of indemnification made pursuant to
this Article IX, the Merger Consideration actually paid or otherwise due and
payable to such Indemnifying Party (without taking into account any prior
Offset Amounts); provided, further, that the limitations in this clause (a)
shall not apply to or otherwise limit any claims for indemnification from and
against Damages for willful, intentional or knowing misrepresentation or fraud
in which such Indemnifying Party participated or of which such Indemnifying
Party had actual knowledge.

 

(b) [***]. The amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party under
this Article IX with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by the
amount of any insurance payment actually received by such Indemnified Party
(or an Affiliate thereof) with respect to such indemnity claim, net of
expenses (including any increases in applicable premiums, collection costs,
expenses and reserves, deductibles, premium adjustments, retrospectively
rated premiums and other Damages incurred in collecting such recovery)
reasonably incurred in connection with the recovery of such amounts, in each
case only to the extent that such amounts are recovered as a result of and
specifically in reference to the facts and circumstances giving rise to such
Damages (each source identified in clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Collateral
Source_ "). In the event that any Damages become payable to an Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Article IX or otherwise, such Damages shall become
immediately due and payable, regardless of whether amounts payable from a
Collateral Source, if applicable, have been determined. Except as provided in
the first sentence of this Section 9.4(b), no Indemnified Party shall have any
obligation to pursue any Collateral Source with respect to any Damages or
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX and if an Indemnified Party elects
not to pursue such Collateral Source, such Damages shall in no way be reduced
and the right of such Indemnified Party to pursue indemnification for such
Damages hereunder shall not be limited in any respect. If an Indemnified Party
(or an Affiliate) receives any insurance payment in connection with any claim

56  for Damages for which it has already been indemnified by the Indemnifying
Parties, it shall pay or cause to be paid (via the Exchange Agent or
otherwise) to the Indemnifying Parties from whom such amount was set off or
by whom such amount was paid, within thirty (30) days of receiving such
insurance payment, an amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount previously
received by the Indemnified Party under this Article IX with respect to such
claim plus the amount of the insurance payments received, over (ii) the amount
of Damages with respect to such claim which the Indemnifying Parties have
become entitled to receive under this Article IX; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be permitted to effect
payment of any such amount to any Incentive Plan Payee through payroll of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries on the next administratively practicable
payroll date following the time specified in this Section 9.4(b).

(c) No Indemnifying Party shall have any Liability for any fraud on the part
of any other Indemnifying Party acting in his, her or its personal capacity
and not on behalf of the Company in connection with any Ancillary Agreement.

 

(d) Parent shall not seek to recover any Damages personally from any
Indemnifying Party, except to the extent that the then-available
Offset Amount shall be insufficient to fully indemnify the Indemnified
Parties for such Damages and subject to the limitations on liability of
certain Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 9.6(c)(iv).

 

(e) From and after the Closing, the Sellers shall not have any right of
contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to any Damages
claimed by an Indemnified Party.

(f) This ARTICLE IX provides for indemnification against all Damages incurred
or sustained by one or more of the Indemnified Parties as a result of the
matters set forth herein, whether such indemnification is (i) pursuant to a
direct claim by any Indemnified Party or (ii) against Damages incurred or
sustained as a result of a third party claim.

(g) For Tax purposes, any payment made pursuant to this ARTICLE IX shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 

Section 9.5 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Proceeding with respect to which
an Indemnified Party believes it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this ARTICLE IX, such Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its election,
to proceed with the defense of such claim or Proceeding on its own. If such
Indemnified Party so proceeds with the defense of any such claim or
Proceeding:

(a) subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE IX, all reasonable
expenses (including attorneys fees) relating to the defense of such claim or
Proceeding (and all amounts due pursuant to any settlement, adjustment or
compromise with respect to such claim or Proceeding) shall be borne and paid
exclusively by the Indemnifying Parties;

 



57 (b) the Indemnifying Parties shall make available to the Indemnified Party any
documents and materials in their possession or control that may be necessary
to the defense of such claim or Proceeding;

(c) the Sellers Representative will be entitled to participate in the
defense of any such claim or Proceeding on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
(but not to appear of record or communicate with the Person asserting any such
claim or Proceeding or its Representatives), at the sole cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Parties; and

(d) the Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of any claim or
Proceeding with respect to which it believes it is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this ARTICLE IX that imposes any Liability on any Indemnifying
Party without the consent of the Sellers Representative (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

An Indemnified Party shall give the Sellers Representative notice after it
has been served in connection with the commencement of any such claim or
Proceeding against any Indemnified Party; provided, that any failure on the
part of any Indemnified Party to so notify the Sellers Representative shall
not limit any of the obligations of the Sellers, or any of the rights of any
Indemnified Party, under this ARTICLE IX (except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the defense of such Proceeding). If an Indemnified Party
does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such Proceeding, the
Sellers Representative may proceed with the defense of such Proceeding with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party or Indemnified
Parties; provided, that the Sellers Representative may not settle
or compromise any such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties.

Section 9.6  _Claim Procedures_. Any claim for indemnification pursuant to
this ARTICLE IX (and, at the option of any Indemnified Party, any other claim
for a monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon fraud,
relating to this Agreement) shall be brought and resolved exclusively in
accordance with this Section 9.6.

(a) _Notice of Claims for Indemnification_. If any Indemnified Party has
incurred or suffered or claims to have incurred or suffered, or believes that
it may incur or suffer, Damages for which it is or may be entitled to be held
harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed under this ARTICLE IX or for
which it is or may be entitled to a monetary remedy (such as in the case of a
claim based on fraud), such Indemnified Party shall deliver a notice of claim
(a " _Notice of Claim_ ") to the Sellers Representative. Each Notice of
Claim shall: (i) state that such Indemnified Party believes that such
Indemnified Party is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under ARTICLE IX of the Agreement or is or may otherwise be
entitled to a monetary remedy; (ii) contain a brief description of the
circumstances supporting such Indemnified Partys belief that such Indemnified
Party is so entitled to indemnification or is or may otherwise be entitled to
a monetary remedy; and (iii) if practicable, contain a non-binding,
preliminary estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of actual and potential
Damages that have arisen and may arise as a result of such circumstances (the
aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be modified by such Indemnified
Party from time to time, being referred to as the " _Claimed Amount_ ").

 



58 (b) _Objecting to Claims for Indemnification_. During the thirty (30) day
period commencing upon delivery by an Indemnified Party to the Sellers
Representative of a Notice of Claim (the " _Dispute Period_ "), the Sellers
Representative may deliver to the Indemnified Party who delivered the Notice
of Claim a written response (the " _Response Notice_ ") in which the Sellers
Representative: (i) agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the
Indemnified Party; (ii) agrees that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount
(the " _Agreed Amount_ ") is owed to the Indemnified Party; or (iii) indicates
that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnified Party. If the
Response Notice is delivered in accordance with clause (ii) or (iii) of the
preceding sentence, the Response Notice shall also contain a brief description
of the facts and circumstances supporting the Sellers Representatives claim
that only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is
not agreed to be owed to the Indemnified Party pursuant to the Response Notice
(or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Sellers Representative asserts in
the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the
Indemnified Party) is referred to herein as the " _Contested Amount_ " (it
being understood that the Contested Amount shall be modified from time to time
to reflect any good faith modifications by the Indemnified Party to the
Claimed Amount). If a Response Notice is not received by the Indemnified Party
prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then the Sellers
Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that the full
Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnified Party.

(c) _Set-Off and Payment of Uncontested Amounts_. All payments by the Sellers
described in this Section 9.6(c) shall be subject to the limitations on
indemnity set forth in Section 9.4.

 

(i) Parent shall have the right to set off and apply against any and all
Contingent Payments an amount up to all Claimed Amounts specified in any
Notice of Claim delivered by Parent hereunder prior to the date of the
Contingent Payment against which such set off is applied that have not
otherwise been deducted from any prior Contingent Payment or paid by the
Indemnifying Parties to Parent and continue to be owed to or recoverable by
any Indemnified Party (the amount so withheld and set-off pursuant to this
Section 9.6(c), the " _Offset Amount_ "); provided, however, that, except as
set forth below and except in the case of fraud, intentional or knowing
breach, the aggregate amount of Damages for which Parent may exercise such set
off rights shall not exceed [***] percent ([***]%) of the Closing Merger
Consideration plus the aggregate amount of any Contingent Payments previously
realized (without taking into account any prior Offset Amounts) plus the
applicable Contingent Payment, except (x) in the case of claims based on
breaches of the Intellectual Property Reps, in which case the aggregate
amount of Damages for which Parent may exercise such set off rights in
respect of such claims shall not exceed [***] percent ([***]%) of the Closing
Merger Consideration plus the aggregate amount of any Contingent Payments
previously realized (without taking into account any prior Offset Amounts)
plus the applicable Contingent Payment (provided that in calculating the
aggregate amount of the Damages for which Parent may exercise such set off
rights for breaches of the Intellectual Property Reps, such calculation shall
include all other Damages for which Parent may exercise such set off rights),
and (y) in the case of claims based on breaches of the Fundamental Reps or
claims pursuant to Section 9.1(b)-(g), in which case the aggregate amount of
Damages for which Parent may exercise such set off rights in respect of such
claims shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the Closing Merger
Consideration plus the aggregate amount of any Contingent Payments previously
realized (without taking into account any prior Offset Amounts) plus the
applicable Contingent Payment.

59 (ii) In the event Parent exercises its set off rights pursuant to Section
9.6(c) and withholds an Offset Amount from any Contingent Payment, Parent
shall notify the Sellers Representative thereof in writing (the " _Offset
Notification_ ") no later than two (2) Business Days after such Contingent
Payment is due, which Offset Notification shall describe in particular the
claim for indemnification with respect to which such set off rights have been
exercised.

 

(iii) In the event Parent exercises its set off rights pursuant to Section
9.6(c) and withholds an Offset Amount from any Contingent Payment with
respect to any Claimed Amount specified in the applicable Notice of Claim,
upon the final resolution, in accordance with the provisions of this Article
IX, of the claim for indemnification with respect to which the Notice of Claim
is delivered, Parent shall cause the Indemnifying Parties from whom such
amount was set off to be paid the amount, if any, by which the Offset Amount
exceeds the amount of Damages to which Parent has been deemed or determined to
be entitled in connection with such resolution and for which such Persons are
liable pursuant to this Article IX.

(iv) In the event that, upon the final resolution, in accordance with the
provisions of this Article IX, of any claim for indemnification for which a
Notice of Claim is delivered, no Contingent Payment is then due and payable or
the Damages to which the Indemnifying Parties are entitled in connection with
such claim exceed the aggregate amount of any Contingent Payment then due and
payable, the Indemnifying Parties shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt
of a written payment request from Parent, pay the amount of such shortfall to
Parent in immediately available funds; provided, however, that, the
Stockholders who are not Principal Stockholders and the Incentive Plan Payees
(unless such Incentive Plan Payee is listed on Schedule 9.6(c)(iv) hereto),
shall not be liable for any payment to Parent under this Section 9.6(c)(iv)
and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the remaining
Indemnifying Parties shall be liable on a pro rata basis for all payments due
pursuant to this Section 9.6(c)(iv), including the amounts for which the
designated Stockholders and Incentive Plan Payees are not liable pursuant to
the preceding proviso.

 

(d) _Resolution of Contested Amounts_.

 

(i) If the Sellers Representative delivers a Response Notice to the
Indemnified Party during the Dispute Period indicating that there is a
Contested Amount, the Sellers Representative and the Indemnified Party shall
attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount.
If the Indemnified Party and the Sellers Representative resolve such
dispute, then their resolution of such dispute shall be binding on
Indemnifying Parties and such Indemnified Party and a settlement agreement
stipulating the amount owed to the Indemnified Party (the " _Stipulated
Amount_ ") shall be signed by the Indemnified Party and the Sellers
Representative.

(ii) If the Sellers Representative and the Indemnified Party are unable to
resolve the dispute relating to any Contested Amount during the thirty
(30)-day period commencing upon the delivery of the Response Notice to the
Indemnified Party, then either the

 



60  Indemnified Party or the Sellers Representative may submit the claim
described in the Notice of Claim to arbitration to be settled by binding
arbitration in New York, New York in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive
Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect. Arbitration will be conducted
by one arbitrator, mutually selected by the Indemnified Party and the Sellers
Representative; provided, however, that if Indemnified Party and the Sellers
Representative fail to mutually select an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days
after such dispute is submitted to arbitration, then the arbitrator shall be
selected by JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures then in effect. The parties agree to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the arbitration hearing to be conducted within seventy-five
(75) days after the appointment of the arbitrator, and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the decision of the arbitrator to be furnished
within fifteen (15) days after the conclusion of the arbitration hearing. The
arbitrators authority shall be confined to deciding: (a) whether the
Indemnified Party is entitled to recover the Contested Amount (or a portion
thereof), and the portion of the Contested Amount the Indemnified Party is
entitled to recover; and (b) the non-prevailing party in the arbitration. The
final decision of the arbitrator shall include the dollar amount of the award
to the Indemnified Party, if any (the " _Award Amount_ "), shall be furnished
to the Sellers Representative and the Indemnified Party in writing and
shall constitute a conclusive determination of the issue(s) in question,
binding upon the Sellers and the Indemnified Party. The non-prevailing party
in any such arbitration shall pay the reasonable expenses (including
attorneys fees) of the prevailing party, and the fees and expenses
associated with the arbitration (including the arbitrators fees and
expenses). If an Indemnified Party is found to be the prevailing party in any
arbitration, the amount of the fees and expenses of such Indemnified Party
payable by the non-prevailing party pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence shall be added to the Award Amount. The non-prevailing party shall be
determined solely by the arbitrator.

 

(e) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to claims for fraud or intentional
or knowing breach against the Person guilty of such fraud or intentional or
knowing breach, the parties agree that, after the Closing, this ARTICLE IX
shall constitute the sole remedy of any Indemnified Party for recovery of
Damages incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties arising from,
relating or in connection with this Agreement. The foregoing shall not limit
or in any way restrict the representations, warranties and covenants of the
Sellers under the Ancillary Agreements. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit
the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Party for equitable remedies for
non-monetary damages, including specific performance, injunctive and other
equitable relief.

 

Section 9.7 _Sellers  Representative_.

 

(a) The Sellers will authorize, designate and appoint, as part of their

in connection with his, her or its service as the Sellers Representative,
except to the extent that such action or inaction shall have been held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to constitute willful misconduct. The Sellers
shall severally indemnify and hold the Sellers Representative harmless
against any loss, Liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Sellers Representative and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder,
including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by
the Sellers Representative.

(c) The Sellers Representative shall have reasonable access to information
about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of Surviving
Corporations executive officers for purposes of performing his, her or its

nonpublic information from or about Surviving Corporation or the Parent to
anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree in writing to
treat such information confidentially); provided, further, that such access
and assistance shall not interfere with or adversely affect the Surviving
Corporations business.

 

(d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative
shall constitute a decision of all Sellers and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Seller.

her or its responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the
Sellers (acting by a written instrument signed by holders of Company Capital
Stock who held, as of immediately prior to the Closing, a majority (by voting
power) of the then outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock) shall select
another representative to fill the vacancy of the Sellers Representative, and
such substituted representative shall be deemed to be the Sellers
Representative for all purposes of this Agreement. The Sellers
Representative may only be removed upon delivery of written notice to Parent
signed by Persons who, as of immediately prior to the Closing, held a majority
(by voting power) of the then outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock.
The Sellers Representative shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any
replacement of the Sellers Representative, including the identity and address
of the new Sellers Representative.
