(vii) from each Seller, a certification of non-foreign status under Treasury

Purchaser; and

(viii) such other instruments and certificates as may be reasonably requested
by the Purchaser.

transfer in immediately available funds;

Purchaser certifying as to the matters set forth in _Section 9.01(a)_;

(iii) to the Sellers Representative, a copy of the Escrow Agreement duly

Payment of the Adjusted Purchase Price among the Sellers shall be as set forth
in a schedule prepared by the Sellers Representative and furnished to the
Purchaser at least two business days prior to the Closing Date.

2.05 _Adjustment Amount_. No later than five (5) business days prior to the
Closing, the Sellers Representative shall deliver to the Purchaser, a
statement (such statement, the " _Estimated Statement_ "), together with
supporting documentation therefor, setting forth (i) an

 



11  estimate, prepared in good faith and consistent with GAAP and the example
based on the Financial Statements and set forth on _Exhibit A_ , of the
Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Preliminary Working Capital Amount_
"), (ii) a good faith estimate of the Purchase Price Deductions (the "
_Estimated Purchase Price Deductions_ ") and (iii) a good faith estimate of
the Inventory Amount (the " _Estimated Inventory Amount_ ").

For purposes of the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be increased
or decreased, as the case may be, by the Preliminary Working Capital Amount,
reduced by the Estimated Purchase Price Deductions and increased by the
Estimated Inventory Amount and shall be subject to further adjustment after
the Closing as specified in this _Section 2.05_:

(a) No earlier than the first business day immediately following the day on
which the Estimated Statement is delivered to Purchaser and no later than the
day that is one business day prior to the Closing, Sellers Representative,
Purchaser and Purchasers representatives shall conduct a mutual inspection
and physical count of the Inventory.

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative within
60 days after the Closing Date a balance sheet as of the Closing Date
together with a calculation setting forth the (i) Closing Date Net Working
Capital, calculated in accordance with GAAP and the example based on the
Financial Statements and set forth on _Exhibit A_ , (ii) the Purchase Price
Deductions and (iii) the Inventory Amount (collectively, the " _Closing
Balance Sheet_ "). Following delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet, Purchaser
and its representatives shall make available to the Sellers Representative
and its advisors all work papers, accounting books and records and other
pertinent information used in connection with the preparation thereof and
shall reasonably consult with such persons from time to time.

 

(c) Within 30 days after the Closing Balance Sheet is delivered to the
Sellers Representative pursuant to subsection (b) above, the Sellers
Representative shall complete its examination thereof and shall deliver to
Purchaser either (i) a written acknowledgement accepting the Closing Balance
Sheet or (ii) a written report setting forth in reasonable detail
the specific items and matters in dispute (" _Adjustment Report_ "). A
failure by the Sellers Representative to deliver the Adjustment Report within
the required 30-day period shall constitute the Sellers and the
Sellers Representatives acceptance of the Closing Balance Sheet.

(d) During a period of 30 days following the receipt by Purchaser of the
Adjustment Report, the Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall attempt to
resolve any difference they may have with respect to the matters raised in the
Adjustment Report. In the event the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative
fail to agree on the Closing Balance Sheet within such 30 day period, then the
Sellers Representative and Purchaser mutually agree that the Houston, Texas
office of the firm of BDO LLP (or if such firm is unwilling or unable
to serve, another nationally recognizable accounting firm mutually agreed
upon by the Sellers Representative and Purchaser) (the " _Independent
Auditors_ ") shall make the final determination with respect to the specific
disputed matters identified in the Adjustment Report; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Independent Auditors determination as to any disputed matter shall
not be more beneficial to the Purchaser than the determination of that item or
amount by the Purchaser in the Closing Balance Sheet or more beneficial to
Sellers than the determination of that item or amount in the Adjustment
Report. The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Independent 

 



12  Auditors to render their decision as soon as practicable (within 60 days
after the submission to the Independent Auditors of the proposed adjustments
to the Closing Balance Sheet), including by promptly complying with all
reasonable requests by the Independent Auditors for information, books,
records and similar items. The Independent Auditors shall make a determination
as to each of the items in dispute (and each item affected thereby), which
determination shall be in writing and furnished to the Sellers Representative
and Purchaser as promptly as practicable after the items in dispute have been
referred to the Independent Auditors (within 60 days thereafter). The
Independent Auditors shall follow the procedures specified in writing by the
Independent Auditors, unless otherwise agreed in writing between Purchaser and
the Sellers Representative. The decision of the Independent Auditors shall be
final and binding on the Sellers and Purchaser, and may be used in a court of
law by either Sellers or Purchaser for the purpose of enforcing such decision.

(e) After the earlier of (i) the acceptance of the Closing Balance Sheet or
(ii) the failure of the Sellers Representative to deliver an Adjustment
Report within the 30-day period referenced in subsection (c) above or (iii)
if the Sellers Representative delivers such an Adjustment Report, upon the
resolution of the matters raised in such Adjustment Report, the Closing Date
Net Working Capital, Purchase Price Deductions and Inventory Amount shall be
recomputed based upon such Closing Balance Sheet or such resolution, as
applicable. The Sellers shall promptly pay to Purchaser any decrease in the
Purchase Price resulting from such recomputation (a " _Shortfall Reduction_
") by directing that such amount be paid from the Escrow Funds established
pursuant to _Section 2.06_ below. The Purchaser shall promptly pay to the
Sellers any increase in the Purchase Price resulting from such recomputation.

(f) The costs and expenses of the Independent Auditors pursuant to this
_Section 2.05_ shall be borne by the Sellers and Purchaser pro rata in an
amount inversely proportional to the dollar value of the disputed items
determined in each partys favor. By way of example, if Purchaser had taken
the position that the Closing Date Net Working Capital was $100, the Sellers
had taken the position that the Closing Date Net Working Capital was $200, and
the Independent Auditors determine the Closing Date Net Working Capital to be
$130, then Purchaser would pay 30% of the Independent Auditors fees and
expenses and the Sellers would pay 70%.

2.06 _Escrow_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser
shall enter into an Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent substantially in a
form and substance typical for a transaction of this nature and reasonably
acceptable to the parties (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). In accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Purchaser shall deposit with the Escrow
Agent (i) $2,000,000 (such amount, the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") to be
held in a single escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ ") to be
managed and paid out by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement and solely to secure any Shortfall Reduction pursuant to
Section _2.05(e)_ and (ii) the Indemnification Escrow Amount to be held in a
single escrow account (the " _Indemnification Escrow Account_ ") to be
managed and paid out by the Escrow Agent over an 18-month period after the
Closing in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Shortfall Reduction is greater than the funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account, then the Escrow Agent shall pay, by wire

 



13  transfer of immediately available funds from the funds in the
Indemnification Escrow Account, the amount by which the Shortfall Reduction
exceeds the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Immediately after the final determination and payment of a
Shortfall Reduction, any remaining funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account
shall be released by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement
to an account or accounts specified in writing by the Sellers Representative.

 

2.07 _Sellers  Representative_.

(a) Each of the Sellers hereby appoints Charles Lee Culbertson, as its agent
and attorney-in-fact, as its representative for and on behalf of the Sellers
(the " _Sellers  Representative_"), to give and receive notices and
communications hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement, to administer any
claim against the Escrow Funds, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to such
claims, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of
this Agreement; provided, however, that the Sellers Representative shall not
have any authority to enter into amendments of this Agreement or, except in
the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by a particular Seller,
take any action which adversely affects a Seller disproportionately to any
other Seller. No bond shall be required of the Sellers Representative, and
the Sellers Representative shall not receive compensation for its services.
Notices or communications to or from the Sellers Representative shall
constitute notice to or from the Sellers.

 

(b) The Sellers Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as the Sellers Representative while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Sellers shall indemnify the
Sellers Representative and hold the Sellers Representative harmless against
any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on
the part of the Sellers Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Sellers Representatives duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Sellers Representative.

(c) Subject to subsection (a) above, a decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Sellers Representative pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a
decision of the Sellers and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the
Sellers, and Purchaser Indemnified Parties may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers. The Purchaser
Indemnified Parties are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for
any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Sellers Representative.

2.08 _Withholding_. The Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Sellers
or any other Person such amounts as the Purchaser is required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any Tax Law, with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such

 



14  withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made. The Purchaser shall timely pay all withheld amounts to
the proper Tax Authorities and shall properly identify the Person to whose
account such withheld amounts are to be credited.

the holders of Units at any time so long as the Closing Date Net Working
Capital is not reduced below $-0- by virtue of such distribution.

7.02 _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the Closing, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall: (i) afford the officers, employees,

thereto, is made and shall, in any such notice to the Purchaser, indicate in
reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact (unless such proposal or offer was unsolicited and

party which made such proposal or offer). The Sellers and the Company will

from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which any of the Sellers or the Company is a party.

cause any contract or arrangement that is disclosed (or should have been

manage, operate, join, control, lend money or render financial or other
assistance to or participate in or be connected with, as an officer, employee,
partner, stockholder, consultant or otherwise, any Person that competes with
the Purchaser or the Company in the Business in the United States; _provided_
, _however_ , that, for the purposes of this _Section 7.06_, ownership of
securities having no more than one percent of the outstanding voting power of
any competitor which is listed on any national securities exchange shall not
be deemed to be in violation of this _Section 7.06_ as long as the Person
owning such securities has no other connection or relationship with
such competitor. This covenant shall expire on the fifth anniversary of the
Closing for all Restricted Sellers.

(b) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date, no
Restricted Seller shall solicit for employment or hire any member of
management of the Company or induce any member of management of the Company to
leave his or her employment with the Company.

(c) Each of the Restricted Sellers acknowledges that the covenants of the
Restricted Sellers set forth in this  _Section 7.06_ are an essential
element of this Agreement and that, but for the agreement of the Sellers to
comply with these covenants, the Purchaser would not have entered into this
Agreement. Each of the Restricted Sellers acknowledges that this _Section
7.06_ constitutes an independent covenant and shall not be affected by the
performance or nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements by the Purchaser. Each of the Restricted Sellers has
independently consulted with its counsel and after such consultation agrees
that the covenants set forth in this _Section 7.06_ are reasonable and
proper. Each of the Restricted Sellers acknowledges that the Purchaser shall
be irrevocably damaged if the covenants in this _Section 7.06_ are not
specifically enforced. Accordingly, each

 



37  Restricted Seller agrees that, in addition to any other relief to which the
Purchaser may be entitled, the Purchaser would be entitled to seek injunctive
relief from a court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of restraining
the applicable Restricted Seller from any actual or threatened breach of the
covenant set forth in this _Section 7.06_. If the final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
_Section 7.06_ is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court
making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the
power to reduce the scope, duration, area of the term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which any such judgment may be appealed.

7.07 _Continuing Indemnification of Company Officers and Directors_. For six
years after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to,
honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company under any and
all indemnification agreements set forth on _Section 7.07_ of the Disclosure
Schedule in effect immediately prior to the Closing between the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and its officers and directors. In addition, for a period
of six years following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
Companys Organizational Documents to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the
indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the Organizational
Documents of the Company immediately prior to the Closing, and during such
six year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any respect, except as required by applicable laws.

 

7.08 _Purchaser Financing_. For so long as the Purchaser is required under
Regulation S-X of the Securities Act of 1933 to separately include the
financial statements of the Company in any registered offering of securities
by Purchaser, the Company and Sellers shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts (a) to cause the Companys independent auditors to deliver
customary "comfort letters" in connection with any issuance of debt or equity
securities by Purchaser (which comfort letters shall cover such periods as are
addressed by the applicable financial statements and are required under
Regulation S-X to be included in a registration statement for such financing
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission), (b) to consent to be
named as an expert in the offering document related to such financing and (c)
if requested by Purchaser, to provide such information to the underwriters,
initial purchasers, lenders or other parties in any such proposed financing as
may be reasonably requested in connection with such parties due
diligence investigation of the Business. Purchaser shall promptly, upon
request by the Company and Sellers from time to time, reimburse the Company
and Sellers for the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company in connection with such cooperation.

the 18-month anniversary of the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
insofar as any claim is made by the Purchaser for the

 



42  breach of any Fundamental Representation, such representations and
warranties shall, for purposes of such claims by the Purchaser, survive the
Closing for the period of the relevant statute of limitations in respect
thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that covenants contemplating or involving
actions to be taken, or obligations in effect, after the Closing shall survive
the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect after the Closing
until fully performed in accordance with their terms. Neither the period of
survival nor the liability of the Sellers with respect to the representations
and warranties of the Company and Sellers shall be reduced by any
investigation made at any time by or on behalf of the Purchaser. If written
notice of a claim has been given prior to the expiration of the applicable
representations and warranties by the Purchaser to the Sellers
Representative, then the relevant representations and warranties shall
survive as to such claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.

(b) The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the
12-month anniversary of the Closing Date. Neither the period of survival nor
the liability of the Purchaser with respect to the Purchasers
representations and warranties shall be reduced by any investigation made at
any time by or on behalf of the Sellers. If written notice of a claim has been
given prior to the expiration of the applicable representations and
warranties by the Sellers Representative to the Purchaser, then the relevant
representations and warranties shall survive as to such claim, until such
claim has been finally resolved.

 

11.02 _Indemnification by the Sellers_.

(a) The Purchaser and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents,
successors and assigns (each a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ ") shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Sellers for and against any and all
Liabilities, losses, diminution in value, damages, claims, costs and expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties (including, without limitation,
attorneys and consultants fees and expenses) actually suffered or incurred
by them (including, without limitation, any Action brought or otherwise
initiated by any of them) (hereinafter a "Loss"), arising out of or resulting
from:

 

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or the
Sellers contained in this Agreement, which breach occurs during the period of
effectiveness of such representation or warranty (as provided in _Section
11.01(a)_ above); _provided_ , _however_ , that for the purposes of
determining whether a breach has occurred or calculating and determining the
amount of the Loss with respect to any such breach, all references to
materiality, Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifiers shall be
disregarded; or

 

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company or Sellers
contained in this Agreement, which breach occurs during the period of
effectiveness of such covenant or agreement (as provided in _Section
11.01(a)_ above).

(b) A Purchaser Indemnified Party shall give the Sellers Representative
notice of any matter which a Purchaser Indemnified Party has determined has
given rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement prior to the
expiration of the period of effectiveness of the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement (as provided in _Section 11.01(a) _

 



43  above (even if recovery is barred under _Section 11.04(a)_ hereof)),
stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof,
and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of
which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. The obligations and
Liabilities of the Sellers under this _Article XI_ with respect to Losses
arising from claims of any third party which are subject to the
indemnification provided for in this _Article XI_ (" _Third Party Claims_ ")
shall be governed by and be contingent upon the following additional terms and
conditions: if a Purchaser Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any
Third Party Claim, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall give the Sellers
Representative notice of such Third Party Claim within 20 days of the receipt
by the Purchaser Indemnified Party of such notice; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Sellers from any
of their obligations under this _Article XI_ except to the extent that the
Sellers are materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the
Sellers from any other obligation or Liability that it may have to any
Purchaser Indemnified Party otherwise than under this _Article XI_. If the
Sellers dispute in writing their obligation to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that may result from
the Third Party Claim, the parties shall promptly proceed to resolve such
dispute in accordance with _Section 13.08_ hereof. If the Sellers acknowledge
in writing their obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Party
hereunder against any Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, then
the Sellers shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third
Party Claim at their expense and through counsel of their choice if the
Sellers Representative gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Purchaser Indemnified Party within 30 days of the receipt of such notice from
the Purchaser Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if there
exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make
it inappropriate in the judgment of the Purchaser Indemnified Party in its
sole and absolute discretion for the same counsel to represent both the
Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Sellers, then the Purchaser Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel in each jurisdiction for
which the Purchaser Indemnified Party determines counsel is required, at the
expense of the Sellers. In the event that the Sellers exercise the right to
undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided
above, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Sellers in
such defense and make available to the Sellers Representative, at the
Sellers expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information
in the Purchaser Indemnified Partys possession or under the Purchaser
Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Sellers. Similarly, in the event the Purchaser Indemnified Party is, directly
or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the
Sellers shall cooperate with the Purchaser Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Purchaser Indemnified Party, at the Sellers
expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Sellers possession or under the Sellers control relating thereto as
is reasonably required by the Purchaser Indemnified Party. No such Third
Party Claim may be settled by either the Sellers or the Purchaser Indemnified
Party without the prior written consent of the other party.

 

11.03 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_.

(a) The Sellers and their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents,
successors and assigns (each a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Purchaser for and against any and all
Losses, arising out of or resulting from:

 



44 (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement, which breach occurs during the period
of effectiveness of such representation or warranty (as provided in _Section
11.01(b)_ above) provided, however, that for the purposes of determining
whether a breach has occurred or calculating and determining the amount of
the Loss with respect to any such breach, all references to materiality,
material adverse effect or similar qualifiers shall be disregarded; or

 

(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by the Purchaser contained in
this Agreement, which breach occurs during the period of effectiveness of
such covenant or agreement (as provided in _Section 11.01(b)_ above).

(b) A Seller Indemnified Party shall give the Purchaser notice of any matter
which such the Seller Indemnified Party has determined has given rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement prior to the expiration of the
period of effectiveness of the applicable representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement (or provided in _Section 11.01(a)_ above (even if recovery is
barred under _Section 11.04(a)_ hereof)), stating the amount of the Loss, if
known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises. The obligations and Liabilities of the Purchaser under
this _Article XI_ with respect to Losses arising from Third Party Claims
shall be governed by and be contingent upon the following additional terms and
conditions: if a Seller Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third
Party Claim, such Seller Indemnified Party shall give the Purchaser notice of
such Third Party Claim within 20 days of the receipt by the Seller Indemnified
Party of such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide
such notice shall not release the Purchaser from any of its obligations under
this _Article XI_ except to the extent that the Purchaser is materially
prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the Purchaser from any other
obligation or Liability that it may have to any Seller Indemnified Party
otherwise than under this _Article XI_. If the Purchaser disputes in writing
its obligation to indemnify a Seller Indemnified Party hereunder against any
Losses that may result from the Third Party Claim, the parties shall promptly
proceed to resolve such dispute in accordance with _Section 13.08_ hereof. If
the Purchaser acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify a Seller
Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that may result from such
Third Party Claim, then the Purchaser shall be entitled to assume and control
the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of
its choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to such Seller
Indemnified Party within 30 days of the receipt of such notice from the
Seller Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate in the judgment of such Seller Indemnified Party in its sole
and absolute discretion, for the same counsel to represent both the Seller
Indemnified Party and the Purchaser, then the Seller Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to retain its own counsel, in each jurisdiction for which the
Seller Indemnified Party determines counsel is required, at the expense of the
Purchaser. In the event that the Purchaser exercises the right to undertake
any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above,
the Seller Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Purchaser in such
defense and make available to the Purchaser, at the Purchasers expense, all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Seller
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Seller Indemnified Partys
control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Purchaser.
Similarly, in the event the Seller Indemnified Party is, directly or
indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third

 



45  Party Claim, the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Seller Indemnified Party
in such defense and make available to the Seller Indemnified Party, at the
Purchasers expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information
in the Purchasers possession or under the Purchasers control relating
thereto as is reasonably required by the Seller Indemnified Party. No such
Third Party Claim may be settled by either the Purchaser or the Seller
Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the other party.

11.04 _Limits on Indemnification_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, an
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 11.02(a)(i)_ or _Section 11.03(a)(i)_ except for claims
in connection with breaches of any Fundamental Representation, unless and
until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered
from the Indemnifying Party equals or exceeds $3,300,000 (the " _Deductible_
"), after which point the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for those
indemnifiable Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party in excess of the
Deductible.

(b) Except for any claim for indemnification related to a
Fundamental Representation or pursuant to _Section 11.02(a)(ii)_ or _Section
11.03(a)(ii)_ or based on fraud, neither the Sellers, on the one hand, nor the
Purchaser, on the other hand, shall be liable for cumulative aggregate claims
for indemnification pursuant to _Article XI_ in excess of amounts set forth
in the Escrow Funds.

(c) In the case of any claims for indemnification related to _Sections 3.15_
and _3.23_ , the aggregate cumulative liability of the Sellers with respect
thereto shall not exceed 20% of the Purchase Price and in the case of any
claims for indemnification related to _Sections 3.01_ , _3.02_ , _3.04_ ,
_3.27_ , _3.29_ , _4.01_ and _4.02_ or pursuant to _Section 11.02(a)(ii)_ or
_Section 11.03(a)(ii)_, the aggregate cumulative liability of the Sellers
with respect thereto shall not exceed 100% of the Purchase Price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate liability of any Seller to
indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any indemnifiable
Losses arising under _Article XI_ in excess of amounts satisfied from the
Escrow Funds shall in all cases be limited to the Purchase Price received by
such Seller (including amounts received pursuant to distributions from the
Escrow Funds).

 

(d) Except in the case of adjudicated fraud by the Company or one of the
Sellers, the remedy set forth in this _Article XI_  (together with the Escrow
Agreement) represents the sole source of recovery of any claims made by a
Purchaser Indemnified Party after the Closing with respect to claims under
this Agreement.

 

11.05 _Distributions from Escrow Funds_. Indemnified Losses owed to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be satisfied to the extent of available
Escrow Funds. The Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties from the Escrow Funds any amount determined to be owed to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties under this _Article XI_ and/or in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement in the event that:

 



46 (a) the Sellers Representative shall not have objected to the amount claimed
by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for indemnification with respect to any
Loss in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement (or
otherwise); or

(b) the Sellers Representative shall have delivered notice of the Sellers
disagreement as to the amount of any indemnification requested by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and either (i) the Sellers Representative and
the Purchaser shall have, subsequent to the giving of such notice, mutually
agreed that the Sellers are obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for a specified amount and shall have so jointly notified the Escrow
Agent or (ii) a final judgment from which no appeal is taken shall have been
rendered by an arbitral tribunal or Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over the matters relating to such claim by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
for indemnification from the Sellers.

ARTICLE XII

 

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

12.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(i) by mutual consent of the Sellers Representative and Purchaser;

(ii) by Purchaser if there has been a material misrepresentation or breach of
warranty in the representations and warranties of either the Company or the
Sellers set forth herein or if there has been any material failure on the
part of the Company or the Sellers to comply with their respective obligations
hereunder, and such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured to
Purchasers reasonable satisfaction within ten business days after Purchaser
gives the Company or the Sellers, as applicable, written notice identifying
such breach, failure or misrepresentation;

(iii) by Sellers Representative if there has been a material
misrepresentation or breach of warranty in the representations and warranties
of Purchaser set forth herein or if there has been any material failure on
the part of Purchaser to comply with its obligations hereunder, and such
breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured to Sellers reasonable
satisfaction within ten business days after Sellers give Purchaser
written notice identifying such breach, failure or misrepresentation;

(iv) by either the Sellers Representative or the Purchaser if the Closing
shall not have occurred by July 31, 2012; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this clause (iv) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this clause (iv) shall not
be available to any party if all conditions to Closing set forth in _Article
IX_ and _Article X_ have been satisfied other than the approval of the filing
made pursuant to the HSR Act by such date.

 

(v) by either the Purchaser or the Sellers Representative in the event that
any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable. 

 



47 12.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
as provided in _Section 12.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and there shall be no liability on the part of any party hereto except as set
forth in _Section 13.01_; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement.

12.03 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except (a)
by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Sellers and the
Purchaser or (b) by a waiver in accordance with _Section 12.04_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no consent shall be required for the Purchaser to assign its
rights hereunder to its Affiliates so long as the Purchaser remains
principally liable for its obligations hereunder.

12.04 _Waiver_. Either the Purchaser or, in the case of the Sellers, the
Sellers Representative, may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or
in any document delivered by the other party pursuant hereto or (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements of the other party or conditions to
such partys obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to
be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed
as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term
or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement.
The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

ARTICLE XIII
