PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  



  

This PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and dated as of
December 20, 2019 (the " _Effective Date_ "), by and among (i) FTE Networks
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), (ii) US Home Rentals LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (the " _Acquisition Sub_ ") (iii) Alexander Szkaradek, an individual
(" _Alex_ "), (iv) Antoni Szkaradek, an individual (" _Antoni_ "), (v) VPM
Holdings, LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company (" _VPM Holdings_
"), (vi) Kaja 3, LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company (" _Kaja3_
"), (vii) Kaja 2, LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company (" _Kaja2_
"), (viii) Kaja, LLC, a South Carolina limited liability company (" _Kaja_ "),
(ix) Dobry Holdings Master LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Dobry_ " and together with Alex, Antoni, VPM Holdings, Kaja3, Kaja2, and
Kaja, the " _Equity Sellers_ "), (x) Vision Property Management, LLC, a South
Carolina limited liability company (the " _Asset Seller_ " and together with
the Equity Sellers, the " _Sellers_ "), and (xi) Alexander Szkaradek, in his
capacity as the representative of the Sellers (the " _Sellers '
Representative_"). Parent, Acquisition Sub, Sellers' Representative and
Sellers are sometimes individually referred to in this Agreement as a "
_Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

  



  

BACKGROUND

  



  

WHEREAS, the Sellers own one hundred percent (100%) of the equity interests
of each of the entities (collectively, the " _Equity Interests_ ") listed on
Schedule I (the " _Entities_ ", each individually, an " _Entity_ ") and all
of the Transferred Assets and Liabilities;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Sellers wish to sell to Acquisition Sub and Acquisition Sub
wishes to purchase from the Sellers, the Equity Interests and Transferred
Assets and Liabilities for the Purchase Price and upon the terms and subject
to the conditions hereinafter set forth (the " _Transaction_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that the transfer of the Equity Interests and
Transferred Assets in exchange for Common Stock and Preferred Stock pursuant
to this Agreement, be part of the same plan, for purposes of Section 351 of
the Code, as the transfer of assets by certain transferors to Parent in
exchange for shares of Parent stock within the twelve (12) month period
following the date hereof (" _Other Transfers_ "). If Parent reasonably
determines that the shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued to
Equity Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, together with shares of Parent
stock that is owned or will be issued to transferors pursuant to the Other
Transfers, in the aggregate represent 80% or more of the total combined voting
power of all Parent's voting stock, and 80% or more of the total number of
shares of each other class of stock of Parent, Parent will treat the
transfers of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock pursuant to this Agreement
as issued in a transaction qualifying under Section 351 of the Code.

thereof) thereto or thereunder so that Parent or Acquisition Sub would not in
fact receive all such rights, each Party will enter into any arrangement
reasonably requested by the other Party under which (i) Parent or
Acquisition Sub would, in compliance with Law, receive the benefits and

2.4   _Purchase Price Determination._

  



  

(a)   _Closing Date Purchase Price Determination_. At least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to
Parent and Acquisition Sub a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth the Sellers' good faith, reasonably detailed calculations of
Estimated Entities' Indebtedness, Estimated Net Working Capital and
Estimated Transaction Expenses. The Sellers represent and warrant to the
Parent and Acquisition Sub that the Estimated Closing Statement has been
prepared based upon the books and records of the Companies on a modified
accrual basis consistent with prior periods.

  



  

(b)   _Post-Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustments_. As
promptly as practicable, but no later than one hundred twenty (120)
days after the Closing, Parent shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
the Sellers' Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth Parent's calculation of the Purchase Price and reasonably detailed
calculations demonstrating each component thereof, including the Base
Purchase Price, Entities' Indebtedness, Net Working Capital and Transaction
Expenses.

  



  

(c)  Dispute Resolution Procedures.

  



  

(i)  If the Sellers' Representative disagrees with Parent's
calculation of Base Purchase Price, Transferred Liabilities and Entities'
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital or Transaction Expenses as set forth in the
Closing Statement delivered pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ , the Sellers'
Representative may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the
Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "), deliver a written notice to
Parent setting forth the Sellers' Representative's calculation of the items
and amounts in dispute (the " _Objection Notice_ "). Any such notice of
disagreement shall specify all items or amounts as to which the Sellers'
Representative disagrees, and the Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to
have agreed with the calculation of all other items and amounts set forth in
the Closing Statement.

  



  

(ii)  If an Objection Notice shall be properly delivered pursuant
to _Section 2.4(c)(i)_, the Sellers' Representative and Parent shall, during
the fifteen (15) days following such delivery, negotiate in good faith the
disputed items or amounts. The matters set forth in any written resolution
executed by the Sellers' Representative and Parent shall be final and
binding on the parties on the date of such written resolution.

  



  

(iii)  If the Sellers' Representative and Parent are unable to
reach such agreement during such fifteen (15) day period, they shall promptly
thereafter submit any matters in dispute to a regionally recognized firm of
certified public accountants or other financial organization appointed by the
mutual agreement of Parent and Sellers' Representative (the " _Independent
Accountant_ ") for resolution. The Independent Accountant shall only
determine the specific items under dispute, with respect to each
specific item or amount in dispute, and shall determine an amount which is no
higher than the highest number submitted by either Parent or the Sellers'
Representative or which is no lower than the lowest number submitted by either
Parent or the Sellers' Representative, and shall base its determinations
solely on written submissions by Parent and the Sellers' Representative (or
by in-person or telephonic conferences if mutually agreed to by Parent, the
Sellers' Representative and the Independent Accountant). The Independent
Accountant shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative and Parent, as
promptly as practicable, a written report as to the resolution of each
disputed item and the resulting computation of the Purchase Price. Such report
shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and shall not be subject to
further review or appeal (absent manifest arithmetical error). The
Independent Accountant shall consider only those items and amounts in the
Sellers' Representative's and Parent's respective calculations of
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital or Transaction Expenses, each as of the
applicable Determination Time, including each of the components thereof, that
are identified as being items and amounts to which the
Sellers' Representative and Parent have been unable to agree; provided,
however, that other items that may be impacted by the resolution of the
disputed items may be adjusted as necessary by the Independent Accountants.
The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by the
Sellers, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, based on the inverse
of the percentage of the amounts that the Independent Accountant determines
in such party's favor bears to the aggregate amount of the total items in
dispute as originally submitted to Independent Accountant. For example,
should the aggregate items in dispute total $1,000 and the
Independent Accountant awards $600 in favor of the Sellers' Representative's
position, sixty percent (60%) of the costs of its review would be borne by
Parent and forty percent (40%) of the costs would be borne by the Sellers.

Closing Statement_ ") (A) at the end of the Review Period if the Sellers'
Representative has not delivered an Objection Notice to Parent by such time,
(B) with such changes as are necessary to reflect matters resolved pursuant
to any written resolution executed pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)(ii)_, on the
date such resolution is executed and delivered, if all outstanding matters are
resolved through such resolution or (C) with such changes as are necessary to
reflect the Independent Accountant's resolution of the matters in dispute
(together with any changes necessary to reflect matters previously resolved
pursuant to any written resolution executed pursuant to _Section
2.4(c)(ii) _and any matters not disputed pursuant to a notice of
disagreement), on the date the Independent Accountant delivers its
final, binding determination pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)(iii)_.

  



  

(d)  Net Adjustment Amount. Upon final determination of the
Purchase Price as provided in _Section 2.4(c)_ (the " _Final Purchase Price_
"):

  



  

(i)  if the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, Parent shall,
as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
following the determination of the Final Purchase Price as provided in
_Section 2.4(c)_, release the entire Holdback Amount to the Sellers, and
Parent shall issue additional Preferred Stock with an aggregate value equal to
the Net Adjustment Amount to the Sellers;

  



  

(ii)  if the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, then Parent
shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following the determination of the Final Purchase Price as
provided in _Section 2.4(c)_, release to Sellers the greater of (a) that
portion of the Holdback Amount equal to (x) the Holdback Amount _less_ (y) the
absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount, and (b) zero;

  



  

(iii)  if the Net Adjustment Amount is zero, then Parent shall, as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
following the determination of the Final Purchase Price as provided in

agent are entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and

Documents, any withholding Taxes or other amounts required to be deducted and
withheld pursuant to the Code or any applicable Law. Any amount deducted and
withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement and any Transaction Document, as applicable, as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

2.6   _Limitation on Parent Shares; Exemption from Registration._

  



  

(a)  Any adjustments made to the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Agreement that would result in an increase to the Purchase Price, shall
result in additional Preferred Stock being issued to the Sellers.

  



  

(b)  The Parent Securities to be issued in connection with this
Agreement shall be issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the
Securities Act, by reason of Section 4(a)(2) thereof and/or Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act and may not be re-offered or resold
other than in conformity with the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and such other laws or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The
certificates issued by Parent with respect to the Parent Securities issued
hereunder shall be legended to the effect described above and shall include
such additional legends as necessary to comply with applicable U.S. federal
securities laws, and Blue Sky laws and to reflect the transfer restrictions
set forth in _Section 4.7(b)_ hereof..

  



  

(c)  All Sellers agree to execute such documents as Parent may
reasonably determine to be necessary to ensure that the Parent Securities to
be issued in connection with this Agreement are issued in a transaction exempt
from registration under the Securities Act, by reason of Section 4(a)(2)
thereof and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

(iii)  Sellers intend to and shall be permitted to transfer $10
million in aggregate stated value of the Closing Preferred Stock to
Sellers' financial advisors; provided that (1) no portion of such stock will
be transferred, directly or indirectly, to a Singal Party (as defined below),
and (2) any such transfer shall be made in compliance with applicable
securities laws (which may include Section 4(a)(7) of the Securities Act or
so-called Rule 4(a)(1½) thereunder, both of which require that the transferees
be accredited investors).

  



  

(b)   _Restriction on Transfer_. Sellers agree not to transfer
any of the Equity Consideration to Suneet Singal (" _Singal_ ") nor any
family member or affiliate or associate (with "affiliate" and "associate"
having the meanings given under Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934) of Singal (Singal and any of his current or future family
members, affiliates or associates being herein referred to as a " _Singal
Party_ "), and any transfer of any of the Equity Securities (or any
successive transfers) other than a Qualified Disposition (as defined below)
shall be subject to the same restriction. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Sellers may transfer any or all of the Common Stock Consideration plus up to
$83 million in aggregate stated value of the Closing Preferred Stock to one
or more trusts (each, a " _Vision Trust_ ") of which Alex and/or Antoni are
the sole trustee(s), and under which the sole beneficiaries are: (i) with
respect to up to $15 million in aggregate stated value of the Preferred
Stock, Singal or an entity designated by him, and (ii) with respect to any or
all of the Common Stock Consideration plus up to $68 million in aggregate
stated value of the Closing Preferred Stock, the common shareholders of First
Capital Real Estate Trust, Inc.; provided, however, that Singal shall not be
permitted to have or share any voting or dispositive power over any assets
held by any Vision Trust and no Singal Party shall be permitted to serve as a
trustee of a Vision Trust or receive any shares of capital stock of the
Parent (or any voting or other beneficial interest in any such shares) from a
Vision Trust, except that the common shareholders of First Capital Real
Estate Trust, Inc. may receive shares of capital stock of the Parent in a pro
rata distribution from a Vision Trust so long as such distribution is either
registered pursuant to the Securities Act or is exempt from such registration
(a " _Permitted Spin-off "_). The Parent does not undertake any obligation to
register any shares for such purpose. Any distribution, sale or other transfer
of any shares of capital stock of the Parent (or any voting or other
beneficial interest in any such shares) by a Vision Trust, other than pursuant
to (a) a Permitted Spin-off, (b) a public offering pursuant to a registration
statement filed and declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) a sale
pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 144(i) under the Securities Act (any
disposition of shares described in any of the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or
(c) being herein referred to as a " _Qualified Disposition_ ") shall be
conditioned upon the distributee, purchaser or other transferee executing
such documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Company in its
sole discretion evidencing such distributee's, purchaser's or other
transferee's agreement to a substantially identical restriction on transfer,
namely providing that no Singal Party shall be permitted to acquire any such
shares (or any voting or other beneficial interest in any such shares) other
than pursuant to a Qualified Disposition. The same transfer restrictions and
documentation requirement shall be imposed upon successive distributees,
purchasers or other transferees of such shares. Any shares
transferred pursuant to a Qualified Disposition shall no longer be subject to
the transfer restrictions set forth in this _Section 4.7(b)_.

  



  

(c)   _Accredited Investor_. Seller is an accredited investor
within the meaning of Rule 501(a) Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act.

restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

6.5   _Confidentiality_. The Sellers recognizes that by reason of
their ownership of the Equity Interests and its operation of the Business of

information and trade secrets concerning VPM Holdings and the Companies, the
use or disclosure of which could cause Parent and Acquisition Sub and,
following the Closing, the Companies, substantial loss and damages.
Accordingly, the Sellers covenants to the Parent and Acquisition Sub that the
Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Companies) shall not, except

confidential information relating to VPM Holdings or the Companies, unless (a)
it is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
disclosure by the Sellers or their Affiliates, (b) it is generally made
available to third parties without limitations on its disclosure, or (c)
disclosure is required by applicable Law. In the event that the Sellers are
required by applicable Law to disclose any confidential information or trade
secrets regarding VPM Holdings or the Companies, the Sellers will not make
any disclosure until, to the extent practicable and legally permissible, the
Sellers' Representative or applicable Seller first notifies Parent promptly
so that Parent may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in
Parent's sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement
(and if Parent seeks such an order, the Sellers will not oppose such efforts
and the Sellers will provide such cooperation (at Parent's sole expense) as
Parent reasonably requests); thereafter, disclosures may occur only as
allowed herein. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is
obtained, or that Parent waives compliance with the terms of this Agreement,
and that the Sellers are nonetheless legally compelled to make such
disclosures, the Sellers will (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
furnish only that portion of the confidential information or trade secrets
regarding VPM Holdings or the Company that the Sellers are advised by counsel
is legally required, (ii) to the extent practicable and legally permissible,
give Parent written notice of the disclosures to be made, and (iii)
exercise all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded the information so disclosed.

preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the business of the
Companies for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date (or longer if
required by applicable Law) and shall make such records available (upon
reasonable advance prior written request and during normal business hours) to
the other parties or any of their respective equity holders as may be
reasonably required by the Sellers, on the one hand, or Parent and the
Companies, on the other hand, in connection with, among other things, any Tax
filings, any insurance claims and any Legal Proceedings, in order to enable a
party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and each of
Transaction Documents to which it is a party. No party shall be required to
provide any such access to the extent such access would violate applicable
Law or would be reasonably likely to result in the waiver of any attorney-
client or other evidentiary privilege; _provided_ , that subject to advice of
outside counsel that to do so would violate applicable Law, the parties shall
enter into a joint defense or common interest agreement, in which event the
other party shall provide such access notwithstanding the availability of any
attorney-client or other evidentiary privilege. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or limit the ability of
Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Companies to liquidate, dissolve, merge,
amalgamate, sell, contribute or otherwise dispose of (whether equity, assets
or otherwise) or undertake a fundamental transaction with respect to the
Companies following the Closing.

  



  

6.7   _Publicity_. From and after the date hereof, neither
Parent, Acquisition Sub nor the Sellers shall, directly or indirectly, issue

applicable Law and only to the extent required by such Law; _provided_ , that
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Sellers will be entitled to communicate with

shall not take any position inconsistent with such tax treatment or the Tax
Allocation Statement in any Tax Return or in any administrative or judicial
proceeding relating to Taxes, unless otherwise required pursuant to a final
determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code). The parties hereto
agree that the Tax Allocation Statement determined in accordance with this
_Section 6.8(a) _ shall be binding upon Sellers and Parent for all Tax
reporting purposes. If there is an increase or decrease in the
Aggregate Consideration based upon an adjustment thereto in accordance with
this Agreement within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1060-1(e)(ii)(B) after the parties hereto have filed the initial
IRS Form 8594, the parties hereto shall revise the Tax Allocation Statement
accordingly.

  



  

(b)   _Tax Returns_. The Sellers shall timely prepare or cause
to be prepared and timely file or cause to be filed all income Tax Returns of
each of the Companies for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date.
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past
practice and custom of the Companies in preparing Tax Returns. The Sellers'
Representative shall provide for the Parent, for its review and comment, a
copy of any such Tax Return at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the
date such Tax Return is due. The Sellers shall pay all Taxes with respect to
such Tax Returns and the income with respect thereto. The income of each of
the Companies and their Subsidiaries shall be apportioned to the period up to
and including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by
closing the books of each of the Companies and their Subsidiaries as of the
end of the Closing Date.

  



  

(c)   _Other Tax Returns_. Parent shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed (i) all non-income Tax Returns of the
Companies for periods ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax
Returns_ ") and (ii) all Tax Returns for periods beginning on or before, and
ending after, the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period Tax Return_ ," and such
periods, " _Straddle Periods_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in
accordance with the past practice and custom of the Companies in preparing
Tax Returns, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent shall
provide to the Sellers' Representative, for their review, a copy of any such
Tax Return at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the date such Tax
Return is due. The Sellers' Representative shall provide comments at least
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the date such Tax Return is due. Parent
shall give due regard to proposed revisions to any such Tax Return as
reasonably requested by the Sellers' Representative. In the event there is a
disagreement as to whether revisions requested by the Sellers' Representative
should be included in any such Tax Return, the disagreement shall be submitted
to the Independent Accountant for resolution (the expenses of which shall be
shared in a manner similar to that set forth in _Section 2.4(c)(iii)_
). Parent shall file such Tax Returns as so finally prepared (including the
resolution of the Independent Accountant, if applicable). The Sellers shall
pay all Taxes with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Returns, and with respect to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (as determined
pursuant to _Section 6.4(e)_ ) with respect to Straddle Period Tax Returns,
within five (5) days of demand therefor by Parent.

(d)   _Straddle Period Taxes_. If the Companies are permitted
but not required under applicable Law to treat the Closing Date as the last
day of a taxable period, then the parties shall treat that day as the last day
of a taxable period. In the case of any Taxes with respect to a Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of Taxes other than
those based on income, receipts or expenses (e.g., payroll Taxes), be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based on
income, receipts or expenses, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the Straddle Period ended as of the end of the Closing Date (and
for such purposes, the taxable period of any partnership or pass-through
shall be deemed to terminate at such time); _provided_ , _however_ , that
items determined on an annual or periodic basis (such as deductions for
depreciation) shall be apportioned on a daily basis.

  



  

(e)   _Cooperation_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Sellers
shall, and shall each cause their Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, provide to
the other such cooperation and information, as and to the extent reasonably
requested, in connection with the filing of any Tax Return, determining
liability for Taxes or in conducting any audit, litigation or other Legal
Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns
and related documents, and making its employees available, to the extent
reasonably requested.

  



  

(f)   _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax
allocation or sharing agreements, if any, binding any of the Companies
shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and none of the Companies shall be
obligated to make any payment to any Person thereunder for any period.

  



  

(g)   _Transfer Taxes_. To the extent any transfer are required
to be paid in connection with this Transaction pursuant to applicable such
Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the Sellers. Parent shall timely file, to the
extent required by applicable Law, all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and provide to the
Sellers' Representative copies of such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  



  

6.9   _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a)   _Post-Closing Employment Arrangements - Transferred
Employees_. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Acquisition Sub shall extend, or shall cause its Affiliates to extend,
employment offers to each Business Employee who is actively employed
immediately prior to the Closing Date and who Acquisition Sub, in its sole
discretion, lists on _Schedule 6.10(a)_ , with such employment to be
effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date. Such employment offers shall
satisfy the following requirements for a period of at least 12 months
following the Closing Date: (i) substantially the same duties and
responsibilities (unless such Business Employee consents to enhanced duties
and responsibilities), (ii) at least the same level of base pay, (iii) the
same crediting of years of service (including any portions thereof credited by
Sellers), and (iv) bonus potential and other compensation and benefits that
are no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Acquisition Sub, but in no event less favorable than such
employee's existing bonus potential and other compensation and benefits,
all as in effect with respect to the applicable Business Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date and in all cases in compliance with applicable Law.
The Business Employees who accept Acquisition Sub's offer of employment shall
be referred to herein as " _Transferred Employees_ ".

(b)  Effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, the
Transferred Employees shall cease all active participation in and accrual of
benefits under the Plans (the " _Retained Plans_ "). Sellers shall retain
sponsorship of, and shall retain and indemnify and hold harmless Acquisition
Sub and its Affiliates against, all Liabilities under the Retained Plans,
whether arising before, on or after the Closing, and Acquisition Sub and its
Affiliates shall not assume sponsorship of, contribute to or maintain, or
have any Liability with respect to, the Retained Plans.

  



  

(c)  Except as would result in a duplication of benefits for the
same period of service, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting
and, solely for the purposes of vacation, paid-time-off and/or severance
plans, level of benefits under the employee benefit plans of Acquisition Sub
and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Transferred Employees after the
Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), Acquisition Sub shall cause each Transferred
Employee to receive credit for all service with Sellers before the Closing
(including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities with respect
to which Sellers has given credit for prior service) to the extent recognized
in any similar Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
crediting shall not apply to defined benefit, equity or equity derivative or
non-qualified deferred compensation plans.

  



  

(d)  Sellers shall pay to each Transferred Employee all amounts
in respect of vacation days and other paid time off accrued but not taken by
such Transferred Employee on or prior to the Closing. Acquisition Sub shall
have no obligation to honor such accrued vacation days or paid time off after
the Closing. Following the Closing, the Transferred Employees' eligibility for
vacation and other paid time off shall be determined under Acquisition Sub's
vacation policy.

  



  

(e)  Acquisition Sub agrees to cause a defined contribution plan
that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code (and a related trust exempt from tax under Section
501(a) of the Code) (as applicable, the " _Acquisition Sub 401(k) Plan_ ") to
allow each Transferred Employee to make a "direct rollover" to the
Acquisition Sub 401(k) Plan of the account balances of such Transferred
Employee (but not including promissory notes evidencing any outstanding
loans) under the Plan that is a defined contribution plan that includes a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k)
of the Code (a " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") in which such Transferred
Employee participated prior to the Closing if such Seller 401(k) Plan permits
such a direct rollover and if such direct rollover is elected in accordance
with applicable Law by such Transferred Employee. The rollovers described
herein shall comply with applicable Law, and each party shall make all
filings and take any actions required of such party under applicable Law in
connection therewith. Acquisition Sub shall have no responsibility for any
failure of Sellers to properly administer the Seller 401(k) Plan in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including without limitation
any failure to properly administer the accounts of Transferred Employees and
their beneficiaries who effect a direct rollover pursuant to this _Section
6.10(e)_.

(f)  If not already paid by the Sellers prior to the Closing,
the Sellers shall make a bonus payment to the Transferred Employee for the
period ended on the Closing Date. Sellers may determine such bonus amount
using any good faith methodology (which need not be the same for each
Transferred Employee), including, without limitation, by basing such amount
upon target bonus or upon actual performance.

  



  

(g)  Each Transferred Employee will be eligible to participate
immediately, without any waiting time, in any New Plan to the extent coverage
under such New Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Plan in
which such Transferred Employee participated immediately before the Closing,
and for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical,
vision and/or disability benefits to any Transferred Employee, Acquisition
Sub shall cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively at work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Transferred Employee and
his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or
requirements were waived or were inapplicable under a similar or comparable
Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated immediately before the
Closing, and shall cause any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by such Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the similar or comparable Plan in which
such Transferred Employee participated immediately before the Closing ending
on the date such Transferred Employee's participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, in each case to the
extent all information reasonably necessary to implement such actions has been
received from Sellers.

  



  

(h)  Sellers shall pay, perform or otherwise discharge, as the
same shall become due and payable, in accordance with their respective terms,
each of the following, without duplication (the " _Excluded Employee
Liabilities_ "):

  



  

(i)  any Liabilities relating to current or former employees
of Sellers who are not Business Employees or who are not Transferred
Employees (or their respective covered family members); and

  



  

(ii)  any Liabilities relating to Business Employees and Business
Contractors (or their covered family members) that arise as a result of an
event or events that occurred prior to 12:01 am on the Closing Date
(including, without limitation, any and all Liabilities (including statutory
or contractual severance benefits) arising as a result of the actual or
constructive termination of a Business Employee's employment with Sellers as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

  



  

(i)  Acquisition Sub shall pay, perform or otherwise
discharge, as the same shall become due and payable, in accordance with
their respective terms, any Liabilities relating to Transferred Employees (or
their covered family members), that arise as a result of an event or events
that occurred on or after 12:01 am on the Closing Date (the " _Assumed
Employee Liabilities_ ").

(j)  Sellers shall be solely responsible for compliance with
the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle I of
ERISA, including provision of continuation coverage (within the meaning of
COBRA), with respect to all Business Employees, and their respective eligible
spouses and dependents, for whom a qualifying event (within the meaning of
COBRA) occurs at any time on or prior to the Closing Date (including
qualifying events that occur in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby).

  



  

(k)  Nothing contained in this _Section 6.10_ , whether express
or implied, may be construed to (i) create any third party beneficiary or
other rights in any person other than the parties to this Agreement, (ii)
constitute an establishment, amendment, modification or termination of, or an
undertaking to establish, amend, modify or terminate, any Plan, New Plan or
other benefit or compensation plan, (iii) prohibit or limit the ability of
Sellers, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to establish,
amend, modify or terminate any Plan, New Plan or other benefit or
compensation plan, or (iv) create any obligation on the part of
Acquisition Sub or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, to continue to
employ or engage for the performance of services any person (including any
Transferred Employee), or to limit the ability of Acquisition Sub or any of
its Affiliates to terminate the employment or service of any person at any
time for any or no reason.

(a)  Effective as of the Closing, each of the Sellers hereby,

none of the Releasors is releasing or discharging the Releasees from the
obligations and agreements of the Releasees, if any, established pursuant to
this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

  



  

(b)  The Sellers hereby irrevocably covenant to refrain from,
directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand or

continuing obligation to the other. For the avoidance of doubt,
understandings or Contracts entered into by either of the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates, other than any Company, with a third party, shall not be

Acquisition Sub within three (3) days of the date of termination, unless this
Agreement was properly terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(c) _ by virtue of
a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Acquisition Sub, in which event the
Deposit will be retained by the Sellers as its sole and exclusive remedy for
such breach.

  



  

6.15   _Clawback_ *. If (a)(i) the Guaranteed Indebtedness is not
repaid or refinanced, (ii) the Guarantee Agreements are not terminated or

7.2   _Indemnification._

  



  

(a)  From and after the Closing, the Sellers hereby agree to
indemnify and hold Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Companies and their
respective direct and indirect equity holders, directors, managers and
officers (collectively, the " _Acquisition Sub Indemnified Parties_ ")
harmless from, against and in respect of, any and all Losses which may be
sustained, suffered or incurred by, or imposed on, any of them to the extent
resulting from, related to or arising out of: (i) any misrepresentation or
any breach of warranty made by the Sellers in this Agreement or in any
Transaction Document; (ii) any breach of, or failure to fully and timely
comply with, any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Sellers set forth in
this Agreement or in any Transaction Document; (iii) Pre-Closing Liabilities,
(iv) Pre-Closing Taxes, (v) any Excluded Liabilities, (vi) any Indebtedness
for which no Outstanding Indebtedness Letter has been delivered by Sellers,
(vii) any Transaction Expenses not included on the Payment
Allocation Schedule (viii) any of the matters set forth on _Schedule 3.3(a)_
, _Schedule 3.15(a)_ , _Schedule 3.15(b)_ or _Schedule 4.4_ , and (ix) the
Rehab Properties. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the representations, warranties and covenants of the Sellers, and the
Parent's and Acquisition Sub's right to indemnification with respect
thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Parent or Acquisition Sub or by
reason of the fact that the Parent or Acquisition Sub knew or should have
known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate
or by reason of the Parent's or Acquisition Sub's waiver of any condition set
forth in  _Section 2.3_ or _Section 8.1_ , as the case may be.

  



  

(b)  From and after the Closing, Acquisition Sub hereby agrees
to indemnify and hold the Sellers, their Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors and equity holders (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from, against and in respect of any
and all Losses which may be sustained, suffered or incurred by, or imposed on,
any of them to the extent resulting from, related to or arising out of (i)
any misrepresentation in any representation or any breach of warranty made
by Acquisition Sub in this Agreement or in any Transaction Document or (ii)
any breach of, or failure to fully and timely comply with, any covenant,
agreement or obligation of Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in this
Agreement or in any Transaction Document.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, all
"material", "Material Adverse Effect" and similar materiality type
qualifications in the representations and warranties shall be ignored and not
given any effect for purposes of determining (i) whether there is any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty and (ii) the amount of any Loss which
may be claimed pursuant to this _Article 7_ in connection with any such
misrepresentation or breach.

  



  

7.3   _Claims Procedure; Participation in Litigation._

  



  

(a)   _Certain Definitions_. For purposes hereof, a party
claiming a right to indemnification shall be referred to as the "
_Indemnified Party_ ", the party against whom such indemnification claim is
made shall be referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_ " and written notices
from an Indemnified Party to an Indemnifying Party which sets forth one or
more Claims for indemnification under _Article 7_ for Losses shall each be
referred to as a " _Claim Notice_ ".

  



  

(b)   _Procedure for Direct Claims_. Any Claim (other than a
Third-Party Claim covered by _Section 7.3(c)_) by an Indemnified Party on
account of a Loss that has been or may be sustained, suffered or incurred by,
or imposed on, the Indemnified Party (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be asserted
by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , any delay or failure to give such a Claim Notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations
except and only to the extent, if at all, that the Indemnifying Party has been
materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure. Each Claim Notice
shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable to do so, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have twenty (20) days after its receipt of a Claim Notice to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim and, failing a written response, or if the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree that an Indemnified Party
is entitled to recover any amounts pursuant to this Agreement then the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver such amounts by wire transfer of
immediately available U.S. Dollars to an account designated by the
Indemnified Party.

  



  

   

 | \- 42 -| 
---|---|---

---|---|--- 

    



  

(c)  Procedure for Third-Party Claims.

  



  

(i)  In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a
claim from a third-party which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may
result in any Losses (without giving effect to the limitations in _Section
7.5_) (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim by delivery of a Claim Notice to
such Indemnifying Party. Any delay or failure in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of obligations
under  _Section 7.2_ except and only to the extent, if at all, that such
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or
failure.

  



  

(ii)  The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by
delivery of written notice to the Indemnified Party irrevocably
acknowledging the Indemnifying Party's obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for the full amount of Losses arising from such Third-
Party Claim, within twenty (20) days following the receipt of the applicable
Claim Notice, to control the defense, negotiation or settlement of a Third-
Party Claim, and be represented by counsel of its choice (subject to the
reasonable approval of the Indemnified Party), in each case at its sole cost
and expense; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume or control the defense of a Third-Party Claim unless (A) it
acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Parties for any
Losses incurred by them, (B) the Third-Party Claim seeks only monetary
damages, (C) the Third-Party Claim does not involve any allegation or fraud
or violation of Law and (D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 7.3_, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent
of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit
a default or consent to entry of any judgment with respect thereto unless
such settlement, compromise or judgment includes only the payment of monetary
damages in an amount to be covered in its entirety by the Indemnifying Party,
contains an unqualified release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
in respect of the Third-Party Claim, does not impose any material
obligations or restrictions on any of the Indemnified Party and, in the case
of a claim by the Acquisition Sub Indemnified Parties, cannot reasonably be
expected to result in a material Tax Liability for taxable periods (or
portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. If the Indemnifying Party
does not elect to control, or is otherwise not controlling the defense,
negotiation or settlement of a particular Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may defend against, negotiate, settle (subject to the approval of

7.5   _Limitations_. The rights of the Acquisition Sub
Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this 
_Section 7.5_ are subject to the following limitations:

  



  

(a)  The Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify any
Acquisition Sub Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ , unless
and until the aggregate amount of all Losses suffered or incurred by all
Acquisition Sub Indemnified Parties which would otherwise be subject to
indemnification hereunder exceeds $500,000. (the " _Deductible_ "), at which
time such Acquisition Sub Indemnified Parties shall be entitled, subject to
the terms and conditions of this _Article 7_ (including the limitations on
indemnification set forth herein), to be indemnified against all Losses that
exceed the Deductible; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Deductible shall
not apply to indemnification for Losses arising from any breach of any of the
Fundamental Representations or claims based on fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article
7_ , the maximum amount of Losses for which the Acquisition Sub Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification from the Sellers pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the Purchase Price
(the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap shall not apply to
indemnification for Losses arising from any breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations or claims based on fraud or intentional misrepresentation. In
the event of indemnification for Losses arising from any breach of any of the
Fundamental Representations, the maximum amount of indemnification for losses
in the aggregate, shall not exceed an amount equal to 100% of the Purchase
Price.

  



  

(c)  All Losses suffered by the Acquisition Sub Indemnified
Parties pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be recovered from each Seller,
such number of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (rounded up or down
to the nearest whole share) equal to such Seller's pro rata percentage of the
Common Stock and Preferred Stock as set forth on the Payment Allocation
Schedule multiplied by an amount equal to the amount set forth in the Claim
Notice or the resolved amount (as applicable) divided by the appropriate per
share value of Common Stock and Preferred Stock (the " _Indemnity Cancelled
Parent Shares_ ") shall be returned to Parent, deemed to be cancelled and all
rights such Seller may have to such Common Stock and Preferred Stock shall be
extinguished. For the purposes of this _Section 7.5(c)_ , calculations
intended to determine the number of shares of Common Stock applicable to a
claim for indemnification under this _Section 7.5(c)_ shall be made using the
average of the closing price of the Common Stock reported by the New York
Stock Exchange for the ten trading days immediately prior to the Closing
Date and all calculations shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole
share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Acquisition Sub
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement with respect to any Losses to the extent that such Losses were
actually taken into consideration in determining the Net Adjustment Amount.

(d)  If any Acquisition Sub Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party receives insurance proceeds as a result of any Losses
with respect to which it has also received an indemnification payment or
payments from the Sellers or Acquisition Sub, as the case may be, hereunder,
the Acquisition Sub Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnified Party shall
pay the amount of such insurance proceeds (net of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred to obtain such insurance proceeds or any increase in premiums
resulting from the receipt of such insurance proceeds, and in no event in
excess of the indemnification payment or payments actually received from the
Acquisition Sub or the Sellers, as the case may be, with respect to such
Losses hereunder) to such party as such insurance proceeds are actually
received by the Acquisition Sub Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnified
Party, as the case may be.

  



  

7.6   _Exclusive Remedies_. After the Closing, the rights set
forth in this _Article 7_ , _Section 2.4(c)_ , and _Section 2.4(d)_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedies available to Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates with respect to any claims under this
