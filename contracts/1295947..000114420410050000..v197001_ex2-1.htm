other purposes set forth in this Section 3.1, in each case, without cost to
the Sellers.

 

 

(iii) Unless otherwise provided for herein or agreed upon by the Buyer and
the Sellers' Representative, the Estimated Closing Statement, the Proposed
Closing Statement and the Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with the same accounting
principles, policies, methodologies or procedures (the "Accounting
Policies") used in preparing the Latest Balance Sheet.

 

 

(iv) In the event the Sellers' Representative disputes any aspect of the
Proposed Closing Statement, the Sellers' Representative shall notify the
Buyer in writing of its objections within forty-five (45) days after receipt
of the Proposed Closing Statement and shall set forth, in writing and in
reasonable detail, the reasons for the Sellers' Representative's objections
(a "Notice of Disagreement").

 

 

(v) During the fifteen (15) days immediately following the delivery of any
Notice of Disagreement (or such longer period as may be agreed in writing by
the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative), the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they
may have with respect to any matter specified in such Notice of Disagreement.
During such period, the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall each have
access to the other Party's working papers, trial balances and similar
materials prepared in connection with the other Party's preparation of the
Proposed Closing Statement and the Notice of Disagreement, as the case may
be.

 

 

(vi) If, at the end of such period specified in Section 3.1(d)(v), the Buyer
and the Sellers' Representative have not been able to resolve, in writing,
all differences that they may have with respect to any matter specified in
such Notice of Disagreement, the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall
submit to Deloitte and Touche LLP (the "Accounting Firm") for review and
resolution of any and all matters that remain in dispute (and as to no other
matter), and the Accounting Firm shall reach a final, binding resolution of
all matters that remain in dispute, which final resolution shall not be
subject to collateral attack for any reason (other than fraud) and shall be
(u) in writing, within the range of the amount contested by the
Sellers' Representative and the Buyer and signed by the Accounting Firm, (v)
furnished to the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative as soon as practicable
after the items in dispute have been referred to the Accounting Firm, which
the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer shall request not to be more than
thirty (30) days after such referral, (w) made in accordance with this
Agreement and (x) conclusive and binding upon the Parties on the date of
delivery of such written resolution. The Buyer

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

and the Sellers' Representative agree to execute, if requested by the
Accounting Firm, a reasonable engagement letter in customary form and shall
cooperate fully with the Accounting Firm and promptly provide all documents
and information requested by the Accounting Firm so as to enable it to make
such determination as quickly and as accurately as practicable. The procedure
outlined in this Section 3.1(d)(vi) is referred to as the "Dispute
Resolution Procedure".

 

 

(vii) The Proposed Closing Statement shall become the "Final
Closing Statement" (x) on the forty-sixth (46th) day following the receipt of
the Proposed Closing Statement by Sellers' Representative if a Notice
of Disagreement has not been delivered to the Buyer by the Sellers'
Representative, (y) with such changes as are necessary to reflect matters
resolved pursuant to any written resolution executed pursuant to Section
3.1(d)(v) or Section 3.1(d)(vi), on the date such resolution is executed, if
all outstanding matters are resolved through such resolution and (z) with
such changes as are necessary to reflect the Accounting Firm's resolution of
matters in dispute, on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final,
binding resolution pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(vi). The date on which the
Proposed Closing Statement shall become the Final Closing Statement pursuant
to the immediately foregoing sentence is referred to as the "Final
Determination Date".

 

 

(viii) The Buyer, the Sellers' Representative and the Sellers shall each pay
their own costs and expenses incurred in connection with such Dispute
Resolution Procedure; provided, that the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be borne in the same proportion that the Sellers' Representative's
position, on the one hand, and the Buyer's position, on the other hand,
initially presented to the Accounting Firm (based on the aggregate of all
differences taken as a whole) bear to the final resolution as determined by
the Accounting Firm.

 

 

(e) Working Capital Purchase Price Adjustments. If the Working Capital set
forth in the Final Closing Statement (the "Actual Working Capital") is
greater than the Estimated Working Capital, the Buyer shall pay such excess
to or as directed by the Sellers' Representative for the account of the
Sellers, pro rata in accordance with each such Seller's Pro Rata
Share, within five (5) business days of the Final Determination Date, by wire
transfer of immediately available United States funds to an account or
accounts designated by the Sellers' Representative. If the Estimated
Working Capital is greater than the Actual Working Capital, such excess shall
be distributed by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Fund to the Buyer within
five (5) business days of the Final Determination Date.

 

 

(f) Escrow Amount.

 

 

(i) At the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit with U.S. Bank, National
Association (the "Escrow Agent"), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount equal to the Escrow Amount, such amount plus all accumulated
earnings thereon (such amounts, if any, "Escrow Consideration") to
constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the escrow agreement in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Escrow Agreement"), among the
Buyer, the Escrow Agent and the Sellers' Representative.

 

 

(x) The Escrow Fund shall initially consist of a $1,200,000 portion (the
"Working Capital Deficiency Adjustment Fund") and $7,500,000 portion (the
"Indemnification Fund") and shall be used to satisfy any amounts owed to the
Buyer from the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, including Working Capital
adjustments pursuant to Section 3.1(e) and indemnification amounts
owed hereunder. In the event an amount determined pursuant to Section 3.1(e)
for Working Capital is owing to the Buyer (such amount, which shall
equal zero if no amount is owing to the Buyer, the "W/C Release
Amount"), the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall jointly instruct
the Escrow Agent to distribute the W/C Release Amount to the Buyer. To
the extent the W/C Release Amount distributed to the Buyer pursuant to the
preceding sentence is less than the amount of the Working Capital Deficiency
Adjustment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fund, the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to distribute an amount equal to the difference thereof to or as
instructed by the Sellers' Representative for the account of the Sellers, in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. The Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative shall provide such joint instructions timely so
that distributions can be made by the Escrow Agent within the time period
required by Section 3.1(e). The Indemnification Fund shall be used to satisfy
any other amounts owed to the Buyer from the Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement.

 

 

(y) The portion of the Escrow Fund that is not used to satisfy any other
amounts owing to the Buyer and its Affiliates from the Sellers under this
Agreement, including indemnification amounts, or not subject to any claims
hereunder, shall be released to the Sellers' Representative on the date that
is one (1) business day after the expiration of the Indemnification Period;
provided that if there are any claims hereunder that are pending on such
date, the applicable portion of the Escrow Fund that is subject to any such
claims shall not be released to or as instructed by the Sellers'
Representative until such applicable claims are finally resolved and
satisfied. Upon the final release of all the Escrow Fund, the Escrow
Agreement shall terminate. All funds so released from the Escrow Fund to or
as instructed by the Sellers' Representative shall include any Escrow
Consideration and shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to or as
instructed by the Sellers' Representative for the account of the Sellers in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

 

 

(ii) The Sellers acknowledge and agree that none of the Escrow Fund may be
used to reimburse the Sellers' Representative for the services contemplated
by this Agreement, except upon any release that would otherwise be made to
the Sellers' Representative. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund
and shall not be subject to any Lien, and shall be held and disbursed solely
for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(g) Sellers' Expense Amount

 

 

At the Closing, the Buyer shall deposit cash in an amount equal to the
Sellers' Expense Amount into an account designated by the Sellers'
Representative. The Sellers' Expense Amount shall be used to fund any
expenses incurred by the Sellers' Representative in the performance of its
duties and obligations hereunder. The Sellers' Expense Amount will be held by
the Sellers' Representative until such time as the Sellers' Representative
determines, in its sole discretion, that the Sellers shall have no further
expenses to be incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Any portion of the Sellers' Expense Amount remaining
after such date shall be paid by the Sellers' Representative to the Sellers,
with each Seller receiving its Pro Rata Share of such remaining amounts.

the Purchased Shares as contemplated by this Agreement. The Sellers hereby
acknowledge that the consideration stated herein is adequate for the transfer
of the Purchased Shares. The Sellers further agree that they will not raise
as a defense to this Agreement the allegation of lack of consideration after

qualified, as applicable. To the knowledge of Holdco and its

to the knowledge of Holdco and its Subsidiaries, has not, since receipt of

order with respect to such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance.

of Holdco and the Buyer will give written notice to the other Party of any
notice or development of which Holdco or the Buyer, as applicable, has actual
knowledge (without any requirement of inquiry or investigation on the part
thereof) that, if existing or known on the Effective Date, would have been
required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedule (it being

of or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty that otherwise might have
existed and (ii) any such supplemental disclosure, if not material, will be
deemed to have amended or qualified the representations and warranties in
this Agreement and to have cured any breach of or inaccuracy in a
representation or warranty that otherwise might have existed.

Section  8.11

    |  

Exculpation;  Indemnification; Insurance

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a "Claim"),
including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at
any time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before Closing, a
director, member or officer of Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or
was serving at the request of Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, member or officer of another person (in each case,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Holdco Personnel") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole
or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i)
the fact that he is or was a director, member or officer of Holdco or any of
its Subsidiaries before the Closing, or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, whether asserted or arising before or after the Closing, the
parties shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
defend against such Claim and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification
and exculpation (including advancement of expenses) from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to Closing now existing in favor of any
Holdco Personnel or any Seller or Affiliate thereof as provided in the
Charter Documents of Holdco and its Subsidiaries, and any agreements existing
on the date hereof, shall survive the Closing pursuant to their terms.

 

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, at the discretion of the Sellers, Holdco may
purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under Holdco's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage policies (the "DandO
Tail") for the Holdco Personnel in a form acceptable to Holdco. If the
DandO Tail is purchased by Holdco prior to the Closing, then, from and after
the Closing, the Buyer shall, and shall cause Holdco to, maintain the DandO
Tail in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder (it being understood that no premium or other payments shall be
required to be paid by the Buyer thereunder).

 

 

(c) The obligations under this Section 8.11 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Holdco Personnel or any
other Person to whom this Section 8.11 applies without the consent of such
affected Holdco Personnel or other Person (it being expressly agreed that the
Holdco Personnel or other Person to whom this Section 8.11 applies shall be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.11 and shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained herein).

 

 

(d) In the event that Holdco or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Holdco,
as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.11.

Section  8.12

Access  to Employees; Cooperation Throughout the Pre-Closing  Process

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

(a) Subject to Section 8.3(b), from the Effective Date to the Closing Date,
Holdco shall provide the Buyer the opportunity reasonably requested by it to
contact and have access to the employees of Holdco and its Subsidiaries for
pre-Closing introductions, discussions and training sessions.

 

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Holdco shall provide to the Buyer information and
access reasonably requested by it necessary to proceed with customary pre-
Closing integration processes.

 

 

        |  

Section  8.13

    |  

Tax  Matters

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

(a) For any taxable period of Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (any such taxable period, a "Straddle
Period") or that ends on or before the Closing Date for which any Tax Returns
by Holdco and its Subsidiaries are due after the Closing Date (any such
taxable period, a "Prior Period"), the Buyer will timely prepare and file
with the appropriate Taxing Authority all tax returns required to be filed by
Holdco and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Tax Returns") and will pay
all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. The Buyer will furnish such
Tax Returns and related work papers and supporting information to the
Sellers' Representative and its tax advisers for their review and comment at
least sixty (60) days prior to the due date (or extended due date that
has been approved by the Sellers' Representative) for filing such
Tax Returns. Simultaneous with

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

furnishing such Tax Returns to the Sellers' Representative, the Buyer shall
provide a written statement to the Sellers' Representative setting forth the
amount of Taxes owing on such Tax Returns that, in accordance with Section
8.13(c), it believes is owing by the Sellers. Should the Sellers'
Representative disagree with the calculation of Taxes shown as being due on
such Tax Returns or the amount of Taxes owing thereon that the Buyer believes
is owing by the Sellers, it shall provide written notification thereof (such
notice, a "Tax Dispute Notice") to the Buyer within thirty (30) days of the
due date for the filing of such Tax Returns, and the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall cause their respective tax advisers to confer in good
faith to seek to resolve such disagreement to the satisfaction of the Buyer
and the Sellers' Representative. If the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative
are unable to resolve such disagreement within fifteen (15) days after the
date on which the Tax Dispute Notice has been provided, then such
disagreement shall be resolved pursuant to Section 8.13(b) hereof; provided,
however, the Buyer may file the related Tax Return prior to the expiration of
the deadline for the filing thereof notwithstanding the disagreement being
unresolved, with an amended Tax Return to be subsequently prepared and filed
if required by the final resolution of such disagreement. The Sellers shall
not be responsible for any Taxes for a Straddle Period or a Prior Period to
the extent that a liability therefor has been accrued on the Latest Balance
Sheet or included in the computation of Working Capital. To the extent
that the Sellers are responsible for any Taxes for a Straddle Period or a
Prior Period pursuant to this Section 8.13(a) and Section 8.13(c), the Buyer
shall be entitled to payment thereof solely from the Escrow Fund subject to
the provisions of Article IX. The Sellers' Representative shall cooperate,
and shall cause Holdco's tax adviser to cooperate, with the Buyer in the
preparation of Tax Returns of Holdco and its Subsidiaries for the
Prior Period and the Straddle Period.

 

 

 

(b) If at the end of the applicable dispute resolution period no resolution
is reached, either the Buyer or the Sellers' Representative may request that
the disagreement be resolved by the Accounting Firm. The calculation of the
Taxes due and the Party(ies) responsible for the payment thereof shall be
made by such firm within the range of the respective calculations of the
Buyer and the Sellers' Representative and when so made shall be conclusive,
and shall be binding on, and nonappealable by, the Parties. The fees and
disbursements of such firm shall be borne equally by the Parties.

 

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 8.13, Section 9.4,
Section 9.5(d) and Section 9.6(a), the Buyer Indemnitees shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Sellers solely from the Escrow Fund from and against
any loss, damage, liability, or expense, including reasonable fees for
attorneys and consultants, incurred in contesting or otherwise in connection
with (i) any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 7.23 of this Agreement and (ii) the following Taxes, but only to the
extent such Taxes have not been paid prior to the Closing or adequately
provided for by a liability accrued for Taxes on the Latest Balance Sheet
(subsections (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.13(c), the "Tax Losses"): (A)
the non-payment prior to the Closing of Taxes owed by Holdco or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Prior Period and for the portion through the Closing for
any Straddle Period, and (B) the non-payment of Taxes of any other Person
imposed on, but not paid prior to the Closing by such other Person, Holdco or
any of its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant
to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before
the Closing.

 

 

(d) In the case of any Straddle Period, the Taxes of Holdco or any of its
Subsidiaries allocable to pre-Closing taxable periods will be computed as if
such taxable period ended as of the Closing except in the case of Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis and measured by the level of any item, deemed
to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period) the portion allocable to the pre-Closing period
shall be the product of such Taxes multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
period. The Buyer acknowledges that

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

Holdco and/or its Subsidiaries may in their discretion file prior to the
Closing Tax Returns for their fiscal year ended March 31, 2010.

 

 

 

(e) If a party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to this
Section 8.13 (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") and the other party to this
Agreement (the "Tax Indemnified Party") receives notice of any deficiency,
proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute or other
claim with respect to such Taxes which, if determined adversely to the
taxpayer, would be grounds for indemnification under this Section 8.13 (a
"Tax Claim"), the Tax Indemnified Party will promptly notify the Tax
Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim, but the failure to so notify
the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability it may have to the Indemnified Party, except (i) if notice is not
promptly given, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any legal
or accounting costs incurred before such notice is actually given, or any
interest or similar charge accruing between the time notice should have been
given and the time notice is actually given, and (ii) the Tax Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the extent that, but for such failure, the Tax
Indemnifying Party could have avoided all or a portion of the Taxes or other
costs indemnifiable hereunder in question. The notice shall be accompanied by
copies of the notice and other documentation received by the Tax Indemnified
Party.

 

 

(f) With respect to any Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnifying Party will assume and
control all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim and, without
limiting the foregoing, may pursue or forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any applicable
governmental Persons with respect thereto, and may either pay the Tax claimed
and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or
contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that the
Tax Indemnifying Party will consult with the Tax Indemnified Party in the
negotiation and settlement of any Tax Claim and the Tax Indemnifying Party
will not, without the written consent of the Tax Indemnified Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, settle or
compromise any Tax Claim in any manner if such settlement or compromise would
have the effect of increasing the Taxes of the Indemnified Party
("Indemnified Party Tax Increase"), provided, however, that the consent of
the Tax Indemnified Party will not be required if the Tax Indemnifying Party
indemnifies the Tax Indemnified Party for all Tax Losses attributable to such
Indemnified Party Tax Increase; provided, further, that, to the extent that a
Tax Claim relates to a Straddle Period, the Sellers' Representative and the
Buyer will jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any such
Tax Claim.

 

 

(g) The Tax Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party
in contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation will include the retention and
(upon the Tax Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Tax
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant
to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material
provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.

 

 

(h) Neither party will settle or compromise a Tax Claim relating solely to
Taxes of Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period without the
other party's written consent which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. The consent of the Sellers may be exercised
by the Sellers' Representative.

 

 

(i) The Sellers and the Buyer agree that any indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Section 8.13 will be treated by the parties on their Tax
Returns as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, unless a final
determination by a relevant taxing authority causes any such payment not to
be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(j) The Buyer shall, within fifteen (15) days of receipt, pay or cause to be
paid to the Sellers' Representative, for the account of the Sellers, pro rata
in accordance with each Seller's Pro Rata Share, as an increase in the
Purchase Price, all refunds of Taxes and interest thereon received by the
Buyer, any Affiliate of the Buyer, Holdco or any Subsidiary of Holdco with
respect to any net operating loss deduction for the Prior Period or the
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date that is carried back
to a prior taxable year.

 

 

(k) To the extent (A) the Return of Holdco for the taxable year that includes
the Closing Date reflects a net operating loss carryforward (the "Transaction
Tax NOL") or (B) Tax deductions attributable to Transaction Expenses, the
Accrued Bonus Amount, any write-off of deferred financing expenses or any
other expense incurred by Holdco and/or its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Business prior to the Closing or the Transactions are not properly
reflected on a Return for a Prior Period but are reasonably expected to be
reflected on a Return other than a Return for a Prior Period (the "Post-
Closing Transaction Tax Deductions"), then Buyer shall pay to the Sellers'
Representative, for distribution to the Sellers as an increase in the
Purchase Price, within fifteen (15) days of the filing of Holdco's federal
income tax Return for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date, an
amount equal to (x) the Assumed Tax Rate multiplied by (y) the sum of the
Transaction Tax NOL and the Post-Closing Transaction Tax Deductions. For
purposes of this Section 8.13(k) and Section 9.6(a), the Assumed Tax Rate
shall equal thirty-eight percent (38%).

 

 

(l) The representations, warranties and obligations contained in or made
pursuant to Section 7.23 and this Section 8.13 shall survive for the duration
of the Indemnification Period.

Section  8.14

    |  

Release

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

Effective upon the Closing, each Seller hereby irrevocably waives, releases
and discharges forever Holdco and each of its Subsidiaries from any and all
liabilities and obligations to, and agreements with, such Seller of any kind
or nature whatsoever, whether in his, her or its capacity as a Seller
hereunder, as a stockholder, director, officer or employee of Holdco or any
of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, in each case whether absolute or
contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, and whether arising under any
agreement or understanding or otherwise at Law or equity, and each Seller
hereby covenants and agrees that it, he or she will not seek to recover any
amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from Holdco or any of its
Subsidiaries. However, the foregoing shall not apply to claims to payments
and other rights and remedies of any Seller (a) under, or as contemplated by,
this Agreement, including, without limitation, Article II, Section 8.11 and
Article IX, (b) if such Seller is or was an employee, officer or director of
Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries, (i) under any Employment Agreement (ii)
under a policy of insurance providing coverage or defense to any Seller, or
(iii) under the Charter Documents of Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries, (c)
arising from any actions, omissions or occurrences after the Closing, or (d)
under any of the agreements set forth on Schedule 8.14.

Section  8.15

Severance  Payment Obligations; Shareholder Approval of Payments; Non-Hire of
Certain  Employees

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

(a) Not later than ten (10) business days before the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall deliver to Holdco a schedule of those employees of Holdco and its
Subsidiaries proposed by the Buyer to be terminated as of the Closing (the
"Terminated Employees"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Severance
Payment Amount shall not include any severance amounts payable to any
employee of Holdco or its Subsidiaries who is not identified by the Buyer as
a Terminated Employee on the above-mentioned schedule. The Buyer shall, and
following the Closing shall cause Holdco and its Subsidiaries to, provide any
Severance Payments to which the Terminated Employees are entitled in
accordance with the terms of such Terminated Employee's Employment Agreement
or pursuant to any other employee benefit or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

severance plan maintained by Holdco or its Subsidiaries, in the amounts and
for the periods of time specified therein; provided, that in order to
receive any Severance Payment, each such Terminated Employee shall execute a
release, effective as of the Closing Date and substantially in the form of
Exhibit C attached hereto (the "Employee Release"). To the extent that any
Terminated Employee fails to execute and deliver the Employee Release at the
Closing, the amount of any Severance Payment that would otherwise have been
payable to such Terminated Employee at the Closing (and included in the
Severance Payment Amount) shall be paid instead into the Escrow Fund and
shall be released from the Escrow Fund to such Terminated Employee upon the
execution and delivery by such Terminated Employee of the Employee Release.
Any amounts paid into the Escrow Fund in respect of Severance Payments
pursuant to this Section 8.15(a) shall be released on the three-year
anniversary of the Closing, or such earlier time as the Buyer may agree, to
the Sellers' Representative.

 

 

 

(b) Prior to Closing, each of Holdco and its Subsidiaries shall seek
stockholder approval with respect to any excess parachute payments (as
defined under Code section 280G) payable to employees of Holdco and its
Subsidiaries as a result of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in
order to exempt such payments from the excise taxes under Code section 280G,
and reasonable evidence thereof shall have been delivered to the Buyer prior
to Closing; if stockholder approval is not obtained, no such payments shall
be made.

 

 

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 8.15, for a period of one year following
the Closing (or, if shorter, the number of months of severance to which a
person is entitled pursuant to the terms of his or her Employment Agreement
or other severance arrangement with Holdco and/or its Subsidiaries), the
Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, including Holdco and its
Subsidiaries, not to, hire or employ as an employee or consultant any
Terminated Employee.

 

 

        |  

Section  8.16

    |  

Maintenance  of Insurance

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

Holdco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain insurance
coverage for Holdco and its Subsidiaries through the Closing Date on terms no
less favorable than the insurance coverages for them in effect as of the
Effective Date.

 

 

        |  

Section  8.17

    |  

Financial  Statements

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, Holdco and its Subsidiaries
shall provide the Buyer with reasonable cooperation in the Buyer's
preparation of all financial statements for Holdco and its Subsidiaries
required to be included under the rules and regulations of the SEC by the
Buyer in its Form 8-K to be filed following the consummation of the
Transactions; provided, that Holdco and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to incur any out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith that are
not paid for by the Buyer.

The Buyer acknowledges that Holdco and its Subsidiaries are pursuing certain
claims against McNEIL-PPC, Inc. and/or its Affiliates under the McNeil
Agreement (including the agreements related to the transactions contemplated
thereby) to recover certain costs, expenses and other losses in connection
with the recall of the PediaCare Products as more fully described on Schedule
7.13(c) (the "PediaCare Recall Claims"). The Buyer further acknowledges that
Holdco and its Subsidiaries will continue to pursue the PediaCare Recall
Claims between the date hereof and the Closing, and may choose to settle such
claims, or otherwise resolve them, on such terms as determined in their
sole discretion. To the extent that any PediaCare Recall Claims are
not fully resolved prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (for such purpose, assuming that the Buyer and its
Affiliates (and not the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

Sellers) are entitled to any payments in respect thereof) to pursue in good
faith such claims after the Closing; provided, that the Buyer shall not
settle the PediaCare Recall Claims without the consent of the Sellers'
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). The Buyer shall pay to or as instructed by the Sellers'
Representative, for the account of the Sellers pro rata in accordance with
each Seller's Pro Rata Share, as an increase to the Purchase Price, any
proceeds received from and after the Closing from the settlement or other
resolution of the PediaCare Recall Claims within five (5) business days
of the receipt thereof; provided, that, to the extent that the Buyer incurs
any reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses in connection with pursuing the
PediaCare Recall Claims, the Buyer may offset the amount of such expenses
from the proceeds from the settlement or other resolution of the PediaCare
Recall Claims that would otherwise be paid to or as directed by the Sellers'
Representative under this Section 8.18.

reasonable efforts to maintain and renew (including, without limitation,
obtaining the assignments for applicable foreign trademarks purchased from
McNEIL-PPC, Inc.) any foreign trademarks identified by the Buyer which are
owned by Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries and are scheduled to expire or
otherwise lapse during such period; provided, that the Buyer shall be solely
responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by Holdco or any of its
Subsidiaries under this Section 8.20 and shall promptly reimburse Holdco
and/or its Subsidiaries for any such amounts upon receipt of documentation
thereof in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer or, at Holdco's option,
pay any such amounts directly.

employment by Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries or the termination thereof,
who has not executed and delivered the Employee Release as of the Closing,
until such time as such Terminated Employee executes and delivers the
Employee Release to Holdco.

 

 

(b) From and after the Closing and subject to the limitations contained in
this Article IX, the Buyer Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless
by each Seller for any Damages that the Buyer incurs by reason of the
following:

 

 

(i) the incorrectness, falsity or breach of the warranties and
representations made by such Seller in Article VI; provided, that

Section  9.4

    |  

Conditions  of Indemnification

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

No Party shall be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification pursuant
to Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 unless such claim is asserted by an
Indemnification Claim Notice given prior to the expiration of the
Indemnification Period. In the case of the Buyer Indemnitees, no claim
for indemnification may be asserted under Section 9.2 unless and only until
the aggregate amount of the Damages attributable to the Buyer Indemnitees
for indemnification under Section 9.2 exceeds the Deductible, in which case
the Buyer Indemnitees may claim for the amount of Damages in excess of
the Deductible; provided, however, that any claim for indemnification
relating to any Fundamental Representation shall not be subject to the
Deductible; and, provided, further, that no claim for indemnification shall
be required to be paid under Section 9.2(b)(iii) unless and only until the
Buyer Indemnitees have first pursued such claim against the Indemnification
Fund and there are no further assets therein. In the case of the Seller
Indemnitees, no claim for indemnification may be asserted under Section 9.3
unless and only until the aggregate amount of the Damages attributable to the
Seller Indemnitees for indemnification under Section 9.3 exceeds the
Deductible, in which case the Seller Indemnitees may claim for the amount of
Damages in excess of the Deductible; provided, however, that any claim for
indemnification relating to any Fundamental Representation shall not be
subject to the Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may not
make any claim for indemnification under Sections 9.2 or 9.3, as applicable,
for any claim that, individually, does not exceed the Indemnity Claim
Threshold; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any
claims for Damages arising from any breach of any Fundamental Representation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the maximum
aggregate liability of each Seller under Section 9.2(b) shall not exceed the
Cap of such Seller.

 

 

        |  

Section  9.5

    |  

Indemnification  Procedures

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

(a) Notice of Claim. Any Person making a claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3 above (an "Indemnified Party") must give the
party from whom indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party"), written
notice of such claim (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") (and, if the Buyer,
with a copy to the Escrow Agent and the Sellers' Representative stating the
aggregate amount of Damages claimed to have been incurred by the Buyer)
promptly after the Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim (a "Proceeding")
against or involving the Indemnified Party by a Governmental Authority or
other third Person (a "Third Party Claim") or otherwise discovers the
liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification
(it being understood that any claim for indemnity pursuant to Section 9.2 or
9.3 above must be made by written notice given within the applicable survival
period specified in Section 9.1 above). Such notice must contain a
description of the claim and the nature and amount of Damages (to the extent
that the nature and amount of Damages are known at such time). Such notice
shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with respect to
such Third Party Claim, including any summons, complaint or other pleading
which may have been served, any written demand or any other document or
instrument. Failure to give or delay in giving notice shall not excuse the
Indemnifying Party from liability for indemnification except to any extent to
which the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure or delay
or if the Indemnification Claim Notice is delivered after the time specified
in Section 9.1.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Response to Claim from Buyer Against Indemnification Fund.
Indemnification Claim Notices relating to a matter for which reimbursement
will be sought from the Indemnification Fund shall be governed by the
following additional terms and conditions: The Sellers' Representative shall
have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Indemnification Claim Notice to
dispute the claim or claims or to consent to the payment of such claim or
claims by delivering a notice to the Escrow Agent and the Buyer. In the event
the Sellers' Representative gives its consent to the payment of any such
claim, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article IX, pay to the Buyer the amount of Damages set forth in the
Indemnification Claim Notice. In the event the Sellers' Representative
disputes the payment of any claim, such claim shall become a disputed claim
("Disputed Claim") to be resolved in accordance with Section 9.5(c) as if the
claim were a Third Party Claim. If the Escrow Agent does not receive any
notice from the Sellers' Representative within the thirty-day period after
the receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by the Sellers'
Representative, the Escrow Agent shall confirm from the Sellers'
Representative that (i) the Sellers' Representative received the
Indemnification Claim Notice, and (ii) thirty (30) days have elapsed since
the receipt of the Indemnification Claim Notice by the Sellers'
Representative. Upon such confirmation by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent
shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX, pay to the
Buyer the amount of Damages set forth in the Indemnification Claim Notice.

 

 

(c) Control of Defense; Conditions. The obligations of an Indemnifying Party
under this Article IX with respect to Damages arising from any Third Party
Claims that are subject to the indemnification provided in Section 9.2 or 9.3
above shall be governed by the following additional terms and conditions:

 

 

(i) At its option, an Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume control
of the defense of any claim and may appoint as lead counsel of such defense
any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party (except that the Indemnifying Party may
not so elect without the Indemnified Party's consent unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party provides reasonable evidence to the Indemnified Party of
its financial ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations, and (ii)
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing that the
Indemnified Party will be indemnified against any Damages arising out of such
Third Party Claim (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.4).

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 9.5(c)(i) above, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of
its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such employment shall be
at the Indemnified Party's own expense unless (A) the employment thereof has
been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, (B) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ reasonably
satisfactory counsel (following written notice from the Indemnified Party),
in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party's
counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party, or (C) a conflict of
interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that
makes separate counsel advisable.

 

 

(iii) The Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to any Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned). The Indemnifying Party shall not consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned)
unless such judgment or settlement contains an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party and does not impose any obligations on it other than
monetary obligations that are being fully discharged simultaneously by the
Indemnifying Party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) The Sellers' Representative shall be authorized on behalf of the
Sellers, to the extent the Sellers are Indemnifying Parties, to provide the
notice contemplated by Section 9.5(a), to assume and control the defense, to
authorize settlements and to take other actions necessary or appropriate in
connection with Third Party Claims. Any indemnification from the
Indemnification Fund shall be deemed to have the Sellers as the Indemnifying
Parties.

 

 

(d) Manner of Payment.

 

 

(i) Any indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section
8.13 shall be paid solely out of the portion of the Indemnification Fund then
held in escrow and not previously distributed pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(ii) Any indemnification obligations of the Buyer pursuant to Section 9.3
shall be paid promptly by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an
account designated in writing by the applicable Seller Indemnitees, within
fifteen (15) days after the final determination thereof.

 

 

        |  

Section  9.6

    |  

Miscellaneous  Indemnification Provisions

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

(a) The amount of any claim for indemnification against the Indemnifying
Parties under this Agreement shall be net of (i) any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification by or
agreement with any third party ("Third Party Indemnity"), and (ii) any
insurance proceeds actually received as an offset against the amount of
Damages arising out of such claim or event for which indemnification is
sought hereunder. Prior to enforcing any claim for indemnification against
the Indemnifying Parties under this Agreement, the Indemnified Parties shall
administratively file in good faith claims with any insurers under applicable
policies of insurance, if any, for the proceeds of such insurance coverage,
if any, applicable to the claim or event from which such indemnification
right arose. In the event that any Third Party Indemnity or insurance
proceeds are paid to the Indemnified Parties respecting an event to which an
indemnification right applies hereunder, such indemnification right shall
apply only to the extent that the amount of Damages indemnified against
exceeds the amount of such Third Party Indemnity or insurance proceeds, as
applicable, actually paid to the Indemnified Parties, net of the costs and
expenses of the Indemnified Parties in obtaining such Third Party Indemnity
or insurance proceeds, as applicable. If any Third Party Indemnity or
insurance proceeds are actually realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent
to the receipt by such Indemnified Party of an indemnification payment
hereunder in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds relate,
appropriate refunds shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying
Party regarding the amount of such indemnification payment. In addition, the
amount of any Damages and the amount of any Tax Losses under Section
8.13(c) shall be reduced by the amount of any Tax Benefit realized by the
Buyer, any Affiliate of the Buyer, Holdco or any Subsidiary of Holdco in any
taxable period after the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 9.6(a),
"Tax Benefit" shall mean the Assumed Tax Rate multiplied by any deduction,
exclusion from income or other Tax allowance which would not, but for the
event giving rise to indemnification under Section 9.2 or Section 8.13(c),
be allowable. If any Tax Benefit is in the form of a credit against
Tax, solely for purposes of this Section 9.6(a), the Assumed Tax Rate shall
be deemed to equal one.

 

 

(b) The Indemnified Parties agree that: (i) the Indemnified Party shall act
reasonably and in good faith in an effort to mitigate any Damages to which it
is entitled to indemnification; and (ii) the Indemnifying Parties shall be
entitled to reasonably participate, at their sole cost and expense, but not
control in such mitigation by the Indemnified Party.

 

 

(c) In no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to recover or make a
claim for any amounts in respect of consequential, incidental, indirect
damages, lost profits, or punitive damages of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

such Indemnified Party, in particular, no "multiple profits" or "multiple of
cash flow" or similar methodology shall be used in the calculation of any
Damages of such Indemnified Party.

 

 

 

(d) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any claim for indemnification
under this Article IX for any Damages arising out of changes after the
Closing Date in any Legal Requirement or changes in GAAP.

 

 

(e) Indemnification payments from the Sellers to a Buyer Indemnitee shall be
deemed a reduction in the Final Purchase Price.

Section  9.7

    |  

Certain  Other Indemnity Matters

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

From and after the Closing, the Parties sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, other than claims of fraud or claims for equitable injunctive
relief with respect to any violation of the covenants in this Agreement,
shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in this Article IX and Section
8.13.

 

 

        |  

Section  9.8

    |  

Jurisdiction  and Venue

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

Each Indemnifying Party (i) consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
state or federal court sitting in the State of New York for purposes of the
assertion by such Indemnified Party of any claim such Indemnified Party may
have against such Indemnifying Party with respect to such third party claim
or the matters alleged therein, and (ii) agrees that process may be served on
such Indemnifying Party with respect to such a claim by the Indemnified Party
anywhere in the world, provided that such process shall not be valid unless
and until a copy of it is provided to the Indemnifying Party to be served
with such process as if such process were a notice being given to such
Indemnifying Party under Section 12.5.

conditions precedent:

 

 

(a) Representations and Warranties; Covenants. (i) Each representation and

material respects at and as of the Closing as though then made except to the
extent such representations and warranties by their terms speak as of an

respects as of such earlier date (except for any representations or
warranties that are qualified by the concept of materiality, which shall be
true and correct in all respects), and (ii) the Buyer shall have performed
and observed in all material respects each covenant or other obligation
required to be performed or observed by it at or prior to Closing pursuant to
the Transaction Documents prior to the Closing; except for breaches of such

Frustration  of Closing Conditions

Neither the Sellers nor the Buyer may rely on the failure of any condition
set forth in this Article X to be satisfied if such failure was caused by
such Party's failure to act in good faith or to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur, as required by Section 8.1.

Specific  Performance

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by them in accordance
with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached and that each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the provisions of
this Agreement (without any requirement to post any bond or other security in
connection with seeking such relief), in addition to any other remedy at Law
or equity, exclusively in any state or federal court within the State of New
York. The parties hereto agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches of this Agreement by Holdco or the Sellers, on the one
hand, and to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by the Buyer, on
the other hand, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any
such action or proceeding relating to this Section 10.4, for itself and in
respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Section 10.4 in any court other than the aforesaid
courts. For purposes of this Section 10.4, each of the parties hereto hereby
consents to service of process in accordance with the terms of Section 9.8 of
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Closing shall not have
occurred because of a breach by the Buyer of any material covenant under this
Agreement (including as a result of a breach of its representation set forth
in Section 5.4) and all of the conditions set forth in Section 10.1 to the
Buyer's obligations have either been satisfied or previously waived (or would
have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied but for such breach of
the Buyer's obligations under this Agreement), then either the Sellers'
Representative or Holdco shall have the right to a court order specifically
enforcing the provisions of this Agreement to which such breach applies and,
in any event, to specifically force the Closing to occur.

This Agreement may be terminated as provided below:

 

 

(a) The Parties may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent of the
Sellers' Representative and the Buyer at any time prior to the Closing;

 

 

(b) The Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the
Sellers' Representative at any time prior to the Closing (i) if the Buyer is

contained in this Agreement (including the representation set forth in

representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, the Buyer
has notified the Sellers' Representative of the breach, and, if of a type
which can be cured, the breach has continued without cure for a period of
thirty (30) days after the notice of breach, and further, such breach is such
that the conditions set forth in Section 10.1(a) are incapable of being
satisfied as a result thereof, or (ii) if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before December 31, 2010, as such date shall be extended for up to
three (3) months in the event the conditions set forth in Section 10.1(e) and
Section 10.2(d) has not been satisfied ("Termination Date"), by reason of the
failure of any condition precedent under Section 10.1 (unless the failure
results primarily from the Buyer breaching any material covenant contained in
this Agreement (including as a result of a breach of the representation set
forth in Section 5.4)).

(c) The Sellers' Representative may terminate this Agreement by giving
written notice to the Buyer at any time prior to the Closing (i) if the
Sellers or Holdco are not then in breach of any material representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, in the event the Buyer has
breached any material representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement, the Sellers' Representative has notified the Buyer of the breach,
and, if of a type which can be cured, the breach has continued without cure
for a period of thirty (30) days after the notice of breach, and further,
such breach is such that the conditions set forth in Section 10.2(a) are
incapable of being satisfied as a result thereof or (ii) if the Closing shall
not have occurred on or before the Termination Date, by reason of the failure
of any condition precedent under Section 10.2 (unless the failure results
primarily from Holdco or the Sellers breaching any material covenant
contained in this Agreement).

Section  11.2

    |  

Effect  of Termination

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article XI, (i) in the event
the Sellers' Representative terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.1(c)(ii) rather than pursuing or continuing to pursue its right to
specific performance pursuant to Section 10.4 or if it is not awarded such
specific performance at a time when (A) all of the conditions precedent set
forth in Section 10.1 of this Agreement have been satisfied or previously
waived (or would have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied but
for such breach of the Buyer's obligations under this Agreement), and (B) the
Buyer had no right to terminate this Agreement at such time, then the Buyer
shall pay to the Target the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of
such termination, and the Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy in the event of
such termination shall be the receipt by the Target of the Termination Fee
from the Buyer.

 

 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 11.2, if either Party
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void and all rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate without any liability, except for the agreements
set forth in Section 8.4, this Section 11.2 and Article XII; provided, that
no such termination shall relieve any party liability for any breach of any
covenant set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination (provided that
an action by the non-breaching party must be commenced with respect to such
breach no later than the first anniversary of such termination).

 

 

(c) All costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) incurred by a non-breaching Party in connection with enforcing its
rights hereunder with respect to a breach of any covenant hereunder by
another Party prior to the Closing shall be paid by the breaching Party.

Section  12.1

    |  

Treatment  of Confidential Information

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

(a) The Sellers and Holdco acknowledge that they have had in the past,
currently have and in the future may have access to Confidential Information
with respect to the Business of Holdco and its Subsidiaries. The Sellers,
from and after the Closing until the third anniversary of the Closing Date,
agree that they will keep confidential all such Confidential Information
furnished to them and, except with the specific prior written consent of the
Buyer, will not use any such Confidential Information and will not disclose
any such Confidential Information to any Person except (i) Representatives of
the Buyer and its Affiliates and (ii) their own Representatives, provided
that these Representatives agree to the confidentiality provisions of this
Section 12.1; provided, however, that, for purposes of this Section 12.1(a),
Confidential Information does not include such information as (i) becomes
known to the public generally through no fault of the Sellers or their
Representatives or (ii) is required to be disclosed by law or the order of
any Governmental Authority under color of law or in order to enforce their
obligations

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

hereunder, provided, that prior to the disclosure by the Sellers of any
information under this clause (ii), the Sellers will give prior written
notice to the Buyer of the circumstances requiring disclosure and provide the
Buyer with the opportunity to contest that disclosure. Notwithstanding the
above, in the event that this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, the
Sellers shall have no obligation to the Buyer with respect to Confidential
Information except with respect to Confidential Information relating to the
Buyer and its Affiliates.

 

 

 

(b) Because of (i) the difficulty of measuring economic losses as a result of
the breach of the foregoing covenants in Section 12.1(a) and (ii) the
immediate and irreparable damage that would be caused to the Buyer for which
it would have no other adequate remedy, the Sellers agree that, in the event
of a breach or threatened breach by the Sellers of the provisions of this
Section 12.1 with respect to any Confidential Information, the Buyer and its
successors and assigns shall be entitled to seek an injunction restraining
the Sellers from disclosing, in whole or in part, that Confidential
Information (without the necessity of posting any bond or proving any actual
damages, all of which are waived by the Sellers). Nothing herein shall be
construed as prohibiting the Buyer from pursuing any other available remedy
for that breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages.

Section  12.2

    |  

Assignment;  No Third Party Beneficiaries

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

This Agreement and the rights of the Parties hereunder may not be assigned
without the prior written consent of (i) the Buyer, in the case of any
attempted assignment by Holdco or the Sellers, or (ii) the Sellers'
Representative, in the case of any attempted assignment by the Buyer and will
be binding on and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this Section 12.2 shall be void; provided that, the Buyer may
make the following assignments in its sole discretion: (x) the Buyer may (at
any time prior to the Closing) assign, in whole or in part, its rights and
obligations pursuant to this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates
(including Affiliates which may be organized subsequent to the Effective
Date) so long as such assignment would not delay or prevent the Closing; (y)
the Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement for collateral security
purposes to any lenders providing financing to the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates; and (z) the Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement, in
whole or in part, to any subsequent purchaser of the Purchased Shares or the
assets of Holdco and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that no
such assignment in (x), (y) or (z) above shall release the Buyer of any of
its obligations hereunder. Neither this Agreement nor any other Transaction
Document is intended, or shall be construed, deemed or interpreted, to confer
on any Person not a party hereto (or a permitted assignee thereof) or thereto
any rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder, except as Article IX
or Section 8.13 provides or as otherwise provided expressly herein.

This Agreement, which includes the Exhibits and the Schedules hereto, and
the documents delivered hereunder, together with that certain
Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 11, 2010, between the Buyer and Holdco,
constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, including the Letter of
Intent. This Agreement may be amended, and any right hereunder may be waived,
if, but only if, that amendment or waiver is in writing and signed by the
Buyer and the Sellers' Representative, except for any amendment that treats
any Seller differently from any other Seller in any material adverse respect,
in which case the consent of any such adversely affected Seller shall also
be required. The waiver of any of the terms and conditions hereof shall not
be construed or interpreted as, or deemed to be, a waiver of any other
term or condition hereof.

Except as this Agreement otherwise provides, no delay or omission in the
exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to any Party hereto as a
result of any breach or default hereunder by any other Party hereto will
impair any such right, power or remedy, nor will it be construed, deemed or
interpreted as a waiver of or acquiescence in any such breach or default, or
of any similar breach or default occurring later; nor will any waiver of any
single breach or default be construed, deemed or interpreted as a waiver of

Conflicts  and Privilege

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Sellers' Representative
has retained Covington and Burling LLP ("Covington") to act as its counsel in
connection with the Transactions. The Buyer hereby agrees that, in the event
that a dispute arises after the Closing between the Buyer, Holdco and its
Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Sellers' Representative and the Sellers
on the other hand, Covington may represent the Sellers' Representative and
the Sellers in such dispute even though the interests of the Sellers'
Representative and the Sellers may be directly adverse to Holdco and its
Subsidiaries, and even though Covington may have represented Holdco or its
Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for Holdco or its Subsidiaries. The Buyer further
agrees that, as to all communications among Covington, Holdco,
its Subsidiaries, the Sellers' Representative and/or any Seller that relate
in any way to the Transactions, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to the Sellers' Representative and
the Sellers and may be controlled by the Sellers' Representative and the
Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer, Holdco or any of
its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Buyer, Holdco and its Subsidiaries on the one hand and a
third party other than the Sellers' Representative or a Seller on the other
hand, the Buyer, Holdco and its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third
party; provided, however, that neither the Buyer, Holdco or its Subsidiaries
may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Sellers'
Representative.

member, partner, agent, attorney, Representative or Affiliate of any Party
(including any Person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a
Party) (any such Person, a "Non-Obligated Person") has any liability or
obligation with respect to this Agreement or with respect to any claim or
cause of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement (including the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement and any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement).

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that
provision will, to the extent possible, be modified in such manner as to be
valid, legal and enforceable but so as to most nearly retain the intent of
the Parties hereto as expressed herein, and if such a modification is not
possible, that provision will be severed from this Agreement, and in either
case the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

it one or more separate signature pages, which together contain the

Payments  to the Sellers' Representative

The Buyer will have no liability or obligation for the amount paid or to be
paid by the Sellers' Representative to each Seller and the Buyer's sole
obligation under this Agreement shall be to pay to or as instructed by the
Sellers' Representative payments to be paid by it to the Sellers'
Representative in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Seller
expressly authorizes the Buyer and the Escrow Agent to make all payments to
which such Seller is entitled under this Agreement to the Sellers'
Representative and agrees and confirms that payment thereof by the Buyer
shall constitute payment by the Buyer to such Seller. The Sellers'
Representative shall cause all amounts of the Final Purchase Price received
from the Buyer to be distributed to the Sellers in accordance with each
Seller's Pro Rata Share.

Indemnification  of Sellers' Representative

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

The Sellers' Representative shall be indemnified for and shall be held
harmless by the Sellers against any loss, liability or expense incurred by
the Sellers' Representative or any of its Affiliates and any of their
respective partners, managers, members, directors, officers, employees,
agents, stockholders, consultants, attorneys, accountants, advisors, brokers,
representatives or controlling persons, in each case relating to the Sellers'
Representative's conduct as the Sellers' Representative, other than losses,

indemnification (including the costs and expenses of enforcing this right of
indemnification) shall be first deducted from the Sellers' Expense Amount and

Introduction

 

 

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), dated
as of [ ], 2010, by and among the Buyer, Blacksmith Brands Holdings, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Holdco"), and the stockholders of Holdco as set forth
on Exhibit A attached thereto (the "Holdco Stockholders"), the Holdco
Stockholders have agreed to sell, and the Buyer has agreed to purchase, 100%
of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of Holdco, on the
terms and conditions set forth therein. Capitalized terms used in this
Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings
given to them in the Purchase Agreement.

 

 

The parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, for good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, hereby agree as follows:

 

 

1.  Appointment of Escrow Agent; Establishment of Escrow.1

 

 

(a) On the Closing Date, the Buyer has deposited, or caused to be deposited,
with the Escrow Agent (in an account designated by the Escrow Agent) an
aggregate amount of $8,700,000 (the "Escrow Amount"), which consists of a
$1,200,000 portion (the "Working Capital Deficiency Adjustment Fund") and a
$7,500,000 portion (the "Indemnification Fund"), and the Escrow Agent
acknowledges receipt of the Escrow Amount. The Escrow Amount plus any
Escrow Consideration (as defined below) allocable to it minus any
amounts released or disbursed therefrom from time to time in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be referred to herein as the "Escrow Fund."

 

 

(b) The Buyer and the Sellers' Representative hereby jointly appoint the
Escrow Agent as the escrow agent under this Agreement and the Escrow Agent
hereby agrees to act as escrow agent and to hold, safeguard, and disburse the
Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof.

 

 

2.  Investment of Funds.

 

 

(a) Except as the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative may from time to time
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing, the Escrow Fund shall be
invested from time to time in a [money market fund] listed on Exhibit A
attached hereto. Such joint written instructions referred to in the
foregoing sentence shall specify the type and identity of the investments to
be purchased and/or sold and shall also include the name of the broker-
dealer, if any, which the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative direct the
Escrow Agent to use in respect of such investment, any particular settlement
procedures required (which settlement procedures shall be consistent with
industry standards and practices), and such other information as the Escrow
Agent may reasonably require. The Escrow Agent shall liquidate any
investments held in order to provide funds necessary to make required
payments under this Agreement.

   

 

1 Section 1 and Section 3(c) to be revised in the event that any amounts are
paid into the Escrow Account in respect of Severance Payments pursuant to
Section 8.15(a) of the Purchase Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-1    

 

 

 

The income of any investments made pursuant to this Section  2(a) shall
collectively be referred to herein as the "Escrow Consideration."

 

 

 

(b) The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent as an escrow fund and
shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other
judicial process of any creditor of any party thereto.

 

 

3.  Distribution of Funds; Indemnity Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be released from the account in which such fund is held as follows:

 

 

(a) Purchase Price Adjustment. Promptly after the Final Determination Date
(as defined below), if a payment is to be made to the Buyer in accordance
with Section 3.1(e) of the Purchase Agreement, then the Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to
pay to the Buyer, from the Escrow Fund, the amount payable to the Buyer
pursuant to Section 3.1(e) of the Purchase Agreement, and the Escrow
Agent shall promptly (and in any event within five business days following
the Escrow Agent's receipt of such joint written instruction) pay such amount
to the Buyer or the Buyer's designee. If the amount paid to the Buyer or
the Buyer's designee pursuant to the preceding sentence (which shall equal
zero if no amount is paid to the Buyer or the Buyer's designee) is less than
the amount of the Working Capital Deficiency Adjustment Fund, then the Buyer
and the Sellers' Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent in
writing to pay to or as instructed by the Sellers' Representative, from the
Escrow Fund, an amount equal to the difference thereof, and the Escrow Agent
shall promptly (and in any event within five business days following the
Escrow Agent's receipt of such joint written instruction) pay such amount to
or as instructed by the Sellers' Representative. For purposes of this Section
 3(a), the term "Final Determination Date" means the earliest to occur of:
(A) the thirty-first (31st) day following the receipt of the Proposed Closing
Statement by the Sellers' Representative if a Notice of Disagreement has not
been delivered to the Buyer by the Sellers' Representative, (B) the date that
a written resolution is executed pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(v) or Section
3.1(d)(vi) of the Purchase Agreement, if all outstanding matters are resolved
through such resolution, and (C) the date that the Accounting Firm delivers
its final, binding resolution pursuant to Section 3.1(d)(vi) of the Purchase
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to establish the Final
Determination Date or to determine whether any Notice of Disagreement has
been delivered, but shall rely conclusively and without further inquiry on
joint written instructions furnished by the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative with respect to distributions pursuant to this Section  3(a).

 

 

(b) Indemnification Fund.

 

 

(i) Any Buyer Indemnitee making a claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2(a) or Section 8.13(c) of the Purchase Agreement must give the
Sellers' Representative written notice of such claim (an "Indemnification
Claim Notice"), with a copy to the Escrow Agent, stating the aggregate
amount the Buyer Indemnitee claims to be entitled to be paid from the Escrow
Fund, promptly after the Buyer Indemnitee receives any written notice of any
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against or
involving the Buyer Indemnitee by a Governmental Authority or other third
person (a "Third Party Claim") or otherwise discovers the liability,
obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification. Such
notice shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with
respect to such claim for indemnification, including any summons, complaint
or other pleading which may have been served, any written demand or any other
document or instrument. Failure to give or delay in giving notice shall not
excuse the party from whom indemnification is sought from liability for

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

indemnification except to any extent to which the Buyer Indemnitee is
actually prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 

 

(ii) The Sellers' Representative shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt
of the Indemnification Claim Notice to dispute the claim or claims, the
amount requested to be paid from the Escrow Fund or any other matter set
forth in the Indemnification Claim Notice or other documents delivered by the
Buyer hereunder or to consent to the payment of such claim or claims by
delivering a notice to the Escrow Agent and the Buyer. In the event the
Sellers' Representative gives its consent to the payment of any such claim,
the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Buyer the amount requested to be paid in
the Indemnification Claim Notice. If the Escrow Agent does not receive any
notice from the Sellers' Representative within the thirty-day period
after the receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice by the Sellers'
Representative, the Escrow Agent shall seek to obtain written confirmation
from the Sellers' Representative that (i) the Sellers' Representative
received the Indemnification Claim Notice, and (ii) thirty (30) days have
elapsed since the receipt of the Indemnification Claim Notice by the Sellers'
Representative. Upon (A) receipt of such written confirmation by the Escrow
Agent, or (B) the Sellers' Representative having failed to respond to the
Escrow Agent's request for such written confirmation for a period of five (5)
business days, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Buyer the amount requested
to be paid in the Indemnification Claim Notice, from the Escrow Fund, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in the
Indemnification Claim Notice or otherwise by the Buyer.

 

 

(iii) Subject to Section  3(b)(ii), if it is determined, in accordance with
the terms of the Purchase Agreement, that a Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to
any payment from the Escrow Fund in respect of an Indemnification Claim
Notice, then, in each such case, the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative
shall promptly deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written notice specifying
the portion of the Escrow Fund that is equal to the amount to which the
Buyer Indemnitee is entitled and the Escrow Agent shall promptly pay to the
applicable Buyer Indemnitee, from the Escrow Fund, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in such joint written
notice, the amount requested to be paid in such joint written notice.

 

 

(c) Payment Upon Expiration of the Survival Period. If any portion of the
Escrow Fund remains upon the expiration of the Indemnification Period, then
the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall promptly (and in any event
within one business day after the expiration of the Indemnification Period)
deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written notice specifying the amount (the
"Payment Amount") equal to the excess of (A) the then-remaining Escrow Fund
over (B) the aggregate amount of all claims for indemnification of Buyer
Indemnitees which were properly asserted and pending as of the expiration of
the Indemnification Period, and the Escrow Agent shall promptly (and in any
event within one business day following the Escrow Agent's receipt of such
joint written notice) pay to the Sellers' Representative, from the Escrow
Fund, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Sellers' Representative, the Payment Amount, together with
any Escrow Consideration.

 

 

(d) Treatment of Remaining Funds. In the event that any amount (the
"Remaining Amount") remains in the Escrow Fund after Section   3(c) has been
complied with, then, promptly upon (and in any event within one business day
after) the resolution of any claim of indemnification that was pending as of
the expiration of the Indemnification Period, the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written notice
specifying (A) the portion, if any, of the Remaining Amount to be released to
any Buyer Indemnitee, (B) the portion, if any, of the Remaining Amount to be

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-3  

 

 

 

released to or as directed by the Sellers' Representative, and (C) the
portion of the Remaining Amount, if any, to be retained in the Escrow Fund,
and the Escrow Agent shall promptly (and in any event within one business day
following the Escrow Agent's receipt of such joint written notice) pay to the
applicable party, from the Escrow Fund, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to one or more accounts designated in such joint written
notice, amounts equal to the respective portion of the Remaining Amount, if
any, to which such party is entitled in accordance with the joint written
notice.

 

 

 

(e) Releases to Sellers' Representative. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, whenever this Agreement contemplates a payment to
the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers' Representative shall have the right
to instruct the Escrow Agent in writing that, in lieu of making such payment
to the Sellers' Representative, the Escrow Agent make direct payments to the
Sellers, in each case subject to the Sellers' Representative providing the
Escrow Agent with (i) a list setting forth the respective amounts to be paid
to each such Seller, (ii) the respective wire transfer information and (iii)
completed, original Form W-9s for each such Seller. The Sellers'
Representative shall be entitled to retain any payment, or portion thereof,
made to the Sellers' Representative in the event that the Sellers' Expense
Amount is insufficient to cover the fees or expenses incurred by the Sellers'
Representative in performing its duties under this Agreement or the Purchase
Agreement.

 

 

(f) Maximum Amount of Escrow Payments to Buyer Indemnitees. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the aggregate
amount of any payments to the Buyer or any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to
Section   3(a) and Section  3(b) exceed the Escrow Fund plus any
Escrow Consideration.

 

 

4. Termination of Escrow and Final Release of Escrow Fund. This Agreement shall terminate upon the final distribution of all of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that any fees, expenses, costs or other amounts required to be paid to the Escrow Agent hereunder are not fully and finally paid prior to termination, the provisions of Section  5(h) hereof shall survive the termination of this Agreement until such time as all fees, expenses, costs and other amounts have been paid in full.

 

 

5. Duties of Escrow Agent.

 

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 2, the Escrow Agent shall not be required
to invest any funds held hereunder except as directed in this Agreement.
Uninvested funds held hereunder shall not earn or accrue interest. The
Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties or obligations and shall be
required to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth in
this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to take notice of the
Purchase Agreement and shall have no duty or responsibility to take
any action pursuant to the terms thereof. The Escrow Agent shall not
be obligated to take any legal action or to commence any proceedings in
connection with the Escrow Fund or this Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute
or defend in any such legal action or proceedings.

 

 

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable, except for its own gross
negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct and, except with respect to
claims based upon such gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct
that are asserted against the Escrow Agent, the other parties hereto shall
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent (and any
successor to the Escrow Agent) and each of the Escrow Agent's officers,
directors, agents and employees from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses, including reasonable
legal

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-4  

 

 

 

fees and disbursements of one outside counsel (but not with respect to costs
and expenses allocated to its internal counsel), directly or indirectly
arising out of and in connection with this Agreement or the undertaking of
the Escrow Agent to serve as the Escrow Agent hereunder. The right to the
indemnity afforded hereby shall survive the termination of this Agreement and
any resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Escrow Agent shall in no event be liable in connection with
its investment or reinvestment of any of the Escrow Fund held by it hereunder
in good faith in accordance with the terms hereof, including, without
limitation, any liability for any delays (not resulting from its gross
negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct) in the investment or
reinvestment of the Escrow Fund, or any loss of interest incident to any such
delays. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or
consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever, including, but not
limited to, lost profits, even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

 

 

 

(c) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment,
certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to it
hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity or the
correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of the
service thereof, unless the Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of any such
lack of authenticity, correctness, propriety or validity. The Escrow Agent
may act in reliance upon any instrument or signature reasonably believed by
it to be genuine and may assume that the person purporting to make any
statement or execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof
has been duly authorized to do so unless the Escrow Agent has actual
knowledge of the lack of authority. The Escrow Agent may conclusively presume
that the undersigned representative of any party hereto which is an entity
has full power and authority to instruct the Escrow Agent on behalf of that
party unless written notice to the contrary is delivered to the Escrow Agent
or unless the Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of the lack of power or
authority.

 

 

(d) The Escrow Agent may act pursuant to the advice of legal counsel with
respect to any matter relating to this Agreement and shall not be liable for
any action taken or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such
advice. The Escrow Agent shall not have any interest in the Escrow Fund
deposited hereunder and is serving as escrow holder only and having only
possession thereof. The Escrow Agent shall prepare and provide to the
Sellers' Representative and the Buyer a monthly information statement of the
Escrow Consideration no later than the last calendar day of any given month
in respect of the immediately preceding full calendar month (the "Monthly
Earnings Statement"). This Section  5(d), Section  5(b) and Section  5(h)
shall survive notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement or the
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

 

 

(e) The Escrow Agent makes no representation as to the validity, value,
genuineness or the collectability of any security or other document or
instrument held by or delivered to it.

 

 

(f) The Escrow Agent (and any successor to the Escrow Agent) may resign at
any time upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Sellers'
Representative and the Buyer, and may be removed by the mutual consent of the
Sellers' Representative and the Buyer upon thirty (30) days' prior written
notice to the Escrow Agent. Prior to the effective date of the resignation or
removal of the Escrow Agent, the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer shall
jointly appoint a successor escrow agent, to hold the Escrow Fund, and any
such successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver to the predecessor
escrow agent an instrument accepting such appointment, upon which such
successor agent shall, without further act, become vested with all of the
rights, powers and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

originally named herein. If no successor escrow agent is appointed prior to
the effective date of the termination or resignation of the Escrow Agent, the
Escrow Agent shall first, place all of the Escrow Fund at the disposal of a
court and petition the court to act as the successor escrow agent or to
appoint another entity to act as the successor escrow agent and second, if
the court does not agree to act as successor agent or fails to appoint
another entity to act as a successor escrow agent, deposit all of the Escrow
Fund into the registry of any court of competent jurisdiction and notify the
Sellers' Representative and the Buyer in writing of such deposit. In the
event that the Escrow Agent makes a deposit of the Escrow Fund into the
registry of a court in the manner specified in the preceding sentence, the
Escrow Agent shall thereupon be discharged from all further duties as the
escrow agent hereunder.

 

 

(g) In the event of any disagreement between the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative resulting in conflicting claims or demands being made in
connection with the Escrow Fund or in the event that the Escrow Agent is in
reasonable doubt as to what action it should take hereunder, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to retain the Escrow Fund until the Escrow Agent shall have
received (i) a final and non-appealable judgment resolving the applicable
claim or directing delivery of the Escrow Fund or (ii) joint written
instructions executed by the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative directing
delivery of the Escrow Fund, in which event the Escrow Agent shall disburse
the Escrow Fund in accordance with such final and non-appealable judgment,
decision, award or written instructions. The Escrow Agent shall act on such
final and non-appealable judgment, decision, award or written instructions
without further questions.

 

 

(h) The Escrow Agent shall be paid compensation (as payment in full) for the
services to be rendered by the Escrow Agent hereunder in accordance with the
terms of Exhibit B attached hereto, the terms of which are incorporated
herein by reference, and shall be reimbursed promptly upon receipt of a
written invoice from the Escrow Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Escrow Agent in
performance of its duties hereunder (including reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of one outside counsel, but not any fees or expenses allocated
to its internal counsel). Any such compensation and reimbursement to which
the Escrow Agent is entitled shall be paid by the Buyer; provided,
that, solely as between the Sellers' Representative and the Buyer, the
Sellers' Representative will reimburse the Buyer, within ten (10) business
days after payment, for fifty percent (50%) of such payments.

 

 

(i) In connection with any funds transfer, the Escrow Agent may rely solely
upon any account numbers or similar identifying number provided in accordance
herewith to identify (A) the beneficiary, (B) the beneficiary's bank, or (C)
an order executed by such party using any such identifying number, even where
its use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the
transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary's bank, or an
intermediary bank designated. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability with
respect to the transfer or distribution of any funds effected by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to wiring or transfer instructions provided to the Escrow
Agent by any party to this Agreement.

 

 

6. Responsibility. The Sellers' Representative represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that it is duly appointed to act as the Sellers' Representative, in the manner contemplated by the terms of this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) with respect to all matters arising under this Agreement, including the receipt of notices and the exercise of any rights with respect to the Escrow Agent's obligations under this Agreement, the modification or amendment of the terms of such agreements, the waiver of conditions, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-6  

 

 

 

and resolution of disputes or uncertainties arising thereunder, the execution
and delivery of documents, the payment of amounts due and the delivery and
receipt of notice regarding indemnification matters. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying upon,
the power and authority of the Sellers' Representative without
independent investigation. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability to any
Seller or any other constituencies for any acts or omissions of the
Sellers' Representative, or any acts or omissions taken or not taken at the
direction of the Sellers' Representative.

 

 

 

7. Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) The Sellers' Representative and the Buyer agree to treat the Escrow
Fund consistently with the provisions of Proposed Treasury Regulation
§1.468B-8, and to file all Tax Returns on a basis consistent with
such treatment. This Section 7(a) shall survive notwithstanding
any termination of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) For all Tax purposes, all payments from the Escrow Fund to the Sellers'
Representative shall be treated by the parties as adjustments to the Final
Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Law, including, without
limitation, Section 483 of the Code. This Section 7(b) shall survive
notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement.

 

 

(c) On or before the execution of this Agreement, the Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative shall each provide to the Escrow Agent a completed
Form W‑9. Promptly following the end of each calendar year, the Sellers'
Representative shall furnish to the Escrow Agent written instructions setting
forth the amounts and recipients of earnings and other amounts which should
properly be reported on Form 1099s. Except with respect to Form 1099s, the
Escrow Agent shall have no authority or responsibility to prepare or file any
state or federal tax return or report with respect to the Escrow Fund or any
earnings thereon. This Section 7(c) shall survive notwithstanding
any termination of this Agreement.

 

 

8. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally, faxed (which is confirmed) or sent by commercial overnight courier to the parties at the following addresses (or to such other address as the person to whom notice is given may have previously furnished to the others in writing in the manner set forth above; provided that notice of any change of address shall be effective only upon receipt thereof):

9.  Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily applicable by statute and
would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

 

 

(b) Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of (x) the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and (y) the United
States District Court for the Southern District Court of New York, for the
purposes of any claim, action or proceeding ("Proceedings") arising out of
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to
commence

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-8  

 

 

 

any such Proceeding either in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York or, if such Proceeding may not be brought in
such court for jurisdictional reasons, in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, New York County. Each party further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such party's
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for
any Proceeding in New York with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction in this Section 9(b). Each party irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in (i) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or
(ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
plea or claim in any such court that any such Proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding anything in
this Section 9(b) to the contrary, in the event it is finally judicially
determined by (x) the Supreme Court of the State of New York or (y) the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York that a
Proceeding may not be maintained in either of such jurisdictions, then the
parties may bring such Proceeding in an alternate jurisdiction.

 

 

 

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT TO ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9(C).

 

 

10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of a signed counterpart by facsimile or other electronic transmission will constitute a party's due execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 

 

11. Section Headings. The headings of sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or interpretation.

 

 

12. Waiver. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (A) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby can be discharged by any party hereto, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other parties hereto; (B) no waiver that may be given by a party hereto will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (C) no notice to or demand on any party hereto will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party hereto giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

13. Entire Agreement and Modification. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements (written or oral) between the parties hereto with respect to its subject matter and constitutes (along with the documents referred to in this Agreement, as to parties other than the Escrow Agent) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by each party hereto.

 

 

14. Severability and Further Assurances. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, then to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall, at the request of any other party hereto, deliver to the requesting party all further documents or other assurances as may reasonably be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 

 

15. Specific Enforcement. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at Law or equity.

 

 

16. Benefits; Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; provided, however, that any person into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated or any person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which it shall be a party or any person to which the Escrow Agent may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its escrow/custody business, provided such person shall be eligible to serve as escrow agent hereunder, shall be the successor hereunder to the Escrow Agent without the execution or filing of any document or agreement or any further act; and provided, further, that the Buyer may assign all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its respective affiliates without the prior written consent of any other party hereto (but only if the Buyer agrees in writing to remain primarily liable hereunder for any obligations so assigned), and that such affiliate of the Buyer shall promptly notify the other parties hereto in writing of any such assignment. Any attempted assignment in violation of the immediately preceding sentence shall be void.

 

 

17. Amendment; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by of each of the parties hereto. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person (other than the parties hereto) any rights or remedies.

 

 

18. Interpretation. Solely as among the parties hereto other than the Escrow Agent, the Purchase Agreement, as it may from time to time be amended, shall control in the event of any inconsistency with this Agreement.

 

 

19. Business Day. As used in this Agreement, the term "business day" means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or other day on which commercial banks in New York City, New York are authorized or required by law to close. If any day specified in this Agreement for the taking of 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B-10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

action by the Escrow Agent shall not be a business day, then such action
shall be taken on the next succeeding day that is a business day.

 

 

20. Representations and Warranties. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the Escrow Agent, the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative hereby represents and warrants to each of the other parties hereto (A) that this Agreement has been duly authorized and executed and delivered on its behalf, constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation and is enforceable in accordance with its terms except insofar as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy insolvency, reorganization, liquidation or similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies and (B) that the execution and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by such person do not and will not result in a material breach of or constitute a material default under or a material violation of any trust (constructive or other), agreement, judgment, decree, order or other instrument to which it is a party or it or its properties or assets may be bound.
