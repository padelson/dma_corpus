  THIS  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " **Agreement** "),
dated as of May 6,  2008, is by and among BEandK, Inc., a Delaware
corporation  (" **BE andK**"), KBR, Inc., a Delaware corporation  (" **KBR**
"), and Whitehawk Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and an  indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of KBR (" **Merger Sub** ", and each of  the foregoing a "
**Party** " and collectively the  " **Parties** ").

  

  **_RECITALS_ :**

  

  A. The  respective boards of directors of BEandK, KBR and
Merger Sub have each approved this  Agreement, providing for the acquisition
by KBR of BEandK, through the merger of  Merger Sub with and into BEandK, with
BEandK surviving such merger (the  " **Merger** "), as a wholly owned
subsidiary of KBR, in accordance with  the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " **DGCL** "),  upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, and have adopted and  declared advisable this
Agreement;

  

  B. Concurrently  with the execution of this Agreement,
as a condition and an inducement to KBR's  and Merger Sub's willingness to
enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders  of BEandK are entering into
support agreements with KBR (each a " **Support  Agreement** "), pursuant to
which such stockholders have agreed to support the  Merger upon the terms and
conditions set forth therein.

  

  In  consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties,  covenants and agreements set forth below, the
Parties hereby agree as  follows:

applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged  with and into BEandK. The Merger shall have the effects specified
herein and in the  DGCL. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate

  _ _  Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective  Time_. Subject to
the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the conditions set  forth in

such  conditions), the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the  " **Closing** ") shall take place on July 1, 2008. If on July
1, 2008 such  conditions have not been so satisfied or waived, then the
Closing shall take place as  promptly as practicable thereafter (and in any
event within two Business Days) after  the satisfaction or, if permissible,
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article  6_ (other than those
conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied until the  Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions). The Closing of 
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at the
offices of  Andrews Kurth LLP in Houston, Texas, at 8:00 a.m., Houston time,
on the date of the  Closing, or at such other place and time as BEandK and KBR
shall agree. As part of  the Closing, the Parties shall cause the Merger to
be consummated by duly filing a  certificate of merger   
  

 (the  " **Certificate of Merger** ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of  Delaware in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance
with the relevant  provisions of, the DGCL (the date and time of such filing

The date of the Closing  is herein called the " **Closing Date** ".

  

    Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the  Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the DGCL. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the

    Section 1.4 _Governing Instruments; Directors  and
Officers of the Surviving Company_.

  

  (a) The  certificate of incorporation of

corporation as specified in such certificate of incorporation shall be amended
to  read as "BEandK, Inc.".

  

  (b) The  bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be  the bylaws of the
Surviving Company until duly amended in accordance with its terms and  the
DGCL, except that the name of the corporation as specified in such bylaws
shall be  amended to read as "BEandK, Inc.".

  

  (c) The  directors of Merger Sub and the
officers of BEandK (other than those who Merger Sub  determines shall not
remain as officers of the Surviving Company), in each case, as of  the
Effective Time, shall be the initial directors and officers, respectively, of

KBR,  Merger Sub, BEandK or the holders of any of the following securities:

  

  (a) Each  share of common stock of Merger Sub

  (b) Each  share of Class A common stock, par

issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time (other than
any shares of BEandK Class A Common Stock to  be canceled pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)_ or that constitute Appraisal Shares)  shall be converted into the
right to receive in cash an amount per share equal to the  Class A Per Share

     
  

Consideration.  The actual amount of the applicable Merger Consideration
attributable to any particular  holder of shares of BEandK Class A Common Stock
shall be the number of shares of  BEandK Class A Common Stock owned by such
holder times the Class A Per Share  Consideration, rounded to the nearest
$.01.

  

  (c) Each  share of Class B common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of BEandK (the  " **BE andK Class B Common Stock**")
issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time (other than
any shares of BEandK Class B Common Stock to  be canceled pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)_ or that constitute Appraisal Shares)  shall be converted into the
right to receive in cash an amount per share equal to the  Class B Per Share
Consideration. The actual amount of the applicable Merger  Consideration
attributable to any particular holder of shares of BEandK Class B  Common Stock
shall be the number of shares of BEandK Class B Common Stock owned by  such
holder times the Class B Per Share Consideration, rounded to the nearest 
$.01.

  

  (d) Each  share of BEandK Class A Common Stock,
BEandK Class B Common Stock and Series A  preferred stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of BEandK (the " **BE andK  Preferred Stock**") held in the treasury of
BEandK, or owned by any direct or  indirect Subsidiary of BEandK, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time,  shall be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no consideration shall be paid  with respect thereto.

  

  (e) From  and after the Effective Time, the
holders of BEandK Class A Common Stock and BEandK  Class B Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the  " **BE andK
Stockholders**") shall cease to have any rights with respect  to such capital
stock except for the right to receive the Merger Consideration in  respect of
such capital stock and except as otherwise provided herein or by the DGCL. 
At the Effective Time, the transfer books of BEandK shall be closed and,
thereafter,  there shall be no further registration of transfers of BEandK
Class A Common Stock or  BEandK Class B Common Stock.

  

  (f) For  purposes of this Agreement, each of
the following terms has the meaning set forth  below:

        



     |  



    
---|--- 
      



     |  

  (i)  " **Class A Per Share Consideration** "
means the dollar  amount (rounded to the nearest $0.0001) equal to the
quotient of (A) the  Final Purchase Price divided by (B) the aggregate number
of shares of  BEandK Class A Common Stock and BEandK Class B Common Stock that
are  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

    
      



     |  



    
      



     |  

  (ii)  " **Class B Per Share Consideration** "
means the dollar  amount (rounded to the nearest $0.0001) equal to the
quotient of (A) the  Final Purchase Price divided by (B) the aggregate number
of shares of  BEandK Class A Common Stock and BEandK Class B Common Stock that
are  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

    
      



     |  



    
      



     |  

  (iii)  " **Merger Consideration** " means the
consideration payable,  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as a result
of the Merger, to the  holders of BEandK Class A Common Stock and BEandK Class B

    Section 2.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate 
consideration to be received by the BEandK Stockholders in the Merger is to
consist  of the sum of $550,000,000, less the Deemed Appraisal Amount (the "
**Initial  Purchase Price** "). The Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted
pursuant to  _Section 2.4(b)_ (as so adjusted, the " **Final Purchase Price**
").  The " **Deemed Appraisal Amount** " means the aggregate dollar amount 
equal to the sum of (as a simultaneous calculation for clauses (i) and (ii))
(i) the  product of the number of Appraisal Shares that are comprised of BEandK
Class A Common  Stock, multiplied by the Class A Per Share Consideration that
would have been  calculated had there been no Appraisal Shares that are
comprised of BEandK Class A  Common Stock, and (ii) the product of the number
of Appraisal Shares that are comprised  of BEandK Class B Common Stock,
multiplied by the Class B Per Share Consideration  that would have been
calculated had there been no Appraisal Shares that are comprised  of BEandK
Class B Common Stock.

  

    Section 2.3 _Stockholders '  Representatives_.

  

  (a) In  order to efficiently administer the

acceptance of any of their Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement,
accept,  ratify and agree to the designation of, T. Michael Goodrich,
Theodore C. Kennedy and  Clyde M. Smith as representatives for the BEandK
Stockholders (the  " **Stockholders ' Representatives**"), and hereby and
thereby  authorize the Stockholders' Representatives to act on behalf of the

2.4_ , including, without  limitation, authorizing or consenting to

Stockholders' Representatives for  the accomplishment of the foregoing or as
contemplated to be taken by them under by the  terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement. In so acting, all decisions of the  Stockholders'
Representatives for all purposes of this Agreement and the Escrow  Agreement
shall be taken by the affirmative vote (or written consent) of a majority of 
the individuals then holding the title of a Stockholders' Representative, on
a  per capita basis.

  

  (b) If  any Stockholders' Representative
dies, becomes unable to perform his or her  responsibilities hereunder or
resigns from such position, the remaining  Stockholders' Representatives
shall, by majority vote on a per capita basis,  appoint a substitute
Stockholders' Representative and shall promptly notify KBR  and the Escrow
Agent thereof in writing.

     
  

  (c) No  bond shall be required of the
Stockholders' Representatives, and the  Stockholders' Representatives shall
receive no compensation for their services,  but they may be reimbursed from
the Escrow Expense Fund for any out-of-pocket expenses  actually incurred by
them in the performance of their duties as Stockholders'  Representatives.

  

  (d) KBR  shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on the instructions of a majority of the  Stockholders'
Representatives for each and every action purported to be taken by  the
Stockholders' Representatives hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement, 
without any duty of inquiry, and none of the Stockholders' Representatives or
any  of the BEandK Stockholders shall have any cause of action against KBR or
any of its  Affiliates for any action taken, or not taken, by KBR in reliance
upon the instructions  or decisions of a majority of the Stockholders'
Representatives. In all notices  and instructions to KBR by the Stockholders'
Representatives, the  Stockholders' Representatives shall certify that a
majority of the then existing  Stockholders' Representatives have approved of
such notice or  instruction.

  

  (e) The  provisions of this _Section 2.3_
shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal  representatives and
successors of each BEandK Stockholder, and any references in this  Agreement to
a BEandK Stockholder shall mean and include the successors to the rights  of
such BEandK Stockholder hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary
disposition,  the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

  

  (f) Upon  request of the Stockholders'
Representatives and/or the Escrow Agent, each  BEandK Stockholder shall
complete, execute and provide to the Stockholders'  Representatives and/or
the Escrow Agent, as applicable, certified tax identification  numbers by
furnishing IRS Forms W-9 (or Forms W-8, in the case of non-U.S. persons) and 
other forms, documents and information as the Stockholders' Representatives 
and/or the Escrow Agent may reasonably require in order to disburse any
amounts from  the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Excluded Business Escrow Fund or
the Expense Escrow Fund  to such BEandK Stockholder, and each of the BEandK
Stockholders agrees that if such  documentation is not so certified and
provided, the Escrow Agent may be required by the  Code to withhold and
promptly remit to the Internal Revenue Service a portion of any  interest or
other income earned on the investment of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the 
Excluded Business Escrow Fund or the Expense Escrow Fund.

  

  (g) All  decisions and actions by the
Stockholders' Representatives, including, without  limitation, any agreement
between the Stockholders' Representatives and KBR  relating to the defense or
settlement of any Claims for which indemnity may be sought  by any of the KBR
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Article 8_ , shall be binding  upon all of
the BEandK Stockholders, and no BEandK Stockholder shall have (A) the  right to
object, protest or otherwise contest the same or (B) any cause of action 
against the Stockholders' Representatives for any action taken, decision made
or  instruction given by the Stockholders' Representatives under this
Agreement or  the Escrow Agreement while acting in good faith, except for
intentional fraud or  willful breach of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement by the Stockholders'  Representatives.

  

  (h) Each  BEandK Stockholder agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders'  Representatives severally, pro
rata in accordance with each BEandK  Stockholder's ownership of the capital
stock of BEandK immediately prior to the  Effective Time, and not jointly, from
and against any and all (A) reasonable expenses  incurred by the
Stockholders' Representatives in connection with the performance  or
administration

     
  

of the  Stockholders' Representatives' duties hereunder, (B) reasonable legal
fees,  accounting fees and other fees and expenses incurred by the
Stockholders'  Representatives in connection with the performance or
administration of the  Stockholders' Representatives' duties hereunder, which
legal fees are  hereby authorized by the BEandK Stockholders, and (C) any
damages or expenses  asserted against, resulting to, or imposed upon, or
incurred or suffered by the  Stockholders' Representatives without
intentional fraud or willful misconduct on  the part of the Stockholders'
Representatives, and arising out of or in  connection with the acceptance,
performance or administration of the  Stockholders' Representatives' duties
hereunder. If the Stockholders'  Representatives are entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 2.3_ , the  Stockholders' Representatives
shall first cause the Escrow Agent to pay such  amounts from the Expense
Escrow Fund. If, at the time that the BEandK Stockholders  are entitled to a
distribution from the Indemnity Escrow Fund or the Excluded Business  Escrow
Fund, any BEandK Stockholder shall not have paid an obligation due to the 
Stockholders' Representatives pursuant to this Agreement, and such
obligation  cannot be satisfied from the Expense Escrow Fund, the
Stockholders'  Representatives may direct the Escrow Agent (as part of the
distribution instruction  given with respect to such distribution) to
distribute to the Stockholders'  Representatives the amount of such BEandK
Stockholder's obligation up to the  amount distributable to such BEandK
Stockholder, and such distribution to the  Stockholders' Representative shall
be in full satisfaction of such obligation to  the extent of the amount so
distributed.

  

  (i) The  Stockholders' Representatives shall
have no obligation to the BEandK  Stockholders to contest any Claim, or take
any other action hereunder or under the  Escrow Agreement requiring the
expenditure of funds by the Stockholders'  Representatives unless the
Stockholders' Representatives determine that the  amount of the Expense
Escrow Fund is sufficient to pay such expenditures or an  indemnity or other
security satisfactory to the Stockholder Representatives in their  sole
discretion is provided by some or all of the BEandK Stockholders.

  

    Section 2.4 _Closing Purchase Price  Adjustments and
Procedures._

  

  (a) The  Parties have agreed that the
Adjusted Stockholders' Equity of BEandK and its  Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis, after giving effect on a pro forma basis to (i)  the disposition of
the Excluded Businesses and (ii) the effectuation of all of the  actions
contemplated by _Sections 5.14_ and _5.16_ , is expected to be  $74,560,431
as of March 30, 2008 (the " **Expected Adjusted Stockholders '  Equity**").
Such dollar amount has been determined based on the pro forma  balance sheets
comprising _Exhibit A_ hereto and has been calculated in accordance  with
GAAP, subject to the accounting principles and adjustments set forth in
_Exhibit  A_ hereto (the " **Adjusted Stockholders ' Equity Adjustment 
Methodology**"). However, upon completion of the audit of BEandK's 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 30, 2008, BEandK and
KBR  shall cooperate and work together to amend and restate the Expected
Adjusted  Stockholders' Equity to take into account adjustments made from the
preliminary  consolidated financial statements of BEandK, utilized for purposes
of determining the  Expected Adjusted Stockholders' Equity for purposes of
this Agreement, in  completing such audited financial statements. In
addition, BEandK and KBR shall  cooperate and work together to amend and
restate the Expected Adjusted  Stockholders' Equity to update and adjust the
expected Tax costs and other Tax  impacts associated with the distribution to
the BEandK Stockholders of the Daugava  Hotel Interest as

     
  

contemplated by  _Section 5.14_ of the BEandK Disclosure Schedule, based on the
actual terms of  such distribution. For purposes of this Agreement, "
**Adjusted  Stockholders ' Equity**" means the total assets minus the total 
liabilities as of a specified date of BEandK and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated  basis, as determined in accordance with the Adjusted
Stockholders' Equity  Adjustment Methodology and after giving effect to (x)
the disposition of the Excluded  Businesses and (y) the effectuation of all
of the actions contemplated by _Sections  5.14_ and _5.16_. GAAP, subject to
the Adjusted Stockholders' Equity  Adjustment Methodology, shall be used in
the determination of the Closing Adjusted  Stockholders' Equity. For purposes
of this Agreement, " **GAAP** "  means U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, as in effect at the times relevant  for the preparation of the
particular financial statements in question (which, for  purposes of Adjusted
Stockholders' Equity, shall be deemed to mean as of March  30, 2008). All
determinations of Adjusted Stockholders' Equity, Expected Adjusted 
Stockholders' Equity, Closing Adjusted Stockholders Equity and Final
Adjusted  Stockholders' Equity (and any related determinations of income for
periods  relevant to such determination) shall be made disregarding the
effect of (i) any  accounting or tax elections or adjustments made at or
subsequent to the Closing,  including any such elections or adjustments that
are to be retroactive to a date prior  to the Closing, and (ii) any
restructuring or similar charge resulting from operational  or other changes
made at or subsequent to the Closing, in each case other than with  respect
to Taxes associated with the transactions contemplated by _Section 5.14_   of
the BEandK Disclosure Schedule.

  

  (b) The  Initial Purchase Price shall be
adjusted as follows:

        



     |  



    
---|--- 
      



     |  

  (i) Within  60 days after the Closing
Date, KBR shall, or shall cause BEandK to,  prepare and deliver to the
Stockholders' Representatives a statement  (the " **Adjustment Statement** ")
that shall set forth  KBR's calculation of Adjusted Stockholders' Equity, as
of the  Closing Date (in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (ii)
below),  prepared in accordance with the Adjusted Stockholders' Equity 
Adjustment Methodology (the " **Closing Adjusted Stockholders '  Equity**").
The Adjustment Statement shall include a reasonably  detailed calculation of
the Closing Adjusted Stockholders'  Equity.

    
      



     |  



    
      



     |  

  (ii) If  the Closing Date occurs on the
first Business Day of a BEandK Accounting  Month, then the Closing Adjusted
Stockholders' Equity shall be  determined as of the last day of the
immediately preceding BEandK  Accounting Month. If the Closing Date occurs on
the last Business Day of a  BEandK Accounting Month, then the Closing Adjusted
Stockholders'  Equity shall be determined as of the last day of such BEandK
Accounting  Month. If the Closing Date is on any other Business Day during a
particular  BEandK Accounting Month, the Closing Adjusted Stockholders'
Equity  shall be determined as follows: (A) Adjusted Stockholders' Equity 
shall be determined as of both the last day of the BEandK Accounting  Month
immediately preceding the BEandK Accounting Month in which the  Closing Date
occurs and the last day of the BEandK Accounting Month in  which the Closing
Date occurs; (B) the difference in the amount of Adjusted  Stockholders'
Equity as of such two dates shall be calculated and  divided by the number of
days in the BEandK Accounting Month in which the  Closing Date occurs; and (C)
the Adjusted Stockholders' Equity for  the BEandK Accounting Month preceding
the Closing Date shall be adjusted  (up if the amount of the Adjusted
Stockholders' Equity at of the end  of the BEandK Accounting Month in which the
Closing

    
       
        



     |  



    
---|--- 
      



     |  

Date  occurs is greater than the amount of Adjusted Stockholders' Equity at 
the end of the BEandK Accounting Month preceding the BEandK Accounting  Month in
which the Closing Date occurs, or down if the amount of the  Adjusted
Stockholders' Equity at of the end of the BEandK  Accounting Month in which the
Closing Date occurs is less than the amount  of Adjusted Stockholders' Equity
at the end of the BEandK  Accounting Month preceding the BEandK Accounting Month
in which the  Closing Date occurs) by the product of (x) the quotient
determined in  clause (B), multiplied by (y) the number of days that have
elapsed prior  to, but not including, the Closing Date in the BEandK Accounting
Month in  which the Closing Date occurs. For purposes of this Agreement,  "
**BE andK Accounting Month**" means an accounting month of  BEandK as previously
determined by BEandK in the ordinary course of  business, and which was
included in a listing of such months for 2008 that  BEandK provided to KBR in
writing prior to the date of this  Agreement.

    
      



     |  



    
      



     |  

  (iii) After  receipt of the Adjustment
Statement, the Stockholders'  Representatives shall have 20 Business Days to
review the factual basis,  mathematical calculations and accounting methods
used therein. During such  20-Business Day period, KBR and BEandK shall
reasonably cooperate with  the Stockholders' Representatives and their agents
and advisors in  connection with review of the Adjustment Statement by the 
Stockholders' Representatives and their agents and advisors by  promptly
providing all information and by providing access to all relevant  books,
records and employees of KBR and BEandK as are reasonably  requested by the
Stockholders' Representatives or any of their agents  or advisors in
connection with their review of the Adjustment Statement and  the calculation
of Closing Adjusted Stockholders' Equity. On or prior  to the 20th Business
Day after receipt of the Adjustment Statement, the  Stockholders'
Representatives shall deliver written notice to KBR  specifying in detail any
disputed items and the basis therefor. Any such  notice shall include only
objections based on (A) errors of fact underlying  the determination of
Closing Adjusted Stockholders' Equity, (B)  mathematical errors in the
computation of Closing Adjusted  Stockholders' Equity, and (C) Closing
Adjusted Stockholders'  Equity (including any portion of the balance sheet or
income statement  relevant to such determination) not having been determined
in accordance  with the Adjusted Stockholders' Equity Adjustment Methodology.
If the  Stockholders' Representatives fail so to notify KBR of any such 
disputes on or prior to the 20th Business Day after receipt of the 
Adjustment Statement, all calculations and valuations of Closing Adjusted 
Stockholders' Equity set forth on the Adjustment Statement shall be  deemed
accepted by the Stockholders' Representatives and shall be  final, binding,
conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes of this  Agreement.

    
      



     |  



    
      



     |  

  (iv) If  the Stockholders'
Representatives so notify KBR of any disputed items  on the Adjustment
Statement in accordance with the above provisions, KBR  and the Stockholders'
Representatives shall, over the 20 days  following the date of such notice
(the " **Resolution  Period** "), attempt to resolve their differences and
any written  resolution by them as to any disputed item shall be final,
binding,  conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes of this Agreement. If
at the  conclusion of the Resolution Period, KBR and the Stockholders' 
Representatives have not reached an agreement on the disputed items, then 
all items remaining in dispute shall be submitted by KBR and the 
Stockholders' Representatives to Deloitte and Touche LLP, or such  other
accounting firm or Person as may be agreed to

    
       
        



     |  



    
---|--- 
      



     |  

by  KBR and the Stockholders' Representatives (the " **Neutral  Auditor**
"). All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to  be performed by
the Neutral Auditor shall be borne 50% by the BEandK  Stockholders (as a
deduction to the Final Purchase Price and that shall be  paid by the Paying
Agent from the Holdback Amount) and 50% by KBR. The  Neutral Auditor shall
act as an arbitrator to determine only those items  still in dispute at the
end of the Resolution Period. In no event shall the  Neutral Auditor's
determination be outside of the range of amounts  claimed by the respective
parties with respect to those items in dispute.  The parties shall instruct
the Neutral Auditor to render its reasoned  written decision as soon as
practicable but in no event later than 45 days  after its engagement (which
engagement shall be made no later than 10  Business Days after the end of the
Resolution Period). Such decision shall  be set forth in a written statement
delivered to KBR and the  Stockholders' Representatives and shall be final,
binding, conclusive  and nonappealable for all purposes hereunder. The term "
**Final  Adjustment Statement** " shall mean the definitive Adjustment 
Statement agreed to (or deemed agreed to) by KBR and the  Stockholders'
Representatives in accordance with _Section  2.4(b)(iii)_ or this _Section
2.4(b)(iv)_ , or the definitive  Adjustment Statement resulting from the
determination made by the Neutral  Auditor in accordance with this _Section
2.4(b)(iv)_ , in each case  setting forth the final determination of the
Closing Adjusted  Stockholders' Equity as of the Closing Date, in accordance
with the  Adjusted Stockholders' Equity Adjustment Methodology (" **Final 
Adjusted Stockholders ' Equity**").

    
      



     |  



    
      



     |  

  (v) If  the dollar amount of the Final
Adjusted Stockholders' Equity exceeds  the dollar amount of the Estimated
Adjusted Stockholders' Equity, KBR  shall pay (A) to the Paying Agent for
inclusion as part of the Exchange  Fund an amount equal to 90% of such excess
and (B) to the Escrow Agent for  inclusion as part of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund an amount equal to 10% of  such excess. If the dollar amount of the
Estimated Adjusted  Stockholders' Equity exceeds the dollar amount of the
Final Adjusted  Stockholders' Equity, (C) the Paying Agent shall pay to KBR
an amount  from the Exchange Fund equal to 90% of such excess and (D) the
Escrow Agent  shall pay to KBR an amount from the Indemnity Escrow Fund equal
to 10% of  such excess. Amounts owing by the parties pursuant to the
foregoing shall  be aggregated or netted, as applicable, to minimize the
number of payments.  Any payments required pursuant to this _Section
2.4(b)(v)_ shall be  made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account  designated by KBR, the Escrow Agent or the Paying Agent, as the
case may  be, in United States Dollars, within three Business Days after the
Final  Adjustment Statement has been determined. Each disbursement by the
Paying  Agent from the Holdback Amount (including disbursements under
_Section  2.4(d)_ ) shall include interest thereon, at the rate of interest
earned  on the Holdback Amount under the paying agent agreement between KBR
and the  Paying Agent in connection with _Section 2.7_ , from and including
the  Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment. All other payments
due  under this _Section 2.4(b)(v)_ shall be paid together with interest, 
at the rate of interest earned on the Holdback Amount under the paying  agent
agreement between KBR and the Paying Agent in connection with  _Section 2.7_
, from and including the Closing Date to but excluding  the date of payment.
KBR shall work with the Paying Agent so that the  Paying Agent will provide
notice of such interest rate. Notwithstanding any  other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any interest payment  deposited by KBR in the
Exchange Fund pursuant to

    
       
        



     |  



    
---|--- 
      



     |  

this  _Section 2.4(b)(v)_ and any interest earned in the Exchange Fund 
through the date of the Final Adjustment Statement on the portion (which  may
be all) of the Holdback Amount that is to be distributed to the  BEandK
Stockholders from the Exchange Fund shall be treated as an  increase in the
Final Purchase Price and distributed to the BEandK  Stockholders as Merger
Consideration. For purposes of clarity, except to  the extent specified in
the seventh and eighth sentences of _Section  2.7(b)_ , no amounts from the
Holdback Amount may be distributed to the  BEandK Stockholders prior to the
date that is two Business Days after the  last to occur of the payment of any
funds due KBR in accordance with  _Section 2.4(d)_ and the payment to KBR of
any funds due in accordance  with _Section 2.7(b)_ in respect of remaining
North Star Payment  Obligations, and any such distributions shall otherwise
be in accordance  with _Section 2.7(b)_.

    
    

  (c)   If the Closing has occurred prior to
the distribution of all funds under the Escrow  Agreement 1, dated February
29, 2008 between BEandK and Neste Jacobs Oy, or any other  funds due to BEandK
under the Rintekno Purchase Agreement (other than from the  Rintekno Escrow,
for which provision is made in the next sentence), then promptly after  the
termination of such escrow agreement or the receipt of such other funds KBR
shall  deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent a dollar
amount equal to the  amount of the escrow funds or such other funds, if any,
received by BEandK after the  Closing in accordance with the terms of such
escrow agreement or the Rintekno Purchase  Agreement. Promptly after the
termination of the Rintekno Escrow, KBR shall deposit, or  cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent a dollar amount equal to the amount of the 
escrow funds, if any, received by BEandK in accordance with the terms of the
escrow  agreement governing the Rintekno Escrow. All such amounts so
deposited shall be treated  as an increase in the Final Purchase Price and
distributed to the BEandK Stockholders  as Merger Consideration. Promptly after
the termination of the North Star Escrow, KBR  shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent a dollar amount equal to  the amount of the
escrow funds, if any, received by BEandK or any of its wholly-owned 
Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement governing
the North  Star Escrow. Such amount so deposited shall be treated as an
increase in the Final  Purchase Price and distributed to the BEandK
Stockholders as Merger  Consideration.

  

  (d) The  Parties acknowledge that there may
be accounts receivable associated with North Star  that are not purchased or
otherwise included in the North Star Sale. In such event, KBR  shall, for the
90-day period following Closing, cause the Surviving Company and its 
Subsidiaries to use reasonable, good faith efforts toward the collection of
such  receivables, subject to current write-offs and collection practices,
_provided,  however_ , that none of KBR, the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall  have any responsibility or liability with regard to such
collections nor be expected to  incur any cost with respect to collections
and none of them shall be required to  initiate legal proceedings against any
Person in connection with any receivable. Upon  collection of any such
accounts receivable during the 90 days following Closing, KBR  shall cause
BEandK and its Subsidiaries to use such collections to pay-off the North  Star
Payment Obligations. At such time as there are no longer any remaining North
Star  Payment Obligations, KBR shall cause any further collections of such
accounts  receivable during the 90 days following Closing to be deposited on
a weekly basis with  the Paying Agent and disbursed by the Paying Agent to
the BEandK Stockholders as  Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.7(b)_. Thereafter, KBR shall  cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to hold any further collections on  such accounts receivable and
to turn over such collections and to assign any such  remaining receivables

     
  

as the  Stockholders' Representatives may instruct in writing (provided that
the Paying  Agent has released to KBR or its designee sufficient funds to pay
any remaining balance  then outstanding of North Star Payment Obligations in
accordance with _Section  2.7(b)_ ). After the Closing, KBR shall notify the
Stockholders'  Representatives every two weeks of the collection of any such
accounts receivable and  the use of the funds associated therewith, as
contemplated by this _Section  2.4(d)_.

  

    Section 2.5 _Escrow Arrangement_. At  Closing, the sum
of (a) 10% of the Initial Purchase Price (such cash, together with any 
subsequent deposit made by KBR in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)(v)_ , and
any  earnings or interest thereon, are referred to herein as the "
**Indemnity Escrow  Fund** "), (b) $5,000,000 of the Initial Purchase Price
(such cash, together  with any earnings or interest thereon, are referred to
herein as the " **Excluded  Business Escrow Fund** ") and (c) $3,000,000 of
the Initial Purchase Price (such  cash, together with any earnings or
interest thereon, are referred to herein as the  " **Expense Escrow Fund**
"), shall be deposited by KBR with JPMorgan  Chase Bank, National Association
(or such other bank as may be mutually agreeable by  KBR and BEandK), as Escrow
Agent (the " **Escrow Agent** "), pursuant to  an escrow agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the  " **Escrow
Agreement** "). KBR shall be entitled, at any time and from  time to time on
or prior to the day that is 18 months following the Closing Date, to  submit
to the Escrow Agent a claim (a " **Claim** **Notice** ") for  Damages claimed
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ (such Damages and such amounts, each a  " **Claim**
"). KBR shall be entitled, at any time and from time to time  on or prior to
April 1, 2010, to submit to the Escrow Agent a Claim Notice for Claims 
pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(iii)_. Any such Claim Notice submitted by KBR to
the  Escrow Agent shall also be simultaneously provided in writing to the 
Stockholders' Representatives, and such notice shall state with particularity
the  nature and amount of the Claim and the basis for which KBR is entitled
to compensation  for such Claim under this Agreement. A Claim Notice may
instruct the Escrow Agent to  deliver to KBR, or its designee, in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement  such portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Fund or the Excluded Business Escrow Fund, as  appropriate, as shall satisfy
the amount of such Claims by KBR; it being understood  that (i) Claim Notices
with respect to Claims pursuant to _Sections 8.2(a)(i)_ or  _8.2(a)(ii)_ may
only be submitted with respect to, and paid from, the Indemnity  Escrow Fund
and (ii) no amounts may be paid from either the Excluded Business Escrow 
Fund or the Indemnity Escrow Fund with respect to Claims arising from claims
made under  the Rintekno Purchase Agreement or the purchase agreement to be
executed in connection  with the North Star Sale as described in _Section
5.14_ of the BEandK Disclosure  Letter until all amounts in the Rintekno Escrow
or the North Star Escrow, as  applicable, have been paid out in accordance
with their terms, provided such claims may  be paid from the Rintekno Escrow
or the North Star Escrow, as applicable, in accordance  with their terms. The
Stockholders' Representatives may within 20 Business Days  after receiving a
Claim Notice give notice to KBR and the Escrow Agent of any good  faith
objection thereto (an " **Objection Notice** "). If the  Stockholders'
Representatives fail to deliver timely an Objection Notice, then  the Escrow
Agent shall distribute to KBR such portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund or 
Excluded Business Escrow Fund, as applicable, as shall satisfy such Claim
described in  such Claim Notice, all in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.
If the  Stockholders' Representatives timely deliver an Objection Notice,
then KBR and  the Stockholders' Representatives shall promptly, and in any
event within 10 days  after delivery of the Objection Notice, meet to attempt
to resolve any disputes with  respect thereto. Any unresolved disputes shall
be resolved in the manner referred to in  the Escrow Agreement. The Indemnity
Escrow Fund, the Excluded Business Escrow Fund and  the Expense Escrow Fund
shall terminate, and the final payments of any  amounts

     
  

remaining in  such funds at the time of such termination shall be made, as
set forth in the Escrow  Agreement. KBR shall be responsible for all fees and
expenses of the Escrow Agent.  Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall be authorized and directed to  make any payments required to be
made by it as contemplated by _Section  2.4(e)(iv)_.

  

    Section 2.6 _Appraisal Rights_.  Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the  " **Appraisal
Shares** ") of BEandK Class A Common Stock and BEandK  Class B Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  that are held
by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of 
such Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
the  provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" **Section 262** ") shall not
be  converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
in _Section  2.1_ , but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of
the fair value of such  Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262. At the Effective  Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be  canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to  have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of  such Appraisal Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding  anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or  otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262, or a  court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the  relief provided by Section 262, then the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value  of such holder's Appraisal Shares
under Section 262 shall cease and such  Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
considered to be Appraisal Shares, and shall be  deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the  right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1_ , and KBR 
shall (i) deposit into the Exchange Fund 90% of the amount of the Deemed
Appraisal  Amount with respect to such former Appraisal Shares and (ii)
deposit into the Indemnity  Escrow Fund 10% of the amount of the Deemed
Appraisal Amount with respect to such  former Appraisal Shares. Promptly
after the date of this Agreement, BEandK shall  provide the notice contemplated
by subsection (d)(2) of Section 262 to the BEandK  Stockholders and otherwise
comply with Section 262. BEandK shall serve prompt notice  to KBR of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of BEandK Class A Common Stock and  BEandK
Class B Common Stock, and KBR shall have the right to participate in and 
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the  Effective Time, BEandK shall not, without the prior written consent of
KBR,  voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such  demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

    Section 2.7 _Exchange of  Certificates._

  

  (a) Prior  to the Effective Time, KBR shall
appoint JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association or  another comparable bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to BEandK to act as  paying agent (the "
**Paying Agent** ") for the payment of the Merger  Consideration. At the
Effective Time, KBR shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the  benefit of
the BEandK Stockholders, cash in an amount equal to (i) the Closing Date 
Purchase Price less (ii) the amount of cash deposited by KBR with the Escrow
Agent  pursuant to the terms of _Section 2.4_ (such cash, together with any
subsequent  deposits made by KBR with the Paying Agent in accordance with
_Section 2.4(b)(v)_   and by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, being hereinafter  referred to as the " **Exchange Fund** ").

     
  

  (b) As  promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (and in any event within five Business  Days after the
Effective Time), KBR shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder  of
record of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any  shares of BEandK Class A Common Stock or BEandK Class B Common
(each, a  " **Certificate** ") and that were converted into the right to
receive the  Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that  delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates held by such  person shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent  and that shall be in customary form
and have such other provisions as KBR may  reasonably specify and BEandK may
reasonably approve before Closing) and (ii)  instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the  Merger
Consideration. KBR and BEandK shall cooperate with each other to the extent 
practicable to facilitate the submission of letters of transmittal prior to
the Closing  Date such that the payment of Merger Consideration may be made
as soon as practicable  after the Closing. Each holder of record of a
Certificate shall, upon surrender to the  Paying Agent of such Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly  executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,  be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash that the number of  shares of
BEandK Class A Common Stock or BEandK Class B Common Stock previously 
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to
receive  pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be  canceled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as specified in
the seventh and eighth  sentences of this _Section 2.7(b)_ , until two
Business Days after both (x) the  Final Purchase Price has been determined in
accordance with _Section 2.4_ and (y)  the payment of any funds due KBR in
accordance with this _Section 2.7(b)_ because  of remaining North Star
Payable Obligations, the Paying Agent shall not distribute to  the BEandK
Stockholders from the initial deposit by KBR to the Exchange Fund a dollar 
amount equal to the Holdback Amount, in order that sufficient funds may be
returned to  KBR as contemplated by _Section 2.4(b)(v)_ and this _Section
2.7(b)_. For  purposes of this Agreement, " **Holdback Amount** " means an
aggregate  dollar amount equal to the sum of (A) 10% of the Expected Adjusted
Stockholders'  Equity and (B) the dollar amount, without any discounts, of
all North Star Payment  Obligations existing as of the Closing Date. If any
such North Star Payment Obligations  remain outstanding as of the date that
is 90 days after the Closing Date, then KBR  shall be entitled to instruct,
in writing (with a copy thereof to the  Stockholders' Representatives), the
Paying Agent to pay to KBR from the Holdback  Amount such dollar amount that
equals the aggregate dollar amount of all North Star  Payment Obligations
then remaining outstanding. After the Closing, KBR shall notify the  Paying
Agent and the Stockholders' Representatives every two weeks of the 
collection of any accounts receivable associated with North Star and the pay-
off of  North Star Payment Obligations, as contemplated by _Section 2.4(d)_ ,
and the  Paying Agent shall, upon receipt of each such notice, release (on
such time periods as  may be reasonably scheduled by KBR and the
Stockholders' Representatives) from  such Holdback Amount an amount equal to
the dollar amount of the North Star Payment  Obligations so paid-off and set
forth in such notices from KBR, and such released  amounts shall be disbursed
by the Paying Agent to the BEandK Stockholders as Merger  Consideration. In
addition, the Paying Agent shall disburse, as Merger Consideration,  to the
BEandK Stockholders, on such time periods as may be reasonably scheduled by 
KBR and the Stockholders' Representatives, such dollar amounts as shall be 
deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_ or _Section 
5.14_. The Paying Agent shall deduct from the Merger Consideration otherwise
then  payable to each BEandK Stockholder such BEandK Stockholder's pro rata
share  of the Holdback Amount. Once the Final Purchase Price has been
determined in

     
  

accordance with  _Section 2.4(b)_ , the Paying Agent shall, upon written
notice to such effect from  KBR, with a copy thereof to the Stockholders'
Representatives, and after all the  payments to or from the Exchange Fund
contemplated by _Section 2.4(b)(v)_ have  been made in accordance with such
provision, distribute the remaining portion of the  Merger Consideration in
the Exchange Fund (including any remaining portion of the  Holdback Amount)
on the terms and conditions as contemplated herein, including making a 
supplemental distribution to those BEandK Stockholders to whom an initial
payment of  a portion of the Final Purchase Price has already been made. In
the event of a transfer  of ownership of BEandK Class A Common Stock or BEandK
Class B Common Stock that is  not registered in the transfer records of BEandK,
payment of the Merger Consideration  may be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so  surrendered is registered if, upon
presentation to the Paying Agent, such Certificate  shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person 
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the  payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of  such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of KBR that such Taxes  have been paid or are not applicable.
Except as specifically provided herein with  respect to the Holdback Amount,
any amount paid by KBR pursuant to _Section  2.4(b)(v)_ and to the extent
contemplated in _Section 2.5_ , no interest shall  be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the  provisions of
this _Article 2_.

  

  (c) All  cash paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this  _Article 2_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights  pertaining to
the shares of BEandK Class A Common Stock and BEandK Class B Common  Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates. If, after the Effective Time, any 
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent for any
reason,  it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof
as provided in this  _Article 2_.

  

  (d) Any  portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the  Certificates for 30 months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to KBR, upon  demand, and any holders
of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this  _Article 2_
shall thereafter look only to KBR for, and KBR shall remain liable  for,
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this 
_Article 2_.

  

  (e) None  of KBR, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any  person in respect of any
cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public  official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any 
Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on
which any  Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any  Governmental Agency, any such Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by  Applicable Laws, become the property of KBR. KBR
shall thereafter remain liable for  payment of claims for Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Article 2_ by  any holder of
Certificates against such cash amount.

  

  (f) The  Paying Agent shall invest the cash
in the Exchange Fund as directed by KBR, so long as  the selected investment
choice is substantially comparable to an available investment  choice set
forth in the Escrow Agreement. Except as specifically provided herein with 
respect to the Holdback Amount and any amount

     
  

paid by KBR  pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(v)_ , any interest and other income
resulting from such  investments shall be paid to KBR. KBR shall work with
the Paying Agent so that the  Paying Agent will make any payments required to
be made by it as contemplated by  _Section 2.4(b)(v)_.

  

  (g) If  any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an  affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or  destroyed and, if
required by KBR, an agreement to indemnify KBR or the posting by such  Person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as KBR may direct as indemnity against
any  claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent  shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable  Merger Consideration with respect thereto. KBR,
the Surviving Company or the Paying  Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable  pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of BEandK Class A Common Stock and  BEandK Class B Common
Stock such amounts as KBR, the Surviving Company or the Paying  Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment 
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that  amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority by KBR, the  Surviving Company or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all  purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of BEandK  Class A Common Stock and BEandK Class
B Common Stock in respect of which such  deduction and withholding was made
by KBR, the Surviving Company or the Paying  Agent.

  

  **ARTICLE 3 
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING BEandK 
  AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES**

  

  Except  as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to KBR
by BEandK at or prior to the  execution of this Agreement (the " **BE andK
Disclosure Letter**") and  making reference in the BEandK Disclosure Letter to
the particular subsection of this  Agreement to which exception is being
taken ( _provided_ that any information set  forth in one section or
subsection of the BEandK Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to  apply to each
other section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is reasonably 
apparent), BEandK represents and warrants to KBR and Merger Sub as  follows:

  

    Section 3.1 _Existence; Good Standing;  Corporate
Authority_. BEandK is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing  and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. BEandK is duly 
qualified to do business and, to the extent such concept or a similar concept
exists in  the relevant jurisdiction, is in good standing under the laws of
any jurisdiction in  which the character of the properties owned or leased by
it therein or in which the  transaction of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be  so qualified or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is  not
reasonably likely to have a BEandK Material Adverse Effect. BEandK has all 
requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to  carry on its business as now conducted.

  

    Section 3.2 _Authorization, Validity and  Effect of
Agreements_. BEandK has the requisite corporate power and authority to  execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
by  this Agreement. The execution of this Agreement and the consummation by
BEandK of the  transactions contemplated

     
  

hereby have been  duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on behalf
of BEandK, subject in the  case of consummation of the Merger to the approval
of this Agreement by the holders of  a majority of the outstanding shares of
BEandK Class A Common Stock as contemplated  by _Section 5.15_. BEandK has duly
executed and delivered this Agreement.  Assuming this Agreement constitutes
the valid and legally binding obligation of KBR and  Merger Sub, this
Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of  BEandK,
enforceable against BEandK in accordance with its terms, subject to  applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws 
relating to creditors' rights and general principles of equity.

  

    Section 3.3 _Board Recommendation; Required  Vote_. The
board of directors of BEandK, at a meeting duly called and held, has by  the
requisite vote under the DGCL and BEandK's certificate of incorporation and 
bylaws (a) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby are  advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders
of BEandK, (b)  approved and adopted this Agreement and (c) resolved to
recommend that the holders of  the BEandK Class A Common Stock adopt this
Agreement (the " **BE andK Board  Recommendation**"). The affirmative consent
or vote of holders of a majority of  the outstanding shares of BEandK Class A
Common Stock is the only action of the  holders of any class or series of
capital stock of BEandK necessary to adopt this  Agreement under the DGCL and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of BEandK  (the " **BE andK
Stockholder Approval**"). All dividends on the BEandK  Preferred Stock are
current to the most recent quarterly dividend payment date, and no  payment
of quarterly dividends with respect to the BEandK Preferred Stock is in 
arrears.

  

    Section 3.4 _Capitalization of the  Company_.

  

  (a) The  authorized capital stock of BEandK
consists of 2,900,000 shares of BEandK Class A  Common Stock, 3,100,000 shares
of BEandK Class B Common Stock and 25,000 shares of  preferred stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of BEandK, of which 6,500 shares of  BEandK Preferred Stock have
been designated and authorized for issuance pursuant to a  Certificate of
Designations of Series A Preferred Stock of BEandK, Inc. dated June  20, 1995,
as amended by an Amended Certificate of Designations dated September 15, 
1995. There are (i) 2,680,436 shares of BEandK Class A Common Stock issued and 
outstanding, (ii) 1,234,248.209 shares of BEandK Class B Common Stock issued
and  outstanding, (iii) 5,543 shares of BEandK Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding,  (iv) no shares of BEandK Class A Common Stock or BEandK Preferred
Stock held in  treasury by BEandK or Subsidiaries of BEandK, (v) no shares of
BEandK Class B  Common Stock held in treasury by BEandK and (vi) no shares of
BEandK Class B Common  Stock reserved for issuance under BEandK's Key Employees
Stock Purchase Plan.  Except as set forth above in this _Section 3.4_ , no
shares of capital stock or  other voting securities of BEandK are issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding.  All of the issued and outstanding
shares of BEandK Class A Common Stock, BEandK  Class B Common Stock Common and
BEandK Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and  validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable, and were issued in accordance with  any
preemptive rights that were in effect at the time of such issuance. BEandK
does  not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls,  preemptive rights, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase  or issuance of any shares of BEandK Class A
Common Stock, BEandK Class B Common  Stock or BEandK Preferred Stock or any
other, or exercisable or exchangeable for any,  equity securities of BEandK or
any securities representing the right to purchase or  otherwise receive any
shares of capital stock of BEandK. There are no  shares

     
  

of capital stock  of BEandK subject to vesting, transfer restrictions (other
than as imposed by  Applicable Law), stock appreciation rights, "phantom"
stock rights,  performance units, or other rights that are linked to the
value of capital stock of  BEandK. _Section 3.4(a)_ of the BEandK Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list  of the holders of record as of March 30, 2008 of
any BEandK Class A Common Stock,  BEandK Class B Common Stock or BEandK Preferred
Stock.

  

  (b) The  issuance and sale of all of the
shares of capital stock described in this _Section  3.4_ have been in
compliance in all material respects with United States federal and  state
securities laws. Neither BEandK nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to 
register any securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under
any  state securities law or granted registration rights to any individual
or  entity.

  

    Section 3.5 _Subsidiaries._

  

  (a) BEandK  does not own, directly or
indirectly, any equity or other ownership interest in any  corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other entity or 
enterprise, except as set forth in _Section 3.5_ to the BEandK Disclosure 
Letter. Such listing in such _Section 3.5_ states whether such equity or
other  ownership interests are in a Subsidiary of BEandK or in another Person
that does not  constitute a Subsidiary of BEandK (a " **Non-Subsidiary Entity**
"), and  designates certain Non-Subsidiary Entities as " **Non-Subsidiary
Operating  Entities** ". BEandK is not subject to any obligation or requirement
to  provide material funds to or make any material investment (in the form of
a loan,  capital contribution or otherwise) in any of its Subsidiaries or in
any Non-Subsidiary  Entity. BEandK owns, directly or indirectly, each of the
outstanding shares of  capital stock (or other ownership interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power  to elect directors or others performing
similar functions with respect to such  Subsidiary) of each of its
Subsidiaries. Each of the outstanding shares of capital  stock, member
interests, partnership interests and other equity interests of each of 
BEandK's Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and 
nonassessable, and is owned, directly or indirectly, by BEandK free and clear of
all  Liens. The following information for each of BEandK's Subsidiaries is set
forth  in _Section 3.5_ to the BEandK Disclosure Letter, as applicable: (i) its
name  and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization; (ii) its authorized
capital stock or  share capital; and (iii) the number of issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock  or share capital and the record owner(s)
thereof. There are no outstanding  subscriptions, options, warrants, puts,
calls, agreements, understandings, claims or  other commitments or rights of
any type relating to the issuance, sale or transfer of  any securities of any
of BEandK's Subsidiaries, nor are there outstanding any  securities that are
convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock or  other
voting securities or ownership interests of any of BEandK's Subsidiaries.  Each
Subsidiary of BEandK is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, 
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is  organized and has the requisite corporate or other business
entity power and authority  to carry on its business as now being conducted,
except where such failure,  individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to  have a BEandK Material Adverse Effect.
Each of BEandK's Subsidiaries is duly  qualified or licensed or admitted to do
business and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction in which the nature of
its business or the ownership, use or leasing of  its properties makes such
qualification or licensing or admission necessary, other than  in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or admitted, 
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to  have a BEandK Material Adverse Effect.

     
  

BEandK has  made available to KBR true and complete copies of the certificate
of incorporation and  bylaws of BEandK, as amended to the date of this
Agreement, and the comparable  charter and organizational documents of each
Subsidiary of BEandK, in each case as  amended through the date of this
Agreement.

  

  (b) Each  of the outstanding shares of
capital stock, member interests, partnership interests and  other equity
interests owned by BEandK and its Subsidiaries in each Non-Subsidiary  Entity
is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and is
owned,  directly or indirectly, by BEandK free and clear of all Liens. The
following  information with respect to each of the Non-Subsidiary Operating
Entities is set forth  in _Section 3.5_ to the BEandK Disclosure Letter, as
applicable: (i) the name,  type of entity and jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization and (ii) the number of  shares of capital stock or other
share capital or equity interests owned by BEandK  and its Subsidiaries, and
the ownership percentage such shares or share capital or  equity interests
represent in such Non-Subsidiary Operating Entity. BEandK has made  available
to KBR, to the knowledge of BEandK, true and complete copies of the 
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or comparable charter and
organization  documents, and any joint venture or operating agreement, of
each Non-Subsidiary  Operating Entity, in each case as amended through the
date of this Agreement. BEandK  and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with each agreement to  which it is a party and that relate
to a Non-Subsidiary Operating Entity.

  

    Section 3.6 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.  Except for
such matters as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not 
reasonably likely to have a BEandK Material Adverse Effect:

  

  (a) Neither  BEandK nor any Subsidiary of BEandK
is in violation of any applicable law, rule,  regulation, code, ordinance,
governmental determination, order, treaty, convention,  governmental
certification requirement or other public limitation (collectively,  "
**Applicable Laws** "), and no claim is pending or, to the knowledge of 
BEandK, threatened against BEandK or any Subsidiary of BEandK with respect to any 
such matters. No condition exists that does or could reasonably be expected
to  constitute a violation of or deficiency under any Applicable Law by BEandK
or any  Subsidiary of BEandK.

  

  (b) BEandK  and each Subsidiary of BEandK hold
all permits, licenses, certifications, variances,  exemptions, orders,
franchises and approvals of each governmental or regulatory  authority,
commission, board or other regulatory body, administrative agency or 
tribunal (" **Governmental Agency** ") necessary for the lawful conduct of 
their respective businesses (the " **BE andK Permits**"). All BEandK  Permits are
in full force and effect, there exists no defaults thereunder or breaches 
thereof by BEandK or any of its Subsidiaries, and BEandK has no notice or actual 
knowledge that such BEandK Permits will not be renewed in the ordinary course.
No  Governmental Agency has given, or to the knowledge of BEandK threatened to
give, any  notice regarding any action to terminate, cancel or reform any
BEandK  Permit.

  

  (c) BEandK  and each Subsidiary of BEandK possess
all permits, licenses, operating authorities,  orders, exemptions,
franchises, variances, consents, approvals or other authorizations  required
for the present ownership and operation of all their real property or 
leasehold interests in real property (" **BE andK Real  Property**")

     
  

as of the date  of this Agreement. _Section 3.6_ of the BEandK Disclosure
Letter sets forth a  listing of all the BEandK Real Property. There exists no
default or breach with  respect to, and no party or Governmental Agency has
taken or, to the knowledge of  BEandK, threatened to take, any action to
terminate, cancel or reform any such  permit, license, operating authority,
order, exemption, franchise, variance, consent,  approval or other
authorization pertaining to the BEandK Real Property.

  

    Section 3.7 _No Conflict._

  

  (a) Neither  the execution and delivery by
BEandK of this Agreement nor the consummation by  BEandK of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the  terms hereof will (i)
conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the  certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of BEandK, as amended and in effect on the  date
hereof, true, complete and correct copies of which have been provided to KBR,
(ii)  violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of,
or constitute a  default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a  default) under, or result in the termination or in
a right of termination or  cancellation of, or give rise to a right of
purchase under, or accelerate the  performance required by, or result in the
creation of any lien, pledge, security  interest, claim, charge, mortgage,
deed of trust, easement, right of way, reservation,  option, right of first
refusal or other encumbrance (collectively,  " **Liens** ") upon any of the
properties of BEandK or its Subsidiaries  under, or result in being declared
void, voidable, or without further binding effect,  or otherwise result in a
detriment to BEandK or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of  the terms,
conditions or provisions of, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of 
trust, license, concession, franchise, permit, lease, contract, agreement,
joint  venture or other instrument or obligation to which BEandK or any of its
Subsidiaries  is a party, or by which BEandK or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their properties  may be bound or affected or (iii) subject to the filings
and other matters referred to  in _Section 3.7(b)_ , contravene or conflict
with or constitute a violation of any  provision of any Applicable Law,
judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable  to BEandK or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as, in the case of matters described in  clause (ii) or
(iii), individually or in the aggregate, that have not had and are not 
reasonably likely to have a BEandK Material Adverse Effect.

  

  (b) Neither  the execution and delivery by
BEandK of this Agreement nor the consummation by  BEandK of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof  will require any
consent, approval, qualification or authorization of, or filing or 
registration with, any court or Governmental Agency by BEandK or any of its 
Subsidiaries, other than (i) filings required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust  Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " **HSR Act** "), and
the  filings and notifications by BEandK or any of its Subsidiaries required
under  applicable non-US antitrust laws set forth in _Section 3.7(b)_ of the
BEandK  Disclosure Letter and (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary  of State of the State of Delaware, except for any consent,
approval, qualification or  authorization the failure to obtain which, and
for any filing or registration the  failure to make which, has not had and is
not reasonably likely to have a BEandK  Material Adverse Effect.

  

  (c) This  Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby do not, and will not,  upon consummation of
such transactions in accordance with their terms, result in any  "change of
control" or similar event or circumstance under (i) the terms of  any BEandK
PandM Contract or (ii) any contract or plan under

     
  

which any  employees, officers or directors of BEandK or any of its
Subsidiaries are entitled to  payments or benefits, which, in the case of
clause (ii), gives rise to rights or  benefits not otherwise available absent
such change of control or similar event and  requires either a cash payment
or an accounting charge in accordance with GAAP, or  (iii) any material BEandK
Permit.

  

    Section 3.8 _Financial Statements; Controls  and
Procedures._

  

  (a) _  Section 3.8_ of the BEandK Disclosure
Letter contains a copy of the (i) audited  consolidated balance sheets and
statements of income and cash flows of BEandK and its  Subsidiaries as of, and
for the years ended, April 1, 2007 and April 2, 2006 and (ii)  the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of BEandK and its Subsidiaries as of March  30, 2008
(the " **Most Recent Balance Sheet "**), and the related  statement of income
for the period then ending (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the  "
**Financial Statements** "). Each of the Financial Statements fairly 
presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and the results of
the  operations of BEandK and its Subsidiaries, as of the dates and for the
respective  periods indicated. The Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with (x)  the books and records of BEandK and its Subsidiaries and
(y) GAAP, as in effect at  the times relevant for the preparation of such
Financial Statements, applied on a  consistent basis throughout the periods
involved, subject, in the case of the unaudited  financial statements, to
normal year-end adjustments (which are in the aggregate not  expected to be
material to BEandK) and to the absence of notes thereto.

  

  (b) _  Section 3.8_ of the BEandK Disclosure
Letter sets forth, as of the date of this  Agreement, an itemized list
(including lender and amount outstanding) of all  Indebtedness of BEandK and
its Subsidiaries.

  

  (c) Each  of BEandK and its Subsidiaries
maintains books and records reflecting in all material  respects its assets
and liabilities and that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly  reflect
in all material respects the transactions and dispositions of the assets of 
BEandK and its Subsidiaries, and each maintains proper and adequate internal 
accounting controls that provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions
are  executed with management's authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded
as  necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements
of BEandK  and its Subsidiaries and to maintain accountability for the
consolidated assets; (iii)  access to the assets of BEandK and its Subsidiaries
is permitted only in accordance  with management's authorization; (iv) the
reporting of the assets of BEandK and  its Subsidiaries is compared with

action or event would be  required to cause such payment or benefit to be
triggered. The execution of, and  performance of the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement will not (either alone  or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event  under

connection therewith) that will or may result in any payment (whether of
severance pay  or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution,  increase in benefits or obligations to fund benefits

commitment or promise to establish, any new BEandK Benefit  Plan, (v) any
grant, or any commitment or promise to grant, any stock options, stock

  (f) During  the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, except as otherwise  permitted under this
Agreement, neither BEandK nor any of its ERISA Affiliates shall  enter into any
additional contracts, agreements or employee benefit plans or  arrangements

Effective Time,  or make or agree to make any material changes to any
existing contracts, agreements or  employee benefit plans with employees,
officers, directors or consultants of BEandK  and/or any of its ERISA

unrelated business taxable income under Code Section 511. The Company VEBA is
exempt  from federal tax. No event has occurred or circumstance exists that
will or could give  rise to disqualification or loss of tax-exempt status of
the Company VEBA. BEandK and  any

     
  

of its ERISA  Affiliates have made appropriate entries in their financial
records and statements for  all obligations and liabilities under the Company

VEBA is pending or, to the knowledge of BEandK, is  threatened.

  

  (h) No  event has occurred and no condition

exceeds respective benefit obligations for such BEandK Benefit Plans as 
determined in accordance with GAAP as of March 30, 2008, or, if there is a
shortfall,  the aggregate value of the unfunded liability for all such BEandK
Benefit Plans with  such a funding shortfall as determined in accordance with
GAAP is approximately  $7,150,000 as of March 30, 2008.

multiemployer plan.

  

  (n) All  employee benefit plans, contracts and
arrangements that are maintained by BEandK and  each ERISA Affiliate that are

Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all
material  patents, patent rights, know-how, trade secrets, trademarks,
trademark rights,  copyrights and other proprietary information and other
proprietary intellectual  property rights used or held for use in connection
with their respective businesses as  currently being conducted (all of which
are listed in _Section 3.15_ of the  BEandK Disclosure Letter, other than "off-
the-shelf" software), and there  are no assertions or claims challenging the
validity of any of the foregoing. BEandK  and its Subsidiaries own or possess
adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all  material software
developed by BEandK or any of its Subsidiaries and used or held for  use in
connection with their respective businesses as currently being conducted (all
of  which are

     
  

listed in  _Section 3.15_ of the BEandK Disclosure Letter, other than  "off-
the-shelf" software), and there are no assertions or claims  challenging the
validity of any of the foregoing. The conduct of BEandK's and  its
Subsidiaries' respective businesses as currently conducted does not 
materially conflict with any patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks,
trademark  rights, trade names, trade name rights or copyrights of others.
There is no material  infringement of any proprietary right owned by or
licensed by or to BEandK or any of  its Subsidiaries.

  

    Section 3.16 _Insurance._

  

  (a) _  Section 3.16_ of the BEandK Disclosure
Letter sets forth a list of all of the  policies of insurance carried as of
the date of this Agreement by BEandK and its  Subsidiaries. All premiums due
and payable under the policies of insurance carried by  BEandK and its
Subsidiaries have been paid in a timely manner.

  

  (b) No  event relating specifically to BEandK
or its Subsidiaries has occurred that could  reasonably be expected, after
the date of this Agreement, to result in an upward  adjustment in premiums
under any insurance policies they maintain. Excluding insurance  policies
that have expired and been replaced in the ordinary course of business, no 
excess liability or protection and indemnity insurance policy has been
canceled by the  insurer within one year prior to the date of this Agreement,
and no threat in writing  has been made to cancel (excluding cancellation
upon expiration or failure to renew)  any such insurance policy of BEandK or
any Subsidiary of BEandK during the period  of one year prior to the date of
this Agreement. Prior to the date of this Agreement,  no event has occurred,
including the failure by BEandK or any Subsidiary of BEandK  to give any notice
or information or by giving any inaccurate or erroneous notice or 
information, that materially limits or impairs the rights of BEandK or any
Subsidiary  of BEandK under any such excess liability or protection and
indemnity insurance  policies. Since January 1, 2006, BEandK and its
Subsidiaries have given notice or  have otherwise presented every claim in
excess of $100,000treated in good faith by  BEandK as covered by insurance
under its insurance policies in a timely fashion, and  _Section 3.16_ of the
BEandK Disclosure Schedule sets forth a listing of all  such notices and
presentations. No claim under any such insurance policy has been  denied or
disputed by the underwriters or issuers thereof.

BEandK PandM Contract is in full force and  effect, and BEandK and each of its
Subsidiaries have in all material respects  performed all obligations
required to be performed by them to date under each BEandK  PandM Contract to
which they are party. Neither BEandK nor any of its Subsidiaries  (x) knows of,
or has received written notice of, any material default under (nor, to  the

or a Subsidiary of BEandK  in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to creditors' rights  and general principles of equity, except where
such unenforceability does not  constitute, individually or in the aggregate,
a BEandK Material Adverse Effect. A  true and complete copy of the latest
project status reports produced prior to April 30,  2008 by BEandK and its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business with respect  to the projects
subject to the Project Contracts have been provided to KBR.

bound or affected; or (iii) subject to the filings  and other matters
referred to in _Section 4.4(b)_ , contravene or conflict with or  constitute
a violation of any provision of any law, rule, regulation, judgment, order 
or decree binding upon or applicable to KBR or any of its Subsidiaries, except
as, in  the case of matters described in clause (ii) or (iii), individually

any of the Parties to obtain any consent, authorization, order or  approval
of any Governmental Agency or the expiration of any applicable waiting

    Section 5.3 _Exclusivity._

  

  (a) Except  as specifically contemplated by
_Section 5.14_ , BEandK agrees that neither it  nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of the officers and directors of it or its  Subsidiaries shall, and that
it shall cause its and such Subsidiaries' employees,  agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant 
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly,
(i)  initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any
inquiry, proposal  or offer with respect to, or a transaction to effect, a
merger, reorganization, share  exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction  involving BEandK or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any sale of 20% or more of the assets  (including stock of
any of its Subsidiaries) of BEandK and any of its Subsidiaries,  or any
purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its equity securities 
that, if consummated, would result in any person (or the stockholders of such
person)  beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, securities representing
20% or more of the  voting equity securities of BEandK or any of its
Subsidiaries (any such inquiry,  proposal, offer or transaction, an "
**Acquisition Proposal** "), (ii)  have any discussion with or provide or
cause to be provided any non-public information  to any Person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or engage or participate in any  negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend,  or
propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or
(iv)  approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, endorse
or recommend, or  execute or enter into, any letter of intent, option
agreement, agreement in principle,  merger agreement, acquisition agreement
or other similar agreement or agree to do any  of the foregoing related to
any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing,  it is understood
that any violation of this _Section 5.3_ by any Subsidiary of  BEandK or
representatives of BEandK or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to  be a
breach of this _Section 5.3_ by BEandK.

  

  (b) Notwithstanding  anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to obtaining the BEandK Stockholder  Approval,
BEandK or its board of directors may (i) engage or participate in  negotiations
or discussions with, or provide or cause to be provided any information  to,
any Person in response to an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not
result  from a breach of paragraph (a) above if (A) BEandK's board of
directors  concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial  advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to lead to  a Superior Proposal (as defined below)
and (B) prior to providing any non-public  information to any Person in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such  Person, BEandK receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement having  provisions
that are no less restrictive than those of the Confidentiality Agreement (it 
being understood that BEandK may enter into a confidentiality agreement without
a  standstill provision or with a standstill provision less favorable to
BEandK  if

     
  

it waives or  similarly modifies the standstill provision in the
Confidentiality Agreement);  _provided_ that BEandK shall promptly provide or
make available to KBR any  material non-public information concerning BEandK or
any of its Subsidiaries that is  provided to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal or such Person's  representatives that was not
previously provided or made available to KBR or its  representatives, (ii)
fail to make, withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to  withdraw,
modify or qualify) the BEandK Board Recommendation or approve or recommend  (or
publicly propose to approve or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal or letter
of  intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar
agreement providing  for any Acquisition Proposal (a " **Change in
Recommendation** ") if (A)  BEandK's board of directors concludes in good
faith, after consultation with  its outside counsel and financial advisors,
that a Change in Recommendation is  necessary in order to comply with its
fiduciary obligations or (B) BEandK has  received an unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal and its board of directors concludes in  good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and its  board of
directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel  and financial advisors, that a Change in Recommendation is necessary
in order to comply  with its fiduciary obligations; _provided, however,_ that
no Change in  Recommendation may be made until (x) the fifth Business Day
following KBR's  receipt of written notice (a " **Notice of Intended Change
in  Recommendation** ") from BEandK advising KBR that BEandK's board of 
directors intends to make a Change in Recommendation and specifying the
material terms  and conditions of the Superior Proposal, if any, that is
related to such Change in  Recommendation and the identity of the party
making such proposal (it being understood  and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of any  such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Intended Change in Recommendation  and a new
five Business Day period) or, if the intended Change in Recommendation does 
not relate to a Superior Proposal, a general description of the material
events giving  rise thereto and (y) if there is a Superior Proposal, BEandK's
board of  directors has approved or concurrently approves a definitive
agreement in respect of  such proposal and terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.3(b)_ and  otherwise complies with _Section 5.6_ and the other
provisions of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, disclosure by BEandK of  any Acquisition Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall  not be deemed to be a
Change in Recommendation. " **Superior Proposal** "  means an Acquisition
Proposal that BEandK's board of directors determines, in  good faith and after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors, is  reasonably
capable of being completed, is, in the good faith judgment of  BEandK's board
of directors, reasonably capable of being fully financed and is  more
favorable to the BEandK Stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders) than 
the transactions provided for in this Agreement, taking into account, among
other  things, the likelihood and timing of consummation, any proposal or
offer by KBR to  amend the terms of this Agreement and the Merger during the
applicable time periods  specified above and such other factors deemed
relevant by BEandK's board of  directors; _provided_ that for purposes of the
definition of "Superior  Proposal", the references in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal"  to "20%" shall be deemed to be "50%".

  

  (c) BEandK  shall notify KBR as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after  receipt) in writing of
any inquiries, proposals or offers related to an Acquisition  Proposal that
are received by, any confidential information or data that is requested 
from, or any negotiations or discussions related to an Acquisition Proposal
that are  sought to be initiated or continued with BEandK or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of  their representatives, keep KBR promptly informed of
any changes thereto; each  such notice shall

     
  

include the  identity of all Persons involved in such matters.

  

  (d) BEandK  and its Subsidiaries and each of
their respective representatives immediately shall  cease and cause to be
terminated all activities, discussions and negotiations existing  as of the
date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and, to the 
extent permitted by the applicable confidentiality or similar agreement
governing such  activities, discussions or negotiations, require any third
parties (other than KBR) to  such activities, discussions or negotiations to
return to BEandK or to destroy all  confidential information of BEandK or any of
its Subsidiaries.

  

    Section 5.4 _Employee Matters._

  

  (a) The  Parties agree that all employees of
the BEandK and its ERISA Affiliates immediately  prior to the Effective Time
shall be employed by the Surviving Company immediately  after the Effective
Time, it being understood that KBR and the Surviving Company shall,  except
as required by Applicable Law, have no obligations to continue employing
such  employees for any length of time thereafter except pursuant to any
agreements that are  specifically disclosed in _Section 5.4_ of the BEandK
Disclosure Schedule and  identified therein as providing such an exception.

  

  (b) KBR  shall deem, and shall cause the
Surviving Company to deem, the period of employment  with BEandK and its ERISA
Affiliates to have been employment and service with KBR and  the Surviving
Company for benefit plan eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for 
purposes of benefit accruals or benefit computations) for all of KBR's and
the  Surviving Company's employee benefit plans, programs, policies or
arrangements to  the extent service with KBR or the Surviving Company is
recognized under any such plan,  program, policy or arrangement.

  

  (c) The  Parties further agree that from and
after the Effective Time, employees of the  Surviving Company shall continue
to be covered under the BEandK Benefit Plans and  shall not, regardless of any
provisions of (i) the BEandK Benefit Plans or (ii) the  "employee benefit
plans" (as defined under Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are  maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by KBR or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries 
(other than the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries) (the " **KBR  Plans**
"), be entitled to any benefits under the KBR Plans until such time as  the
KBR Plans are specifically amended after the Effective Time to provide for
such  coverage. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the Surviving Company
or KBR to  continue to provide benefits under any such BEandK Plans or KBR
Plans.

  

  (d) No  employee of KBR, BEandK or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is intended to be a  third-party beneficiary of the
provisions of this _Section 5.4_.

  

  (e) Notwithstanding  any other provision of
this Agreement, KBR and BEandK shall maintain the BEandK  Retirement Plan (either
as a frozen plan or an active plan, as determined in the sole  discretion of
KBR) in effect until such time as the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Excluded 
Escrow Fund and the Expense Escrow Fund have been terminated and disbursed
in  full.

     
  

    Section 5.5 _Inspection._

  

  (a) From  the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, BEandK shall allow designated  officers, attorneys, accountants
and other representatives of KBR, in each case as  designated by KBR,
reasonable access, at all reasonable times, upon reasonable notice,  to the
personnel, records and files, correspondence, audits and properties, as well
as  to all information relating to commitments, contracts, titles and
financial position,  or otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs of
BEandK and its Subsidiaries,  including inspection of such properties;
_provided_ that no investigation pursuant  to this _Section 5.5_ shall affect
any representation or warranty given by  BEandK hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, BEandK shall not be required to  provide any information that (i) it
reasonably believes it may not provide to KBR by  reason of Applicable Laws
or (ii) constitutes information protected by attorney/client  privilege. The
Parties shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure 
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence  apply. All non-public information obtained pursuant to this
_Section 5.5_ shall be  governed by the Confidentiality Agreement dated
January 9, 2008 between KBR and  BEandK (the " **Confidentiality Agreement**
").

  

  (b) BEandK  shall promptly provide to KBR a
true and complete copy of each of the project status  reports produced on or
after April 30, 2008 by BEandK and its Subsidiaries in the  ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice, with respect to the  projects that
are the subject of the Project Contracts. BEandK shall provide notice  in
writing to one of the representatives of KBR designated in _Section 5.5_ of
the  KBR Disclosure Letter of the intention of BEandK or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter  into prior to the Closing any Project Contract
referenced in either clause (i) or (ii)  of _Section 3.17(a)_ ; each such
notice shall be provided at the same time that  such proposed Project
Contract is submitted to BEandK's chief executive officer  for his approval.

  

    Section 5.6 _Fees and Expenses._

  

  (a) BEandK  shall pay to KBR a fee of
$16,500,000 if: (i) BEandK terminates this Agreement  pursuant to _Section
7.3(b)_ ; (ii) KBR terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.4(c)_ ;
or (iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section  7.2(a)_ ,
_Section 7.2(c)_ , _Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.4(b)_ and  prior to such
termination, any Person makes an Acquisition Proposal, which has not been 
withdrawn (x) in the case of any termination following a failure to obtain the
BEandK  Stockholder Approval, at least 10 Business Days prior to any
stockholder meeting and  (y) in the case of any termination pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)_ at least 30 days  prior to the Termination Date, and (B) at
or within 12 months after the date of the  termination, BEandK enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate, or consummates,  the transactions
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal. Any fee due under this  _Section
5.6(a)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the date of 
termination of this Agreement (except that in the case of termination pursuant
to  clause (iii) above such payment shall be made on the earlier of the date
of the  consummation of such Acquisition Proposal or the date of execution of
such definitive  agreement) and shall be subject to a credit for any expense
reimbursement actually paid  pursuant to _Section 5.6(b)_.

     
  

  (b) BEandK  shall reimburse KBR and Merger Sub
for all their out-of-pocket expenses actually  incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement, up to a limit of $4,000,000, if this Agreement is  terminated
pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_ (and prior to the stockholder meeting at  which
the BEandK Stockholder Approval was not obtained relating to such termination, 
any Person has made an Acquisition Proposal that was not withdrawn at least 10
Business  Days prior to such stockholder meeting). Such reimbursement shall
be paid upon demand  following such termination, except that no payment shall
be due under this _Section  5.6(b)_ if BEandK has previously made any payment
due under _Section  5.6(a)_.

  

    Section 5.7 _Certain Accounts;  Guarantees._

  

  (a) Prior  to or at the Closing, BEandK shall,
and shall cause BEandK and its Subsidiaries to,  settle, repay or cancel (or
make provisions for settlement or repayment from the Merger  Consideration to
be received by the applicable BEandK Stockholders) all accounts that  are
unpaid (with money owing to or by BEandK or any of its Subsidiaries) as of the 
Closing Date between (i) BEandK or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and (ii)
any of  the BEandK Stockholders and their Affiliates (other than BEandK and its 
Subsidiaries), on the other hand (which, for purposes of clarity, shall
include Baltix  Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and PBR Hotel, Ltd., an
Alabama limited  partnership). For purposes of clarity, BEandK shall cause each
of it and its  Subsidiaries not to have, as of the Closing, any obligations
or liabilities with  respect to Baltix Corporation, a Delaware corporation,
and PBR Hotel, Ltd., an Alabama  limited partnership, including under the
loan agreement referenced in Item 7 of  _Section 3.8(b)_ of the BEandK

Subsidiaries has an ownership interest.

reasonable request in connection with any arrangements proposed by KBR to 
replace as of or after the Effective Time any bank credit agreements,
guarantees or  surety bonds or related indemnity agreements currently
maintained by BEandK or its  Subsidiaries. BEandK and its Subsidiaries shall
cooperate with KBR and provide KBR  with such information regarding BEandK and
its Subsidiaries, and make available such  personnel, as KBR may reasonably
request in order to assist KBR in connection with any  existing or proposed
credit agreements of KBR or any of its Subsidiaries and any  amendments to
any such agreements. In furtherance thereof, and without limiting the 
foregoing, KBR shall be entitled to provide such information to the banks
involved with  such credit agreements and their respective attorneys and
other  representatives.

  

    Section 5.9 _D andO Matters._

  

  (a) KBR  and Merger Sub agree that all rights
to indemnification and exculpation from  liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now  existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers currently indemnified  by BEandK and
its Subsidiaries (each an " **Indemnified Person** ")  as

     
  

provided in  their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws (or
comparable organizational  documents) or other agreements providing
indemnification shall survive the Merger and,  subject to Applicable Law,
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with  their terms.

  

  (b) KBR  shall cause to be maintained for a
period of not less than six years from the Effective  Time either (i) BEandK's
current directors' and officers' insurance  and indemnification policy to the
extent that it provides coverage for events occurring  prior to the Effective
Time (the " **D andO Insurance**") for  Indemnified Persons on the date of this
Agreement, so long as the annual premium  therefor would not be in excess of
200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the  date of this Agreement
(such 200% amount, the " **Maximum Premium** ") or  (ii) DandO Insurance with
an insurer substantially comparable, to the insurer under  the DandO Insurance
provided to Indemnified Persons as of the date of this Agreement,  of at
least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions no
less  advantageous to the Indemnified Persons; provided that the annualized
premium for such  DandO Insurance does not exceed the Maximum Premium, in which
case, KBR will obtain  the most favorable DandO Insurance available for the
Maximum Premium. If the existing  DandO Insurance expires, is terminated or
canceled during such six-year period, KBR  shall use all reasonable efforts
to cause to be obtained as much DandO Insurance as  can be obtained for the
remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in  excess of the
Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the 
existing DandO Insurance. BEandK represents to KBR that the Maximum Premium is 
$252,000.

  

    Section 5.10 _Stockholder Litigation_.  BEandK shall give
KBR, at KBR's expense, the opportunity to participate in the  defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against BEandK and/or its  directors
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such 
settlement shall be agreed to without KBR's prior written consent, which
consent  shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

    Section 5.11 _Publicity_. Each of KBR and  BEandK shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or similar  public
announcement pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated 
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement  without the prior consent of the other Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably  withheld, delayed or conditioned, except as may be
required by Applicable Laws or by  obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange, in  which case the Party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public  announcement shall
use its all reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the  other Party
before issuing any such press releases or making any such public 
announcements.

  

    Section 5.12 _Notification_. Each Party  shall give to
the others prompt notice of (i) any representation or warranty made by it  or
contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect  and (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any  covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this  Agreement; _provided, however_ , that, except as
expressly provided in _Section  5.13_ , no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants  or agreements of the Parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under  this Agreement.

     
  

    Section 5.13 _Updates to Disclosure  Letters_. Without
limiting the generality of _Section 5.12_ , BEandK and KBR  each shall provide
to the other written updates to its respective Disclosure Letter  promptly
upon becoming aware of facts or circumstances that would cause any of its 
representations or warranties in _Articles 3_ or _4_ , respectively, to be 
untrue or incomplete in any material respect. Neither BEandK nor KBR may use the
fact  that it has provided updates to its Disclosure Letter (or the contents
of such updates)  as a basis for asserting that any of the closing conditions
in _Sections 6.2(b)_   and _6.2(c)_ (with respect to updates provided by KBR)
or _Sections 6.3(b)_ ,  _6.3(c)_ or _6.3(g)_ (with respect to updates
provided by BEandK) have been  satisfied. If BEandK has provided updates to the
BEandK Disclosure Letter prior to  the Closing Date that establish that any of
the closing conditions in _Sections  6.3(b)_ , _6.3(c)_ or _6.3(g)_ have not
been satisfied and KBR elects to  waive such closing conditions and to
proceed with Closing, then KBR shall be precluded  after the Closing from
using the contents of such updates as a basis for asserting a  Claim for
indemnification under _Article 8_ ; in all other circumstances, such  updates
from BEandK shall have no impact under this Agreement. Notwithstanding any of 
the foregoing, if Closing would otherwise occur at a time within three
Business Days of  the last update provided by BEandK under this _Section 5.13_
, KBR shall have the  unilateral right to extend Closing by not more than
three Business Days after the date  on which KBR last receives any such
update, and, if such extension would cause Closing  to occur after the
Termination Date, to extend the Termination Date by an equal amount  of time.

  

    Section 5.14 _Certain Actions Associated  with
Closing_. Prior to the Closing, notwithstanding any other provision in this 
Agreement, BEandK shall take the actions contemplated by _Section 5.14_ of the 
BEandK Disclosure Letter, in each case in accordance and compliance with, and 
otherwise subject to, any applicable rights of first offer, rights of first
refusal,  consent or approval rights, notice provisions and any similar
obligation or right of  any Governmental Agency or any Person. In connection
with the cash proceeds from the  sale of assets of North Star Communications
Group, Inc. (" **North  Star** ") as contemplated in _Section 5.14_ of the
BEandK Disclosure  Letter (the " **North Star Sale** "), BEandK shall take all
actions  necessary so that such cash proceeds are first used to pay all Taxes
associated with  such sale not taken into account in the determination of
Expected Adjusted  Stockholders' Equity, Closing Adjusted Stockholders'
Equity or Final  Adjusted Stockholders' Equity, as the case may be, then to
pay all accounts  payable and other obligations of North Star and its
Subsidiaries to third-parties  arising at any time at or prior to the closing
of the North Star Sale, and then to pay  all intercompany debt obligations of
North Star and its Subsidiaries to BEandK or any  of its other Subsidiaries in
existence as of the closing of the North Star Sale  (collectively, the "
**North Star Payment Obligations** "). If after the  pay-off of all North
Star Payment Obligations there remains net cash proceeds from the  North Star
Sale, then (i) if Closing has not yet occurred, the remaining cash proceeds 
may be distributed for the benefit of the BEandK Stockholders as a portion of
the  dividend contemplated by _Section 5.1_ of the BEandK Disclosure Letter and
(ii)  if Closing has already occurred, KBR shall cause a dollar amount equal
to such  remaining cash proceeds to be deposited with the Paying Agent and
disbursed by the  Paying Agent to the BEandK Stockholders as Merger
Consideration in accordance with  _Section 2.7(b)_.

  

    Section 5.15 _Approval  by Holders of BE andK Class A
Common Stock_.

  

  (a) BEandK  shall take all lawful action and
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, within  six days of the date
this Agreement was approved and adopted by the board of directors  of BEandK, a
written

     
  

consent in lieu  of a meeting of at least the number of the holders of BEandK
Class A Common Stock  that is sufficient to adopt this Agreement in
accordance with § 228 of the DGCL  and BEandK's certificate of incorporation
and bylaws.

  

  (b) Unless  adoption of this Agreement
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this _Section 5.15_ has  occurred, BEandK, acting
through its board of directors, shall take, in accordance  with Applicable
Law and BEandK's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all  reasonable
action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of 
holders of BEandK Class A Common Stock as promptly as reasonably practicable
after  the execution of this Agreement to consider and vote upon the approval
of this  Agreement. Subject to _Section 5.3_ , the board of directors of BEandK
shall  recommend such approval and shall take all reasonable lawful action to
solicit such  adoption of this Agreement. BEandK shall keep KBR updated with
respect to the proxy  solicitation results as reasonably required by KBR.

  

    Section 5.16 _BE andK Preferred  Stock_. At or prior to
the Closing, BEandK shall redeem all of the issued and  outstanding shares of
BEandK Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price equal to  $1,000 per
share plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of redemption, and 
otherwise on terms reasonably acceptable to KBR.

  

    Section 5.17 _Notices and Consents_.  KBR and BEandK
shall, and BEandK shall cause its Subsidiaries to, give all required  notices
to those third parties, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
those  third party consents, that are necessary, proper or advisable in
connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
under all guaranty or surety  bonds and related indemnity agreements,
including Item 6 in _Section 3.6(b)_ , Item  2 in _Section 3.7(a)_ and Items
4 and 5 in _Section 3.7(b)_ of the BEandK  Disclosure Letter.

  

    Section 5.18 _Certain Insurance  Matters_. After
Closing, KBR shall cause BEandK and its Subsidiaries not to cancel  the "errors
and omissions" insurance coverage maintained by BEandK and  its Subsidiaries as
of the date of this Agreement; it being understood, however, that  none of
KBR, BEandK or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be under any 
obligation to maintain or otherwise cause to exist any such insurance coverage
(or  similar coverage) beyond the current term of such insurance coverage
existing as of the  date of this Agreement.

  (b) No  claim for Damages or other relief of any
kind (including a claim under _Section  8.2(a)_ ) arising out of or relating

this Agreement may be brought by KBR unless a written  notice describing the
nature of the claim, the theory of liability or the nature of the  relief
sought and the material factual assertions upon which the claim is based is 
given to the Stockholders' Representatives as contemplated by _Section 2.4_  
before the termination of the applicable Survival Period. Notwithstanding
anything  herein to the contrary, any representation, warranty, covenant or

claim for Damages with respect to  which such notice is given pursuant to
this Agreement prior to the end of the Survival  Period, until the matter is
finally resolved and any related Damages are  paid.

such  Damages shall be deemed to include any Tax costs and other adverse
Tax  impacts from the sale or disposition of any of the Excluded Businesses
that  have not been taken into account in the Expected Adjusted 
Stockholders' Equity, the Closing Adjusted Stockholders' Equity  or the Final
Adjusted Stockholders' Equity, as the case may be),  notwithstanding any
disclosures set forth in the BEandK Disclosure  Letter, except as expressly set
forth in _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ ;  _provided_ , that no Damages associated
with Rintekno shall be deemed  to exist for purposes of this clause (iii)
with respect to those amounts of  cash that are properly paid from the escrow
fund established pursuant to  the Escrow Agreement 2, dated February 29, 2008
between BEandK and Neste  Jacobs Oy (the " **Rintekno Escrow** "); and
_provided,  further_ , that no Damages associated with North Star and the
North Star  Sale shall be deemed to exist for purposes of this clause (iii)
with  respect to those amounts of cash that are properly paid from the
escrow  fund established pursuant to the escrow agreement referenced in
_Schedule  5.14_ of

---|--- 
      



     |  

the  BEandK Disclosure Letter associated with the North Star Sale (the  "
**North Star Escrow** ").

    
    

  (b) The  foregoing obligation to the KBR
Indemnified Parties set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_   shall be subject to each
of the following qualifications and limitations:

        



     |  



    
---|--- 
      



     |  

  (i) No  reimbursement or payment for any
Damages asserted against by the KBR  Indemnified Parties under _Section
8.2(a)(ii)_ (other than in  connection with the representations and
warranties contained in _Sections  3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.5_ and
_3.26_ ,  which shall not be subject to any of the limits in this clause
(i),  including, except with respect to the representations and warranties
set  forth in _Sections 3.1_ and _3.5_ as to the qualifications or  licenses
of BEandK or its Subsidiaries in jurisdictions other than their  jurisdictions
of incorporation or organization, the proviso contained  herein) shall be
required unless and until the cumulative aggregate amount  of such Damages
equals or exceeds $2,750,000 (the " **Indemnification  Threshold** "), in
which case the KBR Indemnified Parties shall be  entitled to the aggregate
amount of all Damages in excess of the  Indemnification Threshold; provided
that any Damages that individually  (which, for this purpose, shall be
combined with all Damages based upon the  same or substantially related set
of facts) total less than or equal to  $100,000 (" **De Minimis Losses** ")
shall be excluded in  their entirety and the KBR Indemnified Parties shall
not be indemnified for  any such De Minimis Losses (however, for purposes of
clarity, with respect  to any Damages in excess of $100,000, there shall be
no deduction from such  amount of Damages associated with any such $100,000
De Minimis  Loss).

    
      



     |  



    
      



     |  

  (ii) For  all determinations made after
the Closing regarding the existence of a  breach of any of BEandK's
representations and warranties in  _Article 3_ for the purposes of _Section
8.2(a)(ii)_ or the  amount of any Damages with respect thereto, all such
representations and  warranties that are qualified by materiality or by
reference to BEandK  Material Adverse Effect (other than the representations
and warranties  contained in _Section 3.26)_ shall be deemed to be not so 
qualified.

    
      



     |  



    
      



     |  

  (iii) Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the aggregate amount  of Damages and
the source of payment thereof for which the KBR Indemnified  Parties shall be
entitled to indemnification (A) under _Sections  8.2(a)(i)_ and _8.2(a)(ii_ )
shall be limited to the Indemnity  Escrow Fund and (B) under _Section
8.2(a)(iii)_ shall be limited to  the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Excluded
Business Escrow Fund, the North  Star Escrow and the Rintekno Escrow; it
being understood that no amounts  may be paid from either the Excluded
Business Escrow Fund or the Indemnity  Escrow Fund with respect to Claims
arising from claims made under the  Rintekno Purchase Agreement or the
purchase agreement to be executed in  connection with the North Star Sale (as
such agreement is described in  _Section 5.14_ of the BEandK Disclosure Letter)
until all amounts in  the Rintekno Escrow or the North Star Escrow, as
applicable, have been paid  out in accordance with their terms, provided such
claims may be paid from  the Rintekno Escrow or the North Star Escrow, as
applicable, in accordance  with their terms.

    
       
        



     |  



    
---|--- 
      



     |  

  (iv) If  applicable, the right to make a
claim for Damages is subject to the terms  and conditions of the potential
limitation set forth in _Section  5.13_.

    
    

  (c) The  indemnities provided in this
_Section 8.2_ shall survive the Closing. After  Closing, the indemnity
provided in this _Section 8.2_ shall be the sole and  exclusive remedy of the
KBR Indemnified Parties at law or in equity under this  Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including for any breach of any of  the
certifications, representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this 
Agreement or in any certificates delivered pursuant to _Section 6.3(c)._ All 
claims by any KBR Indemnified Parties for Damages under this _Section 8.2_
shall  be made only against, and shall be limited to, the Indemnity Escrow
Fund and the  Excluded Business Escrow Fund as contemplated by _Section 2.5_
and, also with  respect to Damages arising under _Section 8.2(a)(iii),_ the
North Star Escrow and  the Rintekno Escrow. The Parties agree to treat any
indemnity payment made pursuant to  this _Section 8.2_ as an adjustment to
the Final Purchase Price unless otherwise  required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section  1313(a) of the Code.

  

  (d) Prior  to the Closing, if any of the
conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ or _6.3_   shall have become incapable
of fulfillment and shall not have been waived by KBR, then  KBR shall have
the remedy provided to it in _Section 7.4_ , in addition to such  other
remedies as may be available to it under Applicable Law.

  

  (e) After  the Closing, if KBR discovers any
breach by BEandK in any of its covenants that  occurred prior to the Closing or
inaccuracy in any of BEandK's representations  or warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered hereunder,  and, provided KBR makes
a Claim Notice for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement  within the
Survival Period, then KBR shall be indemnified by way of the Indemnity 
Escrow Fund and the Excluded Business Escrow Fund from and against all Damages
(subject  to the limitations contained in this _Article 8_ ) arising out of
or resulting from  such breach or inaccuracy, and, also with respect to
Damages arising under _Section  8.2(a)(iii),_ the North Star Escrow and the
Rintekno Escrow. Each Claim Notice of  KBR shall be sent in accordance with
the notice provisions of this Agreement or the  Escrow Agreement, as
applicable.

  

  (f) KBR  shall notify the Stockholders'
Representatives promptly upon receipt of any claim  asserted by a third party
against any KBR Indemnified Party (including, after the  Closing, BEandK or its
Subsidiaries and including claims by the purchasers under the  purchase
agreements relating to the disposition of Rintekno and the North Star Sale)
(a  " **Third Party Claim** ") that are reasonably likely to give rise to a 
claim by KBR under this _Section 8.2._ The Stockholders' Representatives 
shall have the right to participate in, but not control, any such defense
through their  own counsel, and the fees and expenses of such counsel and
other expenses the  Stockholders' Representatives subsequently incur in
connection with such defense  shall be borne by the Stockholders'
Representatives; the Stockholders'  Representatives shall be entitled to draw
on the Expense Escrow Fund for the payment or  reimbursement of such fees and
expenses. KBR shall keep the Stockholders'  Representatives reasonably
informed of all material developments regarding the  resolution of any such
Third Party Claims. KBR shall not settle (i) a Third Party Claim  that is
reasonably likely to give rise to a claim by KBR under this _Section 8.2_  
or (ii) a claim against the Rintekno Escrow or the North Star Escrow, without,
in each  case, the consent of the Stockholders' Representatives, unless such
consent is  unreasonably withheld.

     
  

    Section 8.3 _Tax Contest_.  Notwithstanding any
provision in _Section 8.2_ , following the Closing Date, KBR  shall have the
sole right to conduct any Tax audit or other Tax contest relating to  BEandK
and any of its Subsidiaries; _provided, however,_ that to the extent that 
there is a claim relating to Taxes that is subject to indemnification in
accordance  with this _Article 8_ , KBR shall (i) give notice to the
Stockholders'  Representatives of such claims that are reasonably likely to
result in Damages, (ii)  allow the Stockholders' Representatives, acting as a
single group, to comment on  such matters and provide to the Stockholders'
Representatives information  reasonably requested by such Stockholders'
Representatives, acting as a single  group, and permit the Support
Stockholder, acting as a single group, to evaluate such  claim, and (iii) to
the extent comments from the Stockholders' Representatives  are received,
reasonably and in good faith consider such comments.

  

    Section 8.4 _Other Indemnification  Matters_. The
amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this 
_Article 8_ shall be computed net of (a) any reserves specifically relating to
the  Damages, where such reserves are set forth in the balance sheets used in
determining  the Closing Adjusted Stockholders' Equity, and (b) any insurance
or other  proceeds received by the KBR Indemnified Parties in connection with
such  Damages.

  

    Section 8.5 _Reliance_. KBR  acknowledges that neither
BEandK nor any BEandK Stockholder has made any  representation or warranty,
expressed or implied, or as to the accuracy or completeness  of any
information furnished or made available to KBR and its representatives,
except  as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the agreements,
certificates or instruments  delivered in connection with this Agreement,
and, except as set forth in this Agreement  or the agreements, certificates
or instruments delivered in connection with this  Agreement, neither any BEandK
Stockholder nor BEandK shall have or be subject to  any liability to KBR or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to KBR, or  KBR's use of or
reliance on, any such information or any information, documents  or material
made available to KBR in any "data rooms", management  presentations or in
any other form in expectation of or in connection with, the  transactions
contemplated hereby.

    Section 9.2 _Assignment; Binding Effect;  Benefit_.
Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations 
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of law
or  otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties.
Notwithstanding the  foregoing, Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights,  interests and obligations under this
Agreement to KBR or to any direct or indirect  wholly owned Subsidiary of
KBR. Subject to the forgoing, this Agreement shall be  binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and  their
respective successors and assigns. Except as provided _Section 5.9_ ,
nothing  in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on
any Person other than  the Parties or their respective successors and assigns
any rights, remedies,  obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than the  BEandK Stockholders (and their heirs and personal
representatives), who shall be  deemed third party beneficiaries of this
Agreement after the Effective Time to the  extent of their rights to receive
payments under _Article 2_ and under the Escrow  Agreement. The Stockholders'

     
  

Representatives,  and only the Stockholders' Representatives, shall be
entitled to bring an action  and make a claim against KBR for any breach by
KBR of _Section 5.4_.

  

    Section 9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This  Agreement, the
exhibits to this Agreement, the BEandK Disclosure Letter, the KBR  Disclosure
Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Support Agreement constitute 
the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and  supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the  Parties with respect thereto. The BEandK Disclosure
Letter, the KBR Disclosure Letter  and all exhibits attached hereto and
referred to herein are hereby incorporated herein  and made a part hereof for
all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

  

    Section 9.4 _Amendments_. This Agreement  may be
amended by the Parties. To be effective, any amendment or modification
hereto  must be in a written document each Party has executed and delivered
to the other  Parties.

  

    Section 9.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement  and the
rights and obligations of the Parties shall be governed by and construed and 
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard
to the  conflicts of law provisions thereof that would cause the laws of any
other jurisdiction  to apply.

  

    Section 9.6 _Counterparts_ This Agreement  may be
executed by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed  and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall
together constitute  one and the same instrument. Each counterpart may
consist of a number of copies hereof  each signed by less than all, but
together signed by all of the Parties.

  

    Section 9.7 _Headings_. Headings of the  Articles and
Sections of this Agreement are for the convenience of the Parties only and 
shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect whatsoever.

Agreement, (a) words in the singular shall be deemed to include the plural

gender as the  context requires, (b) the terms "hereof", "herein", 
"herewith" and "hereunder" and words of similar import shall,  unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to  any particular provision of this Agreement and (c) the words "include", 
"includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by  the words
"without limitation". This Agreement shall be construed without  regard to
any presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the 
Party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted.

  

    Section 9.9 _Certain Definitions_. In this  Agreement:

  

  (a) The  phrase " **to the knowledge of** "
and similar phrases relating to  knowledge of BEandK shall mean the collective
knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, of  the individuals listed in _Section
9.9_ of the BEandK Disclosure  Letter.

     
  

  (b) " **  Affiliate** " of a Person means any
other Person that directly or indirectly,  through one or more
intermediaries, Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common  Control with,
the first mentioned Person.

  

  (c) " **  Business Day** " means a day other
than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which  banks located in the State of
Texas or the State of Alabama are authorized or required  by Applicable Laws
to close.

  

  (d) " **  Control** " and its derivative
expressions means the possession, directly or  indirectly, of the power to
direct or cause the direction of the management and  policies of a Person,
whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract  or
otherwise.

  

  (e) " **  Material Adverse Effect** " means,
with respect to any Party, any change,  effect, event, occurrence, state of
facts or development that individually or in the  aggregate has a material
adverse effect on or change in (i) the business, assets,  prospects,
financial condition or results of operations of such Party and its 
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except for any such change or effect that
arises or  results from (A) changes in general economic, capital market,
regulatory or political  conditions or changes in law or the interpretation
thereof that, in any case, do not  disproportionately affect such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries in any material  respect, (B) changes that affect
generally the industries in which such Party and its  Subsidiaries are
engaged and do not disproportionately affect such Party or any of its 
Subsidiaries in any material respect, (C) acts of war or terrorism that do
not  disproportionately affect such Party in any material respect or (ii) the
ability of the  Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or to fulfill the  conditions to Closing.

defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended).

  

  (g) The  term " **Subsidiary** ," when used
with respect to any Party, means any  corporation or other organization
(including a limited liability company or a  partnership), whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which such Party directly or  indirectly
owns or controls at least 50% of the securities or other interests having by 
their terms ordinary voting power to elect at least 50% of the board of
directors or  others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other  organization or any organization of which such Party is
a general partner or managing  partner.

  

    Section 9.10 _Waivers_. Except as provided in this 
Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by  or on behalf of any Party, or delay or omission in the
exercise of any right, power or  remedy accruing to any Party as a result of
any breach or default hereunder by any  other Party shall be deemed to impair
any such right, power or remedy, nor shall it be  deemed to constitute a
waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any 
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The  waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision hereunder
shall not operate or be  construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent
breach of the same or any other  provision hereunder.

     
  

    Section 9.11 _Severability_. If any provision of  this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision shall, to the 
extent possible, be modified in such a manner as to be valid, legal and
enforceable but  so as to retain most nearly the intent of the Parties as
expressed herein, and if such  a modification is not possible, that provision
shall be severed from this Agreement,  and in either case the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining  provisions of this Agreement
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. If  any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall  be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  

    Section 9.12 _Further Assurances_. Upon request  from
time to time, the Parties shall execute or cause to be executed and delivered
such  other documents and instruments and shall do such other acts that may
be reasonably  necessary or desirable to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to carry  out the intent of this Agreement.

  

    Section 9.13 _Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction  and
Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial._

  

  (a) The  Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the  provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms  or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled  to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law to an injunction or injunctions
to  prevent or restrain breaches, violations, defaults or threatened
breaches, violations  or defaults of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of  this Agreement in the Court of
Chancery of Delaware in the State of Delaware, this  being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.  In addition,
each of the Parties (i) consents to submit itself to the personal 
jurisdiction of the state court located in the State of Delaware, and that the
Court of  Chancery shall be the exclusive jurisdiction in the event any
dispute arises out of  this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat  such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and  (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or the Merger  in any court other

Parties agrees that a final non-appealable judgment in any action or

suit on  the judgment or in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

  

  (b) **  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS  AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT  HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
