Director Emeritus, the occurrence of any event which in the case of a director would create a
vacancy on the Board, shall be deemed to create a vacancy in such position; but the Board may
declare the position terminated until such time as the Board shall again deem it proper to create
and to fill the position. A Director Emeritus shall be entitled to indemnification under these
Bylaws to the same extent, and subject to the same conditions and limitations, as a member of the

be deemed to be a contract between the corporation and each director, officer, employee and agent
who serves in such capacity at any time while these provisions as well as the relevant provisions
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware are in effect and any repeal or
modification thereof shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any
state of facts then or previously existing or any action, suit, or proceeding previously or
thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. Such a
&#147;contract right&#148; may not be modified retroactively without the consent of such director, officer,
employee or agent. The indemnification provided by this Section&nbsp;6.10 shall not be deemed exclusive
of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit
of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <U>Indemnification Agreements</U>. Without limiting the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6.10,
the corporation is authorized from time to time, without further action by the stockholders of the
corporation, to enter into agreements with any director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation providing such rights of indemnification as the corporation may deem appropriate, up to
the maximum extent permitted by law. Any agreement entered into by the corporation with a director
may be authorized by the other directors, and such authorization shall not be invalid on the basis
that similar agreements may have been or may thereafter be entered into with other directors.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was
or has agreed to serve at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent

employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise against any liability asserted against, and incurred by, him or her or on his
or her behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the
corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of this Section&nbsp;6.10.

shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of such person,
who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights,
including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the corporation to bring suit to
enforce such rights in accordance with the terms of such insurance policy.

corporation&#148; shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation
(including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its
separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors,
officers, employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director, officer employee or
agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under
the provisions of this Section&nbsp;6.10 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or
she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;6.10, references to &#147;fines&#148; shall include any excise taxes
assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to &#147;serving at the
request of the corporation&#148; shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of
the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in
good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner &#147;not opposed to the best interests of the corporation&#148; as referred to in this Section&nbsp;6.10.
For purposes of any determination under this Section&nbsp;6.10, a person shall be deemed to have acted
in &#147;good faith&#148; and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no
reasonable cause to believe such person&#146;s conduct was unlawful, if such person&#146;s action is based on
the records or books of account of the corporation or another enterprise, or on information
supplied to such person by the officers of the corporation or another enterprise in the course of
their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the corporation or another enterprise or on
information or records given or reports made to the corporation or another enterprise by an
independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable
care by the corporation or another enterprise. The provisions of this Section&nbsp;6.10(i) shall not be
deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to
have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;6.10(a)(3) of this Section&nbsp;6.10,
as the case may be.

settlement of any action, suit or proceeding without the corporation&#146;s prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. The corporation shall not settle any action, suit or proceeding
in any manner that would impose any fine or other obligation on any director or officer or employee

indemnify each director or officer and may indemnify each employee or agent of the corporation as
to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative

such event, the corporation shall contribute to the payment of such director&#146;s or officer&#146;s costs,
charges and expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement
with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, but not including an action by or in the right of the corporation, in an amount that
is just and equitable in the circumstances, taking into account, among other things, contributions
by other directors and officers of the corporation or others pursuant to indemnification agreements
or otherwise; <U>provided</U>, that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such
contribution shall not be required where such holding by the court is due to (i)&nbsp;the failure of
such director or officer to meet the standard of conduct set forth in subsection (a)&nbsp;hereof, or
(ii)&nbsp;any limitation on indemnification set forth in subsection (h)(iii), (j)&nbsp;or (k)&nbsp;hereof.
