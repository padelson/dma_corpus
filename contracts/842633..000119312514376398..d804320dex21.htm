below). The Parties may, at any time, terminate this Agreement by delivering to the Escrow Agent written notice (the &#147;<I>Termination Notice</I>&#148;) signed by the Parties setting forth (i)&nbsp;the requested termination date and
(ii)&nbsp;instructions for payment of the remaining Escrow Funds to the Person or Persons designated in such Termination Notice. The Termination Notice shall be received by the Escrow Agent not fewer than two (2)&nbsp;Business Days prior to the
requested termination date. A form of Termination Notice is attached hereto as <U>Exhibit C</U>. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) Should the Parties terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this <U>Article VI</U>, it is understood and agreed by each of them that the Escrow Agent shall be entitled (i)&nbsp;to keep any monies paid to it (other than monies constituting the Escrow Fund) in respect of fees or expenses
previously due and owing and (ii)&nbsp;to offset from the amount of the Escrow Fund on deposit as of the date of the Termination Notice, any amounts due for fees and expenses that, as of such date, have been previously invoiced and which are then
delinquent due to nonpayment, provided, however, that such amount shall be offset, if and only to the extent possible, from amounts which would otherwise be paid to the Party or Parties responsible for paying the delinquent amounts. For the
avoidance of doubt, if monies would otherwise be paid to a Party upon termination of this Agreement, and such Party is not responsible for the delinquent amounts, then the Escrow Agent shall have no right of setoff against that portion of the Escrow
Fund that would be paid to such Party. The Escrow Agent is authorized to disinvest the remaining Escrow Funds one (1)&nbsp;Business Day prior to the requested date of termination set forth in the Termination Notice, or may do so earlier if the
Escrow Agent determines in its sole good faith discretion that disinvesting more than one (1)&nbsp;Business Day prior to the requested date is necessary in order to assure the availability of funds on the requested termination date. Notwithstanding
any other provision hereof, this Agreement shall not terminate before all amounts in the Escrow Account (including interest which has accrued but cannot be distributed prior to being posted) shall have been distributed by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. </P>

paid under a 12b-1 plan, and do not impact the investment performance of the fund. The amount of any revenue share, if any, payable to the Escrow Agent with respect to your account&#146;s investments is available upon request. </P>

under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended, that you have a right to purchase insurance coverage for losses resulting from acts of terrorism, as defined in Section 102(1) of the Act: The term &#147;act of terrorism&#148; means any act that
is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury&#151;in concurrence with the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General of the United States&#151;to be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property, or
infrastructure; to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals
as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WHERE COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BY THIS POLICY FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM, SUCH LOSSES MAY BE PARTIALLY
REIMBURSED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT UNDER A FORMULA ESTABLISHED BY FEDERAL LAW. HOWEVER, YOUR POLICY MAY CONTAIN OTHER EXCLUSIONS WHICH MIGHT AFFECT YOUR COVERAGE, SUCH AS AN EXCLUSION FOR NUCLEAR EVENTS. UNDER THE FORMULA, THE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT GENERALLY REIMBURSES 85% OF COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES EXCEEDING THE STATUTORILY ESTABLISHED DEDUCTIBLE PAID BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY PROVIDING THE COVERAGE. THE PREMIUM CHARGED FOR THIS COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BELOW AND DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY
CHARGES FOR THE PORTION OF LOSS THAT MAY BE COVERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE ACT. </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE
ACT, AS AMENDED, CONTAINS A $100 BILLION CAP THAT LIMITS U.S. GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT AS WELL AS INSURERS&#146; LIABILITY FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM WHEN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH LOSSES IN ANY ONE CALENDAR YEAR EXCEEDS $100
BILLION. IF THE AGGREGATE INSURED LOSSES FOR ALL INSURERS EXCEED $100 BILLION, YOUR COVERAGE MAY BE REDUCED. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Acceptance or Rejection of Terrorism
