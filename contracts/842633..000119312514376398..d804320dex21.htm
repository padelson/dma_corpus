hereof, TriMas Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), ALLFAST

and, for purposes of _Sections 5.13_ through _5.16_ and _Article IX_ hereof,
James H. Randall (" _Beneficial Seller_ ").

_RECITALS_

 

A. Seller is the owner of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common

from Seller, the Shares upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

 

C. Prior to the Closing, the Company will complete the transactions set forth
on _Section C_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Conversion Transactions_
"), and, after giving effect to the Conversion Transactions, references herein

membership interests of the Company and references to the Seller shall be
references to the New Corporation, and provisions relating to the sale and
purchase thereof shall be construed _mutatis mutandis_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall have no liability or other responsibility for
the effects of the Conversion Transactions on the representations, warranties,
covenants or conditions made herein (other than as set forth in _Section
5.23_).

 

D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Eleanor Randall has
executed and delivered to Purchaser her consent to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Eleanor Randall Consent_
").

E. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the parties hereby agree
as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_PURCHASE AND SALE; CLOSING_

1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Seller hereby agrees to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to
Purchaser on the Closing Date, and Purchaser hereby agrees to purchase and
accept from Seller on the Closing Date, all of the Shares. At the Closing,
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, against payment of the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 1.2(b)_ hereof, the certificates representing the Shares

to receive from Purchaser, an amount, payable in cash by wire transfer of

equal to (i) the Purchase Price (excluding any Additional Purchase Price
Amount and any Additional California Tax Amount) _minus_ (ii) the sum of (A)
the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Company and the Subsidiaries
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing less the aggregate amount of any
Cash of the Company and the Subsidiaries have on the Closing Date, (B) the
Seller Expenses to the extent unpaid prior to the Closing and otherwise paid
by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.2(c)_, (C) the Escrow Amount and (D) the

(c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall, on behalf of the Company, the
Subsidiaries and Seller, as applicable, pay (A) to the holders thereof the
outstanding principal amount, together with all accrued and unpaid interest
through the Closing Date and prepayment or other penalties or premiums, if
any, owed with respect to the Indebtedness of the Company and the Subsidiaries
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, (B) the Seller Expenses accrued
but unpaid as of the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date and all Seller Expenses that will accrue on the

Agent the Escrow Amount for disbursement in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

 

(d) On the next regularly scheduled payroll payment date after the Closing,
Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay each Non-Executive Bonus Recipient
the amounts owed to such Non-Executive Bonus Recipient as indicated on the
Closing Bonus Schedule. All such payments will be made from the Bonus Reserve
in accordance with the Companys standard payroll practices as in effect at
such time (and shall be net of applicable withholding Taxes). The Purchaser
shall cause the Company to timely remit all withholding Taxes to the
applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Laws and to
timely pay the employer portion of any payroll, social security, unemployment
or similar Taxes in respect of the payments made pursuant to this _Section
1.2(d)_

 

(e) On the next regularly scheduled payroll payment date after the Closing,
Purchaser shall cause the Company to pay each Retention Bonus Recipient one-
half ( 1⁄2) of the amounts owed to such Retention Bonus Recipient as indicated
on the Closing Bonus Schedule in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Retention Bonus Agreement. All such payments will be made in accordance with
the Companys standard payroll practices as in effect at such time (and shall
be net of applicable withholding Taxes). On the eighteen (18)
month anniversary

 



-2-  of the Closing Date (or earlier, if applicable), Purchaser shall cause the
Company to pay each Retention Bonus Recipient one-half ( 1⁄2) of the amounts
owed to such Retention Bonus Recipient as indicated on the Closing Bonus
Schedule in accordance with the terms of the applicable Retention Bonus
Agreement. All such payments will be made in accordance with the Companys
standard payroll practices as in effect at such time (and shall be net of
applicable withholding Taxes). The Purchaser shall cause the Company to timely
remit all withholding Taxes to the applicable Governmental Authority in
accordance with Applicable Laws and to timely pay the employer portion of any
payroll, social security, unemployment or similar Taxes in respect of the
payments made pursuant to this _Section 1.2(e)_. An amount equal to
the aggregate bonus amounts set forth on the Closing Bonus Schedule remaining
unpaid after the Companys satisfaction of its payment obligations under
_Sections 1.2(d)_ and _(e)_ shall reasonably promptly be delivered by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by Seller.

1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale contemplated hereby (the
" _Closing_ ") will be effectuated electronically (a) at 10:00 a.m. (Los
Angeles, California time) on the second (2nd) Business Day following the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) waiver of each of
the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) waiver of those
conditions); or (b) at such other time or date as may be agreed to by the
parties hereto. Such time and date are referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Closing Date_." With respect to the Closing Date contemplated by clause (a)
of this _Section 1.3_, and without limiting the applicability of clause (b)
of this _Section 1.3_, Purchaser shall have the option, for the sole purpose
of arranging the Debt Financing, to postpone such Closing Date to a Business
Day that is within the thirty (30) day period following the date specified in
such clause (a), by delivering notice to the Seller; _provided_ that for the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that receipt of
financing, including the Debt Financing, is not a condition to Purchasers
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

1.4 _Deliveries_. At the Closing, in addition to the deliveries otherwise
contemplated under this Agreement:

 

(a) Seller shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser certificates
evidencing the Shares, duly endorsed in blank, or accompanied by stock powers

(iv) written confirmation from an officer of the Company that the Employment
Agreements, the Consultancy Services Agreement and the Eleanor Randall

remain in full force and effect other than, in the case of the Employment

disability in accordance with the terms thereof;

 

(v) evidence that the Contracts set forth on _Section 3.20_ of the Disclosure
Schedule and marked with an asterisk (*) thereon have been terminated and are
of no further force or effect;

(vi) evidence that the "change of control" Contracts set forth on  _Section

(vii) the Real Property Transfer Documents;

 

(viii) the Retention Bonus Agreements; and.

 

(ix) documents evidencing the contribution of the shares of the Company to New

including a copy of, the IRS Form 8869 with the IRS to make the "qualified
subchapter S subsidiary" election with respect to the Company, and evidence

to California law effective prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Purchaser shall deliver:

 

(i) the amounts contemplated by _Section 1.2_;

 

(ii) a certificate of the Companies House as to the good standing as of the
most recent practicable date of the Purchaser; and

force and effect.

(d) On or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall enter into the
Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent.

(e) The parties shall deliver such other certificates, instruments or
documents as required by _Article VI_ or any other provision of this
Agreement.

1.5 _Pre-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) At least seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser a good faith estimate (the " _Working Capital Estimate_
") of the Net Working

 



-4-  Capital as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and determined in accordance with GAAP, together with related
supporting schedules, calculations and documentation and any resulting Working
Capital Overage or Working Capital Deficiency. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser
shall review the Working Capital Estimate and mutually agree in good faith
with Seller on such Working Capital Estimate, except that if Seller and
Purchaser cannot agree on the Working Capital Estimate by the Closing Date,
then the Working Capital Estimate of Seller shall be used for purposes of 
_Section 1.2_, subject to final resolution pursuant to _Section 1.6_. A "
_Working Capital Overage_ " shall exist when (and shall be equal to the amount
by which) the Working Capital Estimate exceeds the Target Working Capital,
which amount shall be added to the Purchase Price as contemplated in the
definition thereof contained in _Section 1.2_. A " _Working Capital
Deficiency_ " shall exist when (and shall be equal to the amount by which)
the Target Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Estimate, which amount
shall be subtracted from the Purchase Price as contemplated in the definition
thereof contained in _Section 1.2_.

 

1.6 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Working Capital Statement_. As soon as practicable but in no event later
than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller a statement (the " _Working Capital Statement_ ") of the Net Working
Capital as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date without giving effect to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and determined in accordance with GAAP (the " _Final Working Capital_
"), together with related supporting schedules, calculations and
documentation.

 

(b) _Dispute_. Within thirty (30) days following receipt by Seller of the
Working Capital Statement, Seller shall either inform Purchaser in writing
that the Working Capital Statement is acceptable, or deliver written notice
(the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Purchaser of any dispute Seller has with
respect to the preparation or content of the Working Capital Statement or the
Final Working Capital reflected therein. The Notice of Disagreement must
describe in reasonable detail the items contained in the Working Capital
Statement that Seller disputes and the basis for any such disputes. If Seller
does not notify Purchaser of a dispute with respect to the Working Capital
Statement within such 30-day period, such Working Capital Statement and the
Final Working Capital reflected in the Working Capital Statement will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties. In the event a Notice of
Disagreement is delivered to Purchaser, Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Purchaser and Seller,
notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within
thirty (30) days after Seller delivers the Notice of Disagreement, then
Purchaser and Seller jointly shall engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve such
dispute in accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section
1.6(b)_. Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to cause the
Arbitration Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted
to the Arbitration Firm within thirty (30) days of the making of such
submission. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Arbitration Firm
shall be limited to whether the items in dispute that were properly included
in the Notice of Disagreement were prepared in accordance with GAAP and the
Arbitration Firm shall determine, on such basis, whether and to what extent,
the Working Capital Statement and the Final Working Capital, as applicable,
reflected therein require adjustment. The Arbitration Firm is not to make any
other determination, including any 

 



-5-  determination as to whether the Target Working Capital or the Working
Capital Estimate is correct. The Arbitration Firms decision shall be based
solely on written submissions by Seller and Purchaser and their respective
representatives and not by independent review. The Arbitration Firm shall
address only those items in dispute and may not assign a value greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party. Judgment may be entered
upon the determination of the Arbitration Firm in any court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. Purchaser and Seller shall share equally the fees and expenses of
the Arbitration Firm. All determinations made by the Arbitration Firm will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties.

 

(c) _Access_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this

businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries are, in the aggregate, in good
operating condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted, other than

and all leases or other occupancy agreements relative to the Real Property to
which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is a party (each, a " _Real

connection therewith have been timely paid, and no such fees are due within
the three-month

 



-11-  period after the Closing Date, and all necessary documents and certificates
in connection therewith have been timely filed with the relevant Governmental
Authorities, as the case may be, for the purposes of maintaining such
registered or pending Intellectual Property in full force and effect in the
jurisdictions where it is currently registered or pending. The business and
operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries, as currently conducted, do
not infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual
Property rights of any other Person. To the Knowledge of the Company, all of
the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any Subsidiary is valid
and enforceable, and owned free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted

$200,000 or more. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no actions, suits or
proceedings threatened against the Company, the Subsidiaries or their
respective assets, at law or in equity, by or before any Governmental

Schedule sets forth each Proceeding (or series of related Proceedings) that

3.12 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Section 3.12(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete list
of (i) (1) all "employee benefit plans" (as that term is defined in Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("
_ERISA_ ")), (2) all other employment, severance pay, salary continuation,
bonus, incentive, stock option, equity-based retirement, pension, profit
sharing or deferred compensation plans, contracts, programs, funds, or
arrangements of any kind, and (3) all other employee benefit plans, contracts,
programs, funds, or arrangements (whether written or oral, qualified or
nonqualified, funded or unfunded, foreign or domestic, currently effective or
terminated) and any trust, escrow or similar agreement related thereto,
whether or not funded, in respect of any present or former
employees, directors, officers, equity holders, consultants, or independent
contractors of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries that are sponsored or
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made or is required to make
payments, transfers or contributions, and (ii) any "defined benefit plan" as
defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, any pension plan subject to the funding
standards of Section 302 of ERISA or

 



-12-  Section 412 of the Code or any "multiple employer plan" within the meaning
of Section 210(a) of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code of any member of the
Controlled Group with respect to which the Company has any liability (all of
the foregoing in (i) and (ii) being referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Company Benefit Plans_ ") and (iii) , any "multiemployer plan" as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any member of the Controlled Group is required to
make payments or contributions (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "). Except as
contemplated by the Employment Agreements, Consultancy Services Agreement, the
Retention Bonus Agreements and the Closing Bonus Schedule, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability with respect to any plan,
arrangement or practice of the type described in the preceding sentence other
than the Company Benefit Plans and any Multiemployer Plan.

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained, operated and administered
in compliance in all material respects with its terms and any related
documents or agreements and in compliance in all material respects with ERISA,
the Code and all other Applicable Laws. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys Knowledge, any other "disqualified person"
or "party in interest" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code and Section
3(14) of ERISA, respectively) with respect to a Company Benefit Plan has
breached the fiduciary rules of ERISA or engaged in a prohibited transaction
that could subject the Company or its Subsidiaries to a material Tax or
penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 502(i), (j) or (l)
of ERISA. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other member of
the Controlled Group has an obligation to contribute to, or any liability with
respect to, a "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, a
pension plan subject to the funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, a Multiemployer Plan or a "multiple employer
plan" within the meaning of Section 210(a) of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the
Code.

(c) Except as required under Section 4980B of the Code or provided on
_Section 3.12(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan
provides any health, life insurance or severance payments or benefits to any
service provider following termination of employment. With respect to each
group health plan benefiting any current or former employee of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any other member of the Controlled Group that is
subject to Section 4980B of the Code, the Company, each of its Subsidiaries
and each other member of the Controlled Group have complied with the
continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA. The Company and its Subsidiaries have made
available to Purchaser or to Purchasers counsel any information identifying
former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and any eligible
dependent thereof, who are receiving continuation coverage pursuant to Part 6
of Subtitle B of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended, as of immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have made available to Purchaser or to
Purchasers counsel true and complete copies of the following documents
relating to the Company Benefit Plans: (i) all Company Benefit Plan documents
(or in the case of an unwritten Company Benefit Plan, a written description
thereof); (ii) the Form 5500 filed for each of the three most recent plan
years for each Company Benefit Plan for which a Form 5500 is required to be
filed, (iii) all determination or opinion letters from the IRS with respect
to any of the

 



-13-  Company Benefit Plans, (iv) all summary plan descriptions and summaries of
material modifications with respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans, and
(v) all trust agreements and insurance contracts that fund or pay benefits
under any Company Benefit Plan.

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code is so qualified and has been determined by the IRS to be so
qualified, and each trust created thereunder has been determined by the IRS to
be exempt from tax under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code, and
nothing has occurred since the date of any such determination that could
reasonably be expected to give the IRS grounds to revoke such determination.
No Company Benefit Plan is or at any time was funded through a "welfare
benefit fund" as defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, and no benefits under
any Company Benefit Plan are or at any time have been provided through a
voluntary employees beneficiary association (within the meaning of subsection
501(c)(9) of the Code) or a supplemental unemployment benefit plan (within
the meaning of Section 501(c)(17) of the Code). There is no pending or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened assessment, complaint, proceeding, or
investigation of any kind in any court or Governmental Authority with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

(f) All (i) insurance premiums required to be paid with respect to, (ii)
benefits, expenses, and other amounts due and payable under, and (iii)
contributions, transfers, or payments required to be made to, any Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date will have been paid, made or accrued
on or before the Closing Date. With respect to any insurance policy providing
funding for benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, there is no liability of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the nature of a retroactive rate
adjustment, loss sharing arrangement, or other actual or contingent liability,
nor would there be any such liability if such insurance policy was terminated
on the Closing Date.

 

(g) Except as contemplated by _Sections 6.2(m)_ and _(n)_ or the Closing
Bonus Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed or
committed to institute any plan, program, arrangement or agreement for the
benefit of employees or former employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries other than the Company Benefit Plans, or to make any
amendments to any of the Company Benefit Plans, except as required by Law.
Except as provided in _Section 3.12(g)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no
Company Benefit Plan provides benefits to any individual who is not a current
or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the
dependents or other beneficiaries of any such current or former employee.

(h) Except as provided in _Section 3.12(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement could reasonably be expected
to, either alone or in conjunction with any other event (whether contingent
or otherwise) (i) constitute a stated triggering event under any Company
Benefit Plan that will result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise) becoming due from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
current or former director, manager, officer, employee or consultant (or
dependents of such Persons), or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to any current or former
director, manager, officer, employee or consultant (or dependents of such
Persons) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



-14- (i) The Company and its Subsidiaries have made available to Purchaser or to
Purchasers counsel lists, to the extent applicable, as of the date hereof,
for each employee, consultant, independent contractor and director of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, his or her: name; title; employer; location;
date of hire; exempt/non-exempt status; employment status (i.e., whether

annual base salary or hourly wage rate (or other compensation), target

year to date, and such lists are accurate in all material respects as of the
date hereof.

Schedule:

 

(a) The Company and the Subsidiaries have (i) timely filed (after giving
effect to applicable extensions) with the appropriate Taxing Authorities in

_Projections_ "). Purchaser acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such Projections, that Purchaser is familiar with such
uncertainties, that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Projections so furnished
to it and any use of or reliance by Purchaser on such Projections shall be at
its sole risk, and without limiting any other provisions herein, that
Purchaser shall not have any claim against anyone with respect thereto.
Accordingly, Purchaser acknowledges, agrees and confirms

 



-25-  that the Company and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents
and representatives, do not make, have not made nor shall be deemed to have
made any representation or warranty to Purchaser, express or implied, at law
or in equity, with respect to such Projections.

4.9 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries will
be able to pay their respective debts as they become due and will own property
which has a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay
their respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all
contingent liabilities). Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries will
have adequate capital available to carry on their respective businesses.

4.10 _Accounting Principles_. Purchaser acknowledges that it has fully
reviewed, and hereby accepts for purposes of calculating the Working Capital
Estimate and the Final Working Capital, the Companys historical accounting
principles, methodologies and adjustments, each determined in accordance with
GAAP (subject to inventory variances not being capitalized), which are set
forth on _Section 4.10_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

4.11  _Brokers_. No broker, finder or financial advisor or other Person is
entitled to any brokerage fees, commissions, finders fees or financial
advisory fees in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby by
reason of any action taken by Purchaser or any of its partners, directors,
officers, employees, representatives or agents.

of the Confidentiality Agreement, including returning or destroying all
confidential information and the non-soliciting of employees of the Company or

consent may be conditioned on a designee of Seller or the Company being
present at any such contact, communication, meeting or conference.

 



-28- 5.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Laws to cause
the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest practicable date.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Closing to occur by the Outside Date.

 

5.4 _Consents_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
licenses, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals of all third parties
and Governmental Authorities necessary in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing. Each of
the parties hereto will make or cause to be made all filings and submissions
under Applicable Laws as may be required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto will
coordinate and cooperate with each other in exchanging such information and
assistance as any of the parties hereto may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing.

 

5.5 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto shall not issue any report,
statement or press release or otherwise make any public statement with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without
prior consultation with and approval of the other parties, except as may be
required by Applicable Law or Nasdaq listing requirements, in which case such
party shall advise the other parties and discuss the contents of the
disclosure before issuing any such report, statement or press release.

5.6  _Filings and Authorizations; Consummation_. Purchaser and the Company
shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five (5)
Business Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, submit
all filings required by the HSR Act (the " _HSR Filing_ ") to the United
States Department of Justice and/or the Federal Trade Commission, as
appropriate, and thereafter provide any supplemental information requested in
connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and make any similar filing
within, to the extent reasonably practicable, a similar time frame with any
other Governmental Authority for which such filing is required. Purchaser
shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act or any other antitrust law or
regulation. Any such notification and report form and supplemental information
will be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act or
other applicable antitrust law or regulation. Purchaser and the Company
shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act or other applicable
antitrust law or regulation. Purchaser and the Company shall request early
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and any other
applicable antitrust law or regulation. Purchaser and the Company shall
promptly inform the other party of any material communication received by
such party from any Governmental Authority in respect of the HSR Filing. Each
of Purchaser and the Company shall (a) use its respective reasonable best
efforts to comply as expeditiously as possible with all requests of any
Governmental Authority for additional information and documents, including,
without limitation, information or documents requested under the HSR Act or
other applicable antitrust law or regulation; (b) not (i) extend any
waiting period under the HSR Act or any applicable antitrust law regulation,
or (ii) enter into any agreement with any Governmental

 



-29-  Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except, in each case, with the prior consent of the other parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser will
use its reasonable best efforts to take all steps necessary to avoid,
eliminate or resolve each and every applicable impediment under any antitrust
law or regulation that is asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other
Person with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement so as to
enable the Closing to occur expeditiously. Such steps may include, but are not
limited to, proposing, negotiating, committing to and/or effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divesture or
disposition of, or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise), such of its or the Companys assets, properties or businesses as
necessary to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order
which would have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby provided that Purchaser is
not obligated to take any action contemplated by this sentence unless such
action is expressly a condition to Closing. Purchaser shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to defend through litigation any claim that the
transaction as proposed violates any antitrust or competition statute,
rule or regulation _; provided, however_ , that Purchaser shall not
undertake, or continue to undertake, any such litigation if it would
materially delay the Closing.

 

5.7 _Certain Actions_. Purchaser shall not knowingly take any affirmative
action that would reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect.

5.8 _Notice of Events_.

 

(a) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly notify the Company in
writing if Purchaser becomes aware of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of
any event or the existence of any fact or condition that would cause or
constitute a breach of any of its representations or warranties had any
such representation or warranty been made as of the time of Purchasers
discovery of such event, fact or condition and (ii) any material failure on
its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.

(b) During the period prior to the Closing Date or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing if the
Company or Seller becomes aware of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any
event or the existence of any fact or condition that would cause or constitute
a breach of any of the Companys or Sellers representations or warranties
contained herein had such representation or warranty been made as of the time
of the discovery of such event, fact or condition and (ii) any material
failure on the part of the Company or Seller to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder. Should any such event, fact or condition require any change to the
Disclosure Schedule, Seller shall promptly deliver to Purchaser a supplement
to the Disclosure Schedule specifying such change, except that Seller shall
not be entitled to supplement the Disclosure Schedule with respect to the
Seller Extended Representations or the Company Extended Representations (other
than the representations and warranties in _Sections 3.12_ and _3.13_ ).

 



-30- (c) In the event that Seller delivers one or more supplements to the
Disclosure Schedule pursuant to _Section 5.8(b)_ _,_ and:

(i) the disclosures contained in such supplements to the Disclosure Schedule
are not reasonably expected to cause losses (individually or in the
aggregate) equal to or greater than $1,000,000, the Seller and Purchaser
hereby agree that the closing conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ shall not
have been adversely affected by such disclosures, and Purchaser will be
deemed to have accepted such supplemented Disclosure Schedule, the delivery of
any such supplement will be deemed to have cured any misrepresentation or
breach of any representation or warranty and, from and after the Closing
Date, no Purchaser Indemnitee will have any claim for indemnification based on
the disclosure contained in such supplemented Disclosure Schedule; or

 

(ii) the disclosures contained in such supplements to the Disclosure Schedule
are reasonably expected to cause losses (individually or in the aggregate)
equal to or greater than $1,000,000, the Seller and Purchaser hereby agree
that Purchaser may, at its discretion:

 

(A) decide to proceed with the Closing, and Purchaser will be deemed to have
accepted such supplemented Disclosure Schedule, the delivery of any such
supplement will be deemed to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of any
representation or warranty and, from and after the Closing Date, no Purchaser
Indemnitee will have any claim for indemnification based on the disclosure
contained in such supplemented Disclosure Schedule; or

(B) decide to terminate this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if
Purchaser decides to terminate this Agreement, Seller may agree to indemnify
Purchaser for any and all Damages relating to the disclosure contained in such
supplemented Disclosure Schedule, and upon Sellers written agreement to so
indemnify Purchaser, in form and substances reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser, Purchaser shall be deemed to have cancelled its right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section.

 

(d) In no event shall any supplement to the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to
this _Section 5.8_ contain any matter that existed prior to the execution
and delivery of this Agreement.

5.9 _Exculpation_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.10_, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Subsidiaries to, exculpate (to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law) and indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and also advance expenses as
incurred, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law,
to each Person who is now or has been prior to the date hereof or who becomes
prior to the Closing an officer or director of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (a " _Covered Person_ ") from and against all losses, claims,
damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses),
settlement payments or liabilities arising out of or in connection with any
Proceeding based on or arising out of the fact that such Person is or was an
officer or director of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, whether or not
such Proceeding is asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Person to whom such expenses are advanced
provides a customary unsecured undertaking to the

 



-31-  Company to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_
, that such indemnification, defense, hold harmless and expense advancement
requirement shall not apply to any losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
settlement payments or liabilities of any Covered Person arising as a result
of such Covered Persons breaching or failing to perform such Covered
Persons obligations under this Agreement or under any other agreements
contemplated hereby to which such Covered Person is a party.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate to
purchase and bind officers and directors liability tail insurance in the
amount of $2 million covering, for a period of six (6) years, the Persons who
are, as of and prior to the Closing Date, covered by the Companys officers
and directors liability insurance policies with respect to actions and
omissions occurring prior to and on the Closing Date, on terms which are no
less favorable to such Persons than the terms of such current insurance in
effect for the Company prior to the Closing. From and after the Closing,
the Company shall maintain such policy in full force and effect for the
duration of its term.

(b) If (but only if) for any reason the indemnity provided for in this
_Section 5.9_ is unavailable to any such Person entitled to indemnification
or is insufficient to hold each such Person harmless from all such Damages,
then Purchaser and the Company shall jointly and severally contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Person in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand
and such Person on the other, but also the relative fault of such Persons as
well as any relevant equitable considerations.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, the Persons listed on _Section 5.9_ of the
Disclosure Schedule together with their respective heirs.

 

5.10 _Tax Covenants_.

(a)  _Tax Returns_.

(i) Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and shall timely file, or cause to be filed, (A) all Tax Returns of
the Company and the Subsidiaries due (after taking into account all
appropriate extensions) on or prior to the Closing Date; (B) all Tax Returns
of the Prior Company for any year ending prior to the Closing Date; and (C)
all Tax Returns of Seller (such Tax Returns described in subclause (B), the "
_Seller Prepared Returns_ "). All such Seller Prepared Returns shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and
accounting methods of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and, to the extent
applicable, the conventions provided in _Section 5.10(a)(iv)_, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law. At least forty-five (45) days prior to
the due date of any Seller Prepared Return, Seller shall provide a draft of
such Tax Return to Purchaser for Purchasers review and comment. Purchaser
shall provide any written comments to Seller no later than ten (10) days
after receiving such Tax Return and, if Purchaser does not provide any
written comments within ten (10) days, Purchaser shall be deemed to have
accepted such Tax Return. The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve
any dispute with respect to such Tax

 



-32-  Return. If the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute at least ten
(10) days before the due date (with applicable extensions) for any such Tax
Return, the dispute shall be referred to the Arbitration Firm for resolution
and the fees shall be divided as set forth in _Section 1.6_. If the
Arbitration Firm is unable to resolve any such dispute prior to the due date
(with applicable extensions) for any such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall
be filed as prepared by Purchaser subject to amendment, if necessary, to
reflect the resolution of the dispute by the Arbitration Firm. Purchaser shall
timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all Seller Prepared
Returns prepared, or caused to be prepared, by Seller pursuant to this
_Section 5.10(a)_. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Indemnified Taxes
imposed on the Company and the Subsidiaries shown as due and owing on such Tax
Returns attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(ii) Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, shall cause the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company to prepare and timely file all Tax Returns (other
than Seller Prepared Returns) of the Company and each Subsidiary due after the
Closing Date (the " _Purchaser Prepared Returns_ "). To the extent that a
Purchaser Prepared Return relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle
Period, such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with existing
procedures and practices and accounting methods, and, to the extent
applicable, the conventions provided in  _Section 5.10(a)(iv)_, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law. At least forty-five (45) days prior to
the due date of any Purchaser Prepared Return, Purchaser shall provide a draft
of such Tax Return to Seller for Sellers review and comment. Seller shall
provide any written comments to Purchaser no later than ten (10) days after
receiving such Tax Return and, if Seller does not provide any written comments
within ten (10) days, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted such Tax
Return. The parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute with
respect to such Tax Return. If the parties are unable to resolve any such
dispute at least ten (10) days before the due date (with
applicable extensions) for any such Tax Return, the dispute shall be referred
to the Arbitration Firm for resolution and the fees shall be divided as set
forth in _Section 1.6_. If the Arbitration Firm is unable to resolve any such
dispute prior to the due date (with applicable extensions) for any such Tax
Return, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Purchaser subject to
amendment, if necessary, to reflect the resolution of the dispute by the
Arbitration Firm. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Indemnified Taxes
shown as due on any Purchaser Prepared Return attributable to (A) any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or (B) the portion of any Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date.

 

(iii) Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, Purchaser shall not, and
shall not allow the Company or the Subsidiaries to amend any Tax Return of
the Prior Company, the Company or the Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period or otherwise initiate (or agree to) any other Seller
Tax Matter without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed.

(iv) With respect to certain Tax matters, unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law, Seller and Purchaser agree as follows:

(A) To treat deductions with respect to the Seller Expenses that accrued on
or prior to the Closing Date as being currently deductible by the Company as
a deduction for income Tax purposes on the Companys IRS Form 1120S for the
year ending as of the day before the Closing Date.

 



-33- (B) To treat (and have the Company and each Subsidiary treat) any gains,
income, deductions, losses, or other items realized by the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries for income Tax purposes with respect to any Purchaser Closing
Date Transaction as occurring on the day immediately following the Closing
Date.

 

(C) To treat all indemnification payments under this Agreement as adjustments
to the Purchase Price for all relevant Tax purposes.

(D) To timely and properly make a safe harbor election under Rev. Proc.
2011-29 to currently deduct seventy percent (70%) of the Seller Expenses that
are success-based fees.

(E) To treat Steps 1 through 3 of the Conversion Transactions set forth on
_Schedule C_ as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F)
of the Code such that Seller succeeds to the "S election" of the Company and
that the Seller shall file a Tax Return for the year including the Closing
Date that includes the income, gain, loss, and deduction of the Company
through the end of the Closing Date.

 

(F) To treat all income tax deductions with respect to payments pursuant to
the Retention Bonus Agreements made on or prior to the fifteenth (15th) day
of the second month following the Closing Date as deductible by the Seller on
its tax return for the year including the Closing Date.

 

Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, Seller and Purchaser shall
prepare and file all Tax Returns (and cause the Company and each Subsidiary of
the Company and the Prior Company and each other applicable Affiliate to file
all Tax Returns), including timely and properly making all agreed elections,
consistently with the agreements set forth in this _Section 5.10(a)(iv)_ and
neither Seller nor Purchaser shall take any position (and Purchaser shall not
allow the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any of its other
Affiliates to take any position) on any Tax Return (or during the course of
any audit or other legal proceedings with respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns
(whether or not a Tax Contest)) that is inconsistent with the agreements set
forth in this _Section 5.10(a)(iv)_.

 

(b) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. To the extent permissible under Applicable
Laws, the parties agree to elect (and have the Company and the Subsidiaries
elect) to have each Tax year of the Company and the Subsidiaries to end on the
Closing Date and, if such election is not permitted or required in a
jurisdiction with respect to a specific Tax such that the Company or any
Subsidiary is required to file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, to utilize
the following conventions for determining the amount of Taxes attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date:
(i) in the case of property Taxes and other Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis, such as Taxes other than sales or use Taxes, value-added Taxes,
employment Taxes, withholding Taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by
income, receipts or profits, the amount attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall equal the Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the portion of the period ending on and 

 



-34-  including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes (including income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes, withholding
Taxes), the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date shall be determined as if the Company or
Subsidiary filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date using
a "closing of the books methodology." For purposes of clause (ii), (A) any
item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and
depreciation deductions) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date based on the relative number
of days in such portion of the Straddle Period as compared to the number of
days in the entire Straddle Period; (B) the parties shall use the conventions
provided for in _Section 5.10(a)(iv)(A)_ with respect to allocating the
Seller Expenses; and (C) the parties shall use the conventions provided for
in  _Section 5.10(a)(iv)(B)_ for purposes of allocating the items of income
and gain from Purchaser Closing Date Transactions. In the case of a Tax that
is (i) paid for the privilege of doing business during a period (a "
_Privilege Period_ ") and (ii) computed based on business activity occurring
during an accounting period ending prior to such Privilege Period, any
reference to a "Tax period," a "tax period," or a "taxable period" shall mean
such accounting period and not such Privilege Period.

(c) _Cooperation_. Purchaser, the Company, and Seller shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) (i) assist in the preparation and timely
filing of any Tax Return of the Seller, the Prior Company, Company or the
Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (ii)
make available any information, records, or other documents relating to any
Taxes or Tax Returns of the Seller, the Prior Company, Company or the
Subsidiaries (including copies of Tax Returns and related work papers) for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (iii) provide certificates or
forms, and timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary or appropriate to
establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax; and (iv) cause
to be properly executed and timely filed any Seller Prepared Returns as
prepared pursuant to _Section 5.10(a)_ that need to be filed after the
Closing Date.

(d)  _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, excise, sales, use, value added,
registration, stamp, recording, property and analogous Taxes or fees
applicable to, imposed upon, or arising out of the transfer of the shares in
the Company or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement and all
related interest and penalties (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
paid one-half ( 1⁄2) by Purchaser and one-half ( 1⁄2) by Seller.

 

(e) _Tax Refunds_. Except to the extent (i) attributable to any Tax attribute
generated after the Closing or (ii) included as a current asset in the Net
Working Capital, as finally determined, all refunds of Taxes of the Seller,
the Prior Company, Company or any of the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing
Date as determined in accordance with the same principles provided for in
_Section 5.10(b))_ (whether in the form of cash received or a credit against
Taxes otherwise payable) shall be the property of Seller. To the extent
that Purchaser, the Company, or any of the Subsidiaries receives a refund
that is the property of Seller, Purchaser shall pay to Seller for distribution
to Seller the amount of such refund (and interest received from the

Seller, Beneficial Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on

pursuant to this Agreement shall not survive the Closing except to the extent
specified below:

 

(a) All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that contemplate
performance thereof following the Closing Date will survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers
indemnification obligations under _Sections 7.2(a)(ii)_ through _(vi)_ shall
survive indefinitely.

 



-48- (b) All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that contemplate
performance at or prior to the Closing Date will survive until the eighteen-
month anniversary of the Closing Date (such date, the " _Covenant Termination
Date_ ").

 

(c) The representations and warranties contained in _Article II_ , _Article
III_ and _Article IV_ of this Agreement, except for the Extended
Representations, will survive the Closing until the eighteen-month anniversary
of the Closing Date, at which point such representations and warranties and
the right to make any claim for indemnification or reimbursement by any
Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee on account thereof will terminate
(such date, the " _Representation Termination Date_ ").

 

(d) The Company Extended Representations shall survive indefinitely, except

Amount remaining in the Escrow Account (exclusive of amounts retained in
respect of payment of pending claims) to be released and transferred to the

that, from and after the Closing, the exclusive remedies of the parties for
any Damages arising out of or based upon any breach of representations,
warranties or covenants or agreements to be performed at or prior to the
Closing set forth in this Agreement are the indemnification and/or
reimbursement obligations of the parties set forth in this _Article VII_. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, any
and all rights and claims (other than claims of fraud) for Damages it may
have against any other party arising under, based upon or relating to this
Agreement, Seller Agreement or Purchaser Agreement, any document or
certificate delivered in connection herewith, any Applicable Law, common law
or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in

Purchaser, Parent or Purchaser Indemnitee arising from the Puente Valley
Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund Site as well as any such
claims arising from hexavalent chromium groundwater contamination under, on or
about the Real Property. The provisions of this _Section 7.4_ shall
not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action to obtain an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement, or specific performance to
compel performance hereunder.

 

7.5 _Limitations on Reimbursement to and Indemnification of Purchaser
Indemnitees_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the rights of
the Purchaser Indemnitees to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount and
indemnification are limited as follows:

(a) Except with respect to Damages with respect to the breach of the Seller
Extended Representations and the Company Extended Representations, the
Purchaser Indemnitees will not be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement
from the Escrow Amount with respect to the matters described in _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ for any Damages until the total of all such Damages suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnitees exceed $700,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which event the
Purchaser Indemnitees will be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow
Amount for all Damages in excess of the Basket. No claim for indemnification
or reimbursement from the Escrow Amount may be made pursuant to _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ for any individual item where the claim for Damages related
thereto is less than $10,000, and if such claim does not exceed such

 



-51-  amount, the amount of such claim shall not be taken into account in
determining whether or not or to the extent to which the Basket has been
exceeded; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not apply to
claims brought with respect to the Seller Extended Representations or the
Company Extended Representations.

 

(b) All claims for Damages made by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ shall be satisfied by reimbursement solely out of the
Escrow Amount, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and shall not,
individually or in the aggregate, exceed the Cap. All claims for Damages made
by any Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to _Sections 7.2(a)(ii)_ through 
_7.2(a)(vi)_ , and _7.2(b)_ shall be satisfied by Seller subject to _Article
IX_. In no event shall Seller be liable for Damages (either individually or in
the aggregate) pursuant to this _Article VII_ , including without limitation,
any claims in respect of the Company Extended Representations and the Seller
Extended Representations, in excess of the net Purchase Price that Seller
actually receives in cash.

 

(c) The Purchaser Indemnitees right to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount
or indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2_ on account of any Damages shall
be reduced by all insurance or other third party indemnification proceeds
received by the Purchaser Indemnitees. Purchaser and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to claim and recover any
Damages suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees under any such insurance
policies or other third party indemnities. If Purchaser and the Company fail
to pursue recoveries under any "incurrence" based insurance policies or other
third party indemnities, then Seller shall have the right of subrogation to
pursue such insurance policies or other third party indemnities on its behalf
and may take any reasonable actions necessary to pursue such rights of
subrogation in its name or the name of the party from whom subrogation is
obtained. Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate with Seller to pursue any
such subrogation claim.

 

(d) The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to reimbursement from the
Escrow Amount or indemnification pursuant to this Agreement for lost profits,
exemplary damages, special damages, consequential damages or punitive damages,
except, in each case, with respect to Damages actually awarded to a third
party in an action brought against a Purchaser Indemnitee.

 

(e) In addition to other limitations under this _Section 7.5_, Damages of any
Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to any claim for a breach or inaccuracy of
a representation or warranty of _Section 3.13_ or a breach of any covenant of
Seller or the Company with respect to Taxes shall be limited to Tax Losses.

 

7.6 _Limitations on Indemnification of Seller Indemnitees_.

 

(a) Except with respect to Damages with respect to the breach of the Purchaser
Extended Representations, the Seller Indemnitees will not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(1)_ hereof for any Damages until
the total of all such Damages suffered by the Seller Indemnitees exceeds the
Basket, in which event the Seller Indemnitees will be entitled
to indemnification or reimbursement for all Damages in excess of the Basket,
and up to a maximum of the Escrow Amount. No claim for indemnification may be
made pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(1)_ for any individual item where the claim
for Damages related

 



-52-  thereto is less than $10,000, and if such claim does not exceed such amount,
the amount of such claim shall not be taken into account in determining
whether or not or to the extent to which the Basket has been exceeded.

(b) The Seller Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to _Section
7.3_ on account of any Damages shall be reduced by all insurance or other
third party indemnification proceeds actually received by the Seller
Indemnitees. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim and
recover any Damages suffered by the Seller Indemnitees under any such
insurance policies or other third party indemnities. If Seller fails to pursue
recoveries under any "incurrence" based insurance policies or other third
party indemnities, then Purchaser and the Company shall have the right of
subrogation to pursue such insurance policies or other third party indemnities
and may take any reasonable actions necessary to pursue such rights of
subrogation in their name or the name of the party from whom subrogation is
obtained. Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser and the Company to pursue any
such subrogation claim.

(c) The Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this Agreement for lost profits, exemplary damages, special damages,
consequential damages or punitive damages, except, in each case, with respect
to Damages actually awarded to a third party in an action brought
against Seller Indemnitees.

7.7 _Procedures_. The following procedures shall apply to all claims for
indemnification and reimbursement pursuant to this _Article VII_ , other than
those relating to Tax matters, which are governed by _Section 7.8_:

(a)  _Notice of Damages Provided by Seller Indemnitees_. Subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Article VII_ , if any Seller Indemnitee
believes in good faith that it has a claim for indemnification (a " _Seller
Indemnity Claim_ "), Seller shall, promptly after it becomes aware of such
Seller Indemnity Claim but in any event prior to the applicable survival date
under _Section 7.1_, notify Purchaser of such claim by means of a written
notice specifying the nature, circumstances and amount of such claim
accompanied by an affidavit of an authorized person of Seller setting forth
with reasonable particularity the underlying facts actually known or in good
faith believed by the affiant to exist sufficient to establish, as of the
date of such affidavit, the basis for such claim and setting forth Sellers
good faith calculation of the Damages incurred by the applicable Seller
Indemnitee with respect thereto (a " _Seller Claim Notice_ "). The failure by
Seller to promptly deliver a Seller Claim Notice under this _Section 7.7(a)_
will not adversely affect the applicable Seller Indemnitees right to
indemnification except to the extent that Purchaser is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby.

(b) _Notice of Damages Provided by Purchaser Indemnitees_.

 

(i) _Indemnification Claims_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article VII_ , if any Purchaser Indemnitee believes in good faith that it
has a claim for indemnification or reimbursement against the Escrow Amount (a
" _Purchaser Indemnity Claim_ "), Purchaser shall, promptly after it becomes
aware of such Purchaser Indemnity Claim but in any event prior to the
applicable survival date under _Section 7.1_, notify Seller (and, if such
claim is or includes a claim for reimbursement against the Escrow Amount, the
Escrow Agent) of such Purchaser Indemnity Claim by means of a written
notice specifying the nature, circumstances

 



-53-  and amount of such Purchaser Indemnity Claim accompanied by an affidavit of
an officer of the Purchaser setting forth with reasonable particularity the
underlying facts actually known or in good faith believed by the affiant to
exist sufficient to establish, as of the date of such affidavit, the basis for
the Purchaser Indemnity Claim and setting forth Purchasers good faith
calculation of the Damages incurred by the applicable Purchaser Indemnitee
with respect thereto (a " _Purchaser Claim Notice_ "). The failure by
Purchaser to promptly deliver a Purchaser Claim Notice under this _Section
7.7(b)(i)_ will not adversely affect the applicable Purchaser Indemnitees
right to indemnification or reimbursement from the Escrow Amount except to the
extent that Seller is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. Upon receipt
of a Purchaser Claim Notice from Purchaser, Seller shall have thirty (30)
days to (A) if and to the extent such Purchaser Claim Notice includes a claim
for reimbursement against the Escrow Amount, send a joint written instruction,
together with Purchaser, to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to
pay to Purchaser from the Escrow Amount the amount of Damages so specified in
the Purchaser Claim Notice subject to the limitations contained in this
_Article VII_ , (B) if and to the extent such Purchaser Claim Notice includes
a claim for indemnification other than against the Escrow Amount, pay to
Purchaser the amount of Damages so specified in the Purchaser Claim Notice
subject to the limitations contained in this _Article VII_ or (C) deliver to
Purchaser (and, if such claim is or includes a claim for reimbursement
against the Escrow Amount, to the Escrow Agent) notice in writing that Seller
objects to the Purchaser Indemnity Claim (or the amount of Damages set forth
therein) asserted in such Purchaser Claim Notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ").

(ii) _Indemnification Claim Disputes_. If Seller delivers a Dispute Notice
to Purchaser, Purchaser and Seller shall promptly meet and use their
reasonable efforts to settle the dispute as to whether and to what extent the
Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to reimbursement on account of such
Purchaser Indemnity Claim. If Purchaser and Seller are able to reach
agreement within thirty (30) days after Purchaser receives such Dispute Notice
(the " _Dispute Period_ "), as applicable, (A) Purchaser and Seller shall
deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent setting forth such
agreement and instructing the Escrow Agent to release funds from the Escrow
Amount subject to the limitations contained in this _Article VII_ and/or (B)
Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount in accordance with such agreement. If
Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach agreement within the Dispute Period,
then the dispute may be submitted to arbitration pursuant to _Section 9.15_
by either Purchaser or Seller. For all purposes of any dispute pursuant to
this _Article VII_ , Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with and make
available to the other party and its representatives all information, records
and data, and shall permit reasonable access to its facilities and personnel,
as may be reasonably required in connection with the resolution of such
disputes.

(c) _Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims_. In the event of any claim by
a third party against any Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitees for which
indemnification or reimbursement is or may be available under this _Article
VII_ (whether pursuant to a lawsuit, other legal action or otherwise, a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), and, if (A) in the event that the Indemnified Party is
a Purchaser Indemnitee and the Purchaser Indemnitee makes a claim for Damages
pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)(i)_, the then-available portion of the Escrow
Amount is sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, to
satisfy at least two-thirds (2/3) of the amount of any adverse monetary
judgment or settlement that is reasonably likely to result, (B) the Third
Party Claim does not seek (and continues to not seek) injunctive or other non-
monetary equitable relief, except for injunctive or other non-monetary
equitable relief that (x) is ancillary 

 



-54-  to a claim for monetary damages or (y) in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnified Party would not have a material and adverse effect on the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates if granted and (C) subject to the
last sentence of this _Section 7.7(c)_, the Indemnifying Party expressly
agrees in writing that as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be solely obligated to satisfy and
discharge the Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms set forth in this
Agreement (the conditions set forth in the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C),
the " _Litigation Conditions_ "), then the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled and, if it so elects, shall be obligated at its own cost and expense,
(i) to take control of the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim
and (ii) to pursue the defense thereof in good faith by appropriate actions
or proceedings promptly taken or instituted and diligently pursued, including,
without limitation, to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to handle and defend such
Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled (but not
obligated), if it so elects, to compromise or settle such claim, which
compromise or settlement shall be made only with the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
provided that such consent may be granted or withheld at the absolute and sole
discretion of the Indemnified Party in the event the Third Party Claim seeks
non-monetary relief, such as injunctive or other equitable relief; _provided_
, _however_ , that if (1) any of the Litigation Conditions cease to be met or
(2) the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend
diligently such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party may assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable
for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection therewith.
In the event the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense
and investigation of such Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section
7.7(c)_, the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost and expense, participate
in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim, provided
that if the named Persons to a lawsuit or other legal action include both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party has
been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available
to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled,
at the Indemnifying Partys cost, risk and expense, to retain one firm of
separate counsel of its own choosing (along with any required local counsel).
If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim in accordance with this _Section 7.7(c)_ within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the notice delivered in connection with such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted
shall (upon delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party) have
the right to undertake the defense of such Third Party Claim, and, if it so
elects, to compromise or settle such Third Party Claim (but only with the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of the claim, the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party
reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or
settlement, and in the event the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the
claim, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense and, in the course of defending such
Third Party Claim or otherwise, discovers that (X) the facts presented at the
time the Indemnifying Party confirmed the application of the indemnification
provisions hereof pursuant to subpart (C) of this _Section 7.7(c)_ were not
true and (Y) such untruth provides a reasonable basis for asserting that the
Indemnifying Party does not have any indemnification obligation in respect of
such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall not be bound by such
confirmation.

 



-55- 7.8 _Tax Contests_.

 

(a) If any Governmental Authority issues to the Company or any Subsidiary (A)

respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Prior Company or the Company or the
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or (B) a notice
of deficiency for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle

(b) The Company or applicable Subsidiary shall control any audit or other
legal proceeding in respect of any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Prior Company,

the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that have been consented to as
provided for in _Section 5.10(a)(iii)_ (a " _Tax Contest_ "); _provided,
however_ , (X) Seller, at Sellers sole cost and expense, shall have the right
to control any Tax Contest (including the settlement or resolution thereof)
but only if such Tax Contest relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and
any Tax Contest of the Prior Company; (Y) Seller, at Sellers sole cost and
expense, shall have the right to participate in any Tax Contest to the extent
it relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; and (Z) Purchaser
shall not, and shall not allow the Company or any Subsidiary, to settle,
resolve, or abandon a Tax Contest (whether or not Seller controls or
participates in such Tax Contest) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 

(c) If Seller elects to control a Tax Contest for a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(A) Seller shall notify Purchaser of such intent; (B) Purchaser shall
promptly complete and execute, and promptly cause the Company, the
Subsidiaries, or other Purchaser Indemnitee to complete and execute, any
powers of attorney or other documents that are necessary (or that Seller
requests) to allow Seller to control such Tax Contest; (C) prior to Seller
taking control, Purchaser shall control, or cause the Company or applicable
Subsidiary to control, such Tax Contest in good faith and after Seller takes
control, Seller shall control such Tax Contest in good faith; and (D) while
it controls a Tax Contest, Seller shall (1) keep Purchaser reasonably informed
regarding the status of such Tax Contest; (2) allow Purchaser, the Company, or
the Subsidiaries, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, to participate in
such Tax Contest; and (3) not settle, resolve, or abandon any such Tax Contest
without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned).

(d) If Seller elects to participate in a Tax Contest, (A) Seller shall notify
Purchaser of such intent; (B) Purchaser shall control, or cause the Company
or any Subsidiary to control, the Tax Contest in good faith; and (C) Purchaser
shall take all actions (and cause the Company or applicable Subsidiaries of
the Company) required to ensure that Seller has the rights to participate in
the Tax Contest.

 



-56- (e) If Seller does not control or participate in a Tax Contest (whether by
election or otherwise) that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period, (A) Purchaser shall control, or cause the Company or applicable
Subsidiary to control, such Tax Contest in good faith; and (B) Purchaser shall
keep Seller reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest.

(f) To the extent that the provisions of this _Section 7.8_ are inconsistent
with any provision of _Section 7.7_, the provisions of this _Section 7.8_
shall control.

7.9 _Mitigation_. Each party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate any of
its Damages upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto. Each of the parties hereto shall
cooperate with the others with respect to resolving any claim or liability
with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party
hereunder, including by using reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any
such claim or liability and by forgoing any actions that would reasonably
be expected to increase the Damages arising from any such claim or liability;
_provided, however_ , that such party shall not be required to make such
efforts if they would be detrimental in any material respect to such party.

 

7.10 _No Circular Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, neither Seller nor Beneficial Seller shall make
any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 5.9_ hereof, or pursuant
to the constituent documents of the Company or the Subsidiaries, to defend or
pay Damages obtained by any claim brought by any Purchaser Indemnitee against
Seller or Beneficial Seller for breach of this Agreement, or any other Company
Agreement or Seller Agreement.

7.11 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any payments made pursuant to this
_Article VII_ shall be construed as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

-59- or to such other Person or address as any party shall specify by notice in
writing to the other party. All such notices, requests, demands, waivers and
communications shall be deemed to have been given (i) on the date on which so
hand-delivered, (ii) on the third Business Day following the date on which so
mailed and (iii) on the date on which the facsimile or electronic mail is
confirmed, except for a notice of change of address, which shall be effective
only upon receipt thereof.

 

9.3 _Exhibits and Schedules_. Any exception to a representation or warranty
made in this Agreement disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule or in any of the
Exhibits attached hereto shall reasonably identify the exception and describe
the relevant facts in reasonable detail. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document
or other item may not be adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made in this Agreement, unless the representation
or warranty pertains to the existence of the document or other item itself.
Any event or condition specifically disclosed in reasonable detail in any
section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosed or incorporated
into any other section of the Disclosure Schedule with the same degree of
specification where it is apparent on the face of such disclosure that such
disclosure would be appropriate and relevant to such other section of the
Disclosure Schedule. The inclusion of any matter, information or item in any
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an admission of
any liability by the Company or Seller to any third party or otherwise imply
that any such matter, information or item is material or creates a measure for
materiality for the purposes of this Agreement.

 

9.4 _Amendment, Modification and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time by written agreement of the parties
hereto. Any failure of Seller or the Company to comply with any term or
provision of this Agreement may be waived by Purchaser, and any failure of
Purchaser to comply with any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived
by Seller at any time by an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of
such other party, but such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to comply.

 

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedule and the
Exhibits, schedules and other documents referred to herein (including,
without limitation, the Confidentiality Agreement) which form a part hereof
contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, oral and written, with respect to its subject matter
(other than the Confidentiality Agreement).

9.6 _Severability_. Should any provision of this Agreement for any reason be
declared invalid or unenforceable, such decision shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of any of the other provisions of this Agreement, which
other provisions shall remain in full force and effect and the application of
such invalid or unenforceable provision to Persons or circumstances other than
those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall be valid and be
enforced to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

9.7 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective heirs, executors, successors and permitted assigns, but
except as contemplated herein, neither this

 



-60-  Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned, directly or indirectly, by any party without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement (in whole or in
part) without prior written consent to (A) any of its Affiliates or (B) any
Financing Source (including for purposes of creating a security interest or
otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of any Debt Financing).

9.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Other than (a) the Persons listed on
_Section 5.9_ of the Disclosure Schedule (solely with respect to _Section
5.9_), (b) the Financing Sources (solely with respect to _Sections 9.12_ , 
_9.13_ , _9.14_ and _9.18_ ) and (c) the Persons contemplated by _Section
5.22_, this Agreement is not intended and shall not be deemed to confer upon
or give any Person not a party or a permitted assign of a party to this
Agreement any rights, remedies or other benefits under or by reason of this
Agreement.

9.9 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Article I_ ,
_Section 5.6_ and _Section 5.10(d)_, whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated pursuant hereto, each party hereto shall
pay all fees and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with
this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

9.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

 

9.11 _Interpretation_. The article and section headings contained in this
Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the
agreement of the parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The words "include," "includes" and
"including" are deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation." Any
reference to the masculine, feminine or neuter gender shall include such other
genders and any reference to the singular or plural shall include the other,
in each case unless the context otherwise requires. The provisions of this
Agreement shall be construed according to their fair meaning and neither for
nor against any party hereto irrespective of which party caused such
provisions to be drafted. Each of the parties acknowledge that it has been
represented by counsel in connection with the preparation and execution of
this Agreement.

9.12 _Forum; Service of Process_. Except for any dispute, claim or
controversy that is submitted for arbitration pursuant to _Section 9.15_, any
Proceeding brought by any party or any of its Affiliates arising out of or
based upon this Agreement shall only be instituted in any federal or state
court in New York County, New York, and each party waives any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding,
and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit,
action or proceeding. The Financing Sources are express third-party
beneficiaries of the provisions of this _Section 9.12_.

9.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
State of California, excluding choice of law principles that would require the
application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of California.
All actions, proceedings, or counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort
or otherwise) against the Financing Sources arising out of or relating to the
Debt Financing (including the transactions contemplated thereby) and the

 



-61-  performance thereof by the Financing Sources shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. For the
avoidance of doubt, the arbitration provisions in  _Section 9.15_ shall not
apply to any dispute against any Financing Source. The Financing Sources are
express third-party beneficiaries of the provisions of this _Section 9.13_.

 

9.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
DEALINGS BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS TRANSACTION. THE
SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL
DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER
OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS,
BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. THE
PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO ENTER
INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE WAIVER IN
ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE WAIVER
IN THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT AND
REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS, HIS OR HER, AS THE CASE
MAY BE, LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY
TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS
IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING,
AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS
OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE
COURT. THE FINANCING SOURCES ARE EXPRESS THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS  _SECTION 9.14_.

9.15 _Arbitration_.

 

(a) ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY
THEREOF, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OR APPLICABILITY OF THIS
AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, WILL BE DETERMINED BY ARBITRATION AS SET FORTH IN THIS
_SECTION 9.15_.

 

(b) IN THE EVENT THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTED CLAIM OR CLAIMS
UNDER _ARTICLE VII_, ANY OF THE PARTIES MAY REQUEST ARBITRATION OF THE
MATTER UNLESS THE AMOUNT OF THE DAMAGE OR LOSS IS AT ISSUE IN PENDING
LITIGATION WITH A THIRD PARTY, IN WHICH

 



-62-  EVENT RESOLUTION OF ANY DISPUTE WILL BE DETERMINED IN SUCH PROCEEDING OR BY
ARBITRATION AT THE ELECTION OF THE INDEMNIFIED PERSON.

 

(c) THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY JAMS PURSUANT TO ITS COMPREHENSIVE
ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES AND WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THREE (3)
ARBITRATORS WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF A PARTY REQUESTING ARBITRATION PURSUANT
TO THIS _SECTION 9.15_. WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THE COMMENCEMENT OF
ARBITRATION, SELLER, ON THE ONE HAND, AND PURCHASER, ON THE OTHER, WILL
EACH SELECT ONE (1) ARBITRATOR, AND, WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF SUCH SELECTION,
THE TWO (2) ARBITRATORS SO SELECTED WILL SELECT A THIRD ARBITRATOR. IF THE
ARBITRATORS SELECTED BY THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE OR FAIL TO AGREE UPON THE
THIRD ARBITRATOR WITHIN THE ALLOTTED TIME, THE THIRD ARBITRATOR WILL BE
APPOINTED BY JAMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS RULES. THE ARBITRATORS WILL SET A
LIMITED TIME PERIOD AND ESTABLISH PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE COST AND
TIME FOR DISCOVERY WHILE ALLOWING THE PARTIES AN OPPORTUNITY, ADEQUATE IN THE
SOLE JUDGMENT OF THE ARBITRATORS, TO DISCOVER RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THE
OPPOSING PARTY ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE DISPUTE. THE ARBITRATORS WILL
RULE UPON MOTIONS TO COMPEL OR LIMIT DISCOVERY AND WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO
IMPOSE SANCTIONS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS, TO THE EXTENT A COURT
OF COMPETENT LAW OR EQUITY COULD, SHOULD THE ARBITRATORS DETERMINE THAT
DISCOVERY WAS SOUGHT WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL JUSTIFICATION OR THAT DISCOVERY WAS
REFUSED OR OBJECTED TO WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL JUSTIFICATION. THE DECISION OF A
MAJORITY OF THE THREE (3) ARBITRATORS (INCLUDING AS TO THE VALIDITY AND AMOUNT
OF ANY CLAIM) WILL BE BINDING AND CONCLUSIVE UPON THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT. SUCH DECISION WILL BE WRITTEN AND WILL BE SUPPORTED BY WRITTEN
FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS WHICH WILL SET FORTH THE AWARD, JUDGMENT,
DECREE OR ORDER AWARDED BY THE ARBITRATORS. ANY SUCH ARBITRATION WILL BE HELD
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, OR SUCH OTHER LOCATION AS THE PARTIES MAY
MUTUALLY AGREE.

(d) THE PARTIES WILL MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF THE ARBITRATION
PROCEEDING AND THE AWARD, INCLUDING THE HEARING, EXCEPT AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO
PREPARE FOR OR CONDUCT THE ARBITRATION HEARING ON THE MERITS, OR EXCEPT AS MAY
BE NECESSARY IN CONNECTION WITH A COURT APPLICATION FOR A PRELIMINARY REMEDY,
A JUDICIAL CHALLENGE TO AN AWARD OR ITS ENFORCEMENT, OR UNLESS OTHERWISE
REQUIRED BY LAW OR JUDICIAL DECISION.

(e) JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATORS MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY
COURT HAVING JURISDICTION. THIS _SECTION 9.15_ WILL NOT PRECLUDE PARTIES FROM
SEEKING PROVISIONAL REMEDIES IN AID OF ARBITRATION FROM A COURT OF
APPROPRIATE 

 



-63-  JURISDICTION. AS PERMITTED UNDER THIS _SECTION 9.15_ , ANY LEGAL ACTION OR
PROCEEDING IN AID OF ARBITRATION MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY COURT HAVING
JURISDICTION AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE
PARTIES CONSENT, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO SUCH
JURISDICTION. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING
ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON-
CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING AS PERMITTED BY THIS _SECTION 9.15_.

 

(f) THIS _SECTION 9.15_ SHALL BE SUBJECT IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE RIGHTS OF THE
PARTIES UNDER _SECTION 9.17_.

 

9.16 _Beneficial Seller Guaranty_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 9.16(f)_, Beneficial Seller irrevocably guarantees to
Purchaser each and every representation, warranty, covenant, agreement and
other obligation of Seller, and/or any of its permitted assigns under this
Agreement, and the full and timely performance of their respective obligations
under this Agreement (the " _Seller Guaranteed Obligations_ "). The
obligations of Beneficial Seller under this guarantee are continuing and will
remain in full force and effect until the Seller Guaranteed Obligations have
been performed or paid and satisfied in full.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 9.16(f)_, this is a guarantee of payment and
performance, and not of collection, and Beneficial Seller acknowledges and
agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional, and the obligations of
Beneficial Seller shall not be released, discharged, mitigated, impaired or
affected by (i) any lack or limitation of status or power, or other
such circumstance, including any dissolution, insolvency, bankruptcy,
liquidation, winding-up or other proceeding relating to Seller, Beneficial
Seller or any other Person, (ii) any irregularity, defect, unenforceability or
invalidity in respect of any obligations of Seller under this Agreement or
any other document or instrument contemplated hereby, (iii) any change in the
name, control, objects, business, assets, capital structure or constitution of
Seller, (iv) any right of set-off, counterclaim or defense of any kind (other
than payment and satisfaction in full of the Seller Guaranteed Obligations)
which Beneficial Seller, Seller or any other Person has or may have against
Purchaser, Parent or any of its Affiliates, (v) any extensions of time,
indulgences or modifications which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates may
extend to or make with Seller in respect of the performance of the Seller
Guaranteed Obligations, (vi) any amendment, variation, modification,
supplement or replacement of this Agreement or any other document or
instrument contemplated hereby (except to the extent that such amendment,
variation, modification, supplement or replacement affects the Seller
Guaranteed Obligations), (vii) the occurrence of any change in the Applicable
Laws of any jurisdiction or by any present or future action of any
Governmental Authority amending, varying, reducing or otherwise affecting, or
purporting to amend, vary, reduce or otherwise affect, any of the Seller
Guaranteed Obligations or the obligations of Beneficial Seller under this
guarantee and (viii) any other circumstance (other than payment and
satisfaction in full of the Seller Guaranteed Obligations) that might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of Seller under
this Agreement or of Beneficial Seller in respect of its obligations
hereunder.

 



-64- (c) Subject to _Section 9.16(f)_, Beneficial Seller hereby waives, for the
benefit of Purchaser, (i) any right to require Purchaser, as a condition of
performance by the Seller Guarantor, to proceed against Seller or pursue any
other remedy whatsoever and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by
Applicable Law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or
sureties.

(d) Beneficial Seller covenants and agrees to take all actions to enable
Seller to adhere to each provision of this Agreement which requires an act or
omission on the part of Beneficial Seller to enable Seller to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement.

(e) Beneficial Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser, as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing, that (i) Beneficial Seller has all requisite
power and authority and full legal capacity to enter into this Agreement and
the other agreements contemplated by this Agreement to be entered into by
Beneficial Seller and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) this Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of
Beneficial Seller, enforceable against Beneficial Seller in accordance with
its terms, and (iii) the execution and delivery by Beneficial Seller of this
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated by this Agreement to be
entered into by Beneficial Seller do not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance with the terms
hereof and thereof will not conflict with, or result in any violation of or
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under any Order applicable to Beneficial Seller, Seller,
the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets or any
Applicable Law applicable to Beneficial Seller, Seller, the Company or any
Subsidiary or their respective property or assets.

 

(f) Purchaser hereby agrees that it will, and it will cause the Purchaser
Indemnitees to, use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the payment of

ESCROW AGREEMENT

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of [
], 2014, by and among TriMas UK Aerospace Holdings Limited, a United Kingdom
limited company, as purchaser (" _Purchaser_ "), The James and Eleanor
Randall Trust Dated June 1, 1993, as seller (" _Seller_ ") (each, a " _Party_
" and together the " _Parties_ ") and Bank of America, National Association,
a national banking association duly organized and existing under the laws of
the United States of America, having an office in Chicago, Illinois (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ").

 

WHEREAS, on [ ], 2014, Purchaser, Seller, Allfast Fastening
Systems, Inc., a California corporation and, for purposes of certain
specified sections thereof, TriMas Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and
James H. Randall, entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the "
_Purchase Agreement_ "), and terms used but not defined herein have the
respective meanings assigned to them in the Purchase Agreement, a copy of
which has not been furnished to Escrow Agent but which the Parties agree to
furnish if notified by Escrow Agent that the Escrow Agent must reference
definitions contained therein in order to perform its responsibilities under
this Agreement.

WHEREAS, Section 1.4(c)(1) of the Purchase Agreement provides for the deposit
with the Escrow Agent of immediately available funds in the amount of the
Escrow Amount, to be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with
this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _ESTABLISHMENT OF ESCROW_

 

(a) At the Closing, Purchaser will deposit $7,140,000 with the Escrow Agent,
(as may be adjusted by disbursements in accordance with the terms hereof, the
" _Escrow Funds_ ").

(b) The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent hereby
agrees to serve, as the escrow agent and depositary subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein. The Escrow Agent shall receive the Escrow Funds
and agrees to hold the Escrow Funds in a separate and distinct account (the "
_Escrow Account_ ") which is hereby established and which will be held and
disbursed by the Escrow Agent only in accordance with the express terms and
conditions of this Agreement. ARTICLE II

 

 _INVESTMENT OF ESCROW FUND_

The Escrow Agent is hereby directed to invest the Escrow Fund, including
earnings thereon, in the Bank of America Institutional Deposit Account (a
money market deposit account) bearing internal identification number 999102031
(the " _IDA_ "). It is understood that the IDA bears interest at a fixed rate
of 3 basis points per annum. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that (i)
the IDA is a deposit account held at Bank of America, N.A., (ii) additional
information about the IDA is available upon request, (iii) funds deposited in
the IDA shall be insured to the maximum extent permitted by law and regulation
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, (iv) the IDA shall have a
normal cutoff time of 4:00PM (Central Time) and (v) any cash received after
that time shall not be invested until the next Business Day.

 

ARTICLE III

 

 _DISBURSEMENTS FROM THE ESCROW ACCOUNT_

 

3.1 The Escrow Agent shall only disburse amounts held in the Escrow Account
upon receipt of a joint written notice (" _Disbursement Request_ ") from the
Parties at least two (2) Business Days prior to the requested disbursement
date specifying (i) the amount to be disbursed, (ii) the date of disbursement,
(iii) the recipient of the disbursement, and (iv) the manner of disbursement
and delivery instructions. A form of Disbursement Request is attached hereto
as _Annex I_. For the avoidance of doubt, if any Disbursement Request
authorizes the disbursement of all of the then-remaining Escrow Funds,
such Disbursement Request shall constitute a Termination Notice (as defined
below) and shall be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of
_Article VI_. Further, the Escrow Agent is authorized to obtain confirmation
of such Disbursement Request by telephone call-back to the person or persons
designated for verifying such requests on _Exhibit B_ (such person verifying
the request shall be different than the person initiating the request). The
Escrow Agent is authorized to disinvest the requisite amount of Escrow Funds
one (1) Business Day prior to the requested disbursement date, or may do so
earlier if the Escrow Agent determines in its sole good faith discretion that
disinvesting more than one (1) Business Day prior to the disbursement date is
necessary in order to assure the availability of funds on the requested
disbursement date.

3.2 From time to time following execution of this Agreement, Purchaser may
deliver a Purchaser Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms of Section 7.7(b) of the Purchase Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
conclusively presume that any Purchaser Claim Notice delivered to it was
simultaneously delivered to Seller. Upon receipt of a Purchaser Claim Notice,
the Escrow Agent shall reserve the dollar amount of the Purchaser Indemnity
Claim identified in the Purchaser Claim Notice from (and only to the extent
of) the Escrow Funds. If the Seller delivers to the Escrow Agent a Dispute
Notice within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt by the Escrow Agent
of the Purchaser Claim Notice, then the Escrow Agent shall not pay any amount
of the Purchaser Indemnity Claim in the applicable Purchaser Claim Notice
until the Escrow Agent receives (i) a joint written instruction of the Parties
to make a payment or (ii) a final and non-appealable order, judgment
or decree ruling as to the disposition of the disputed Purchaser Indemnity
Claim of a court or arbiter of competent jurisdiction

 



\- 2 -  accompanied by a certificate of the Party delivering such order, judgment,
decree or arbitration award addressed to the Escrow Agent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Escrow Agent certifying that such order, judgment or
decree or award is the final and non-appealable ruling of a court or arbiter
of competent jurisdiction (a " _Final Order_ ") upon which Escrow Agent shall
conclusively rely; and in each case, Escrow Agent shall only pay amounts from
(and only to the extent of) the Escrow Funds. If no Dispute Notice is received
by the Escrow Agent within such 30-day period, then the dollar amount of the
Purchaser Indemnity Claim in the Purchaser Claim Notice shall be deemed
established for purposes of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement and, at
the end of such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Purchaser the
dollar amount of the Purchaser Indemnity Claim in the Purchaser Claim Notice
from (and only to the extent of) the Escrow Funds; _provided_ that the Escrow
Agent shall not pay such amount unless and until it shall have received a
joint written instruction of the Parties to make such payment. If a Dispute
Notice disputes only a portion of the amount of the Purchase Indemnity Claim
in the applicable Purchaser Claim Notice, then, reasonably promptly after the
delivery of such Dispute Notice, the Parties shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to the Purchaser the dollar amount of
the undisputed portion. The Escrow Agent shall not inquire into or consider
whether a Purchaser Indemnity Claim complies with the requirements of the
Purchase Agreement.

 

3.3 On the first Business Day following the 12 month anniversary of the
Closing Date (the " _Partial Release Date_ ") and upon receipt of
written notice from Seller that such Partial Release Date has occurred, the
Escrow Agent shall pay to an account designated in writing by Seller the
excess, if any, of (i) the then-remaining Escrow Funds over (ii) the sum of
$3,570,000 _plus_  the aggregate dollar amount of all unresolved Purchaser
Indemnity Claims for which Purchaser Claim Notices have been provided to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 3.2_ prior to the Partial Release
Date. Any amount of the Escrow Funds retained by the Escrow Agent after the
Partial Release Date shall be held subject to the terms of this Agreement. On
the first Business Day following the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " _Release Date_ ") and upon receipt of written notice from Seller that
such Release Date has occurred, the Escrow Agent shall pay to an account
designated in writing by Seller the excess, if any, of (a) the then-remaining
Escrow Funds over (b) the aggregate dollar amount of all unresolved Purchaser
Indemnity Claims for which Purchaser Claim Notices have been provided to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 3.2_ prior to the Release Date. Any
amount of the Escrow Funds retained by the Escrow Agent after the Release
Date shall be held subject to the terms of this Agreement until all unresolved
Purchaser Indemnity Claims have been resolved, at which point all remaining
amounts held in the Escrow Account shall be paid to an account designated in
a joint written instruction of the Parties or pursuant to a Final Order.

3.4 If the Escrow Funds are invested, any payment date will require an
additional Business Day thereafter to disinvest in accordance with _Section
3.1_. Also in accordance with _Section 3.1_, all other instructions to
disburse hereunder must specify items (i)  (iv) set forth in _Section 3.1_.

 



\- 3 - ARTICLE IV

 

 _COMPENSATION; EXPENSES_

 

As compensation for its services to be rendered under this Agreement, for each
year or any portion thereof, the Escrow Agent shall receive a fee in the
amount specified in _Exhibit A_ to this Agreement and shall be reimbursed upon
request for all expenses, disbursements and advances, including reasonable
fees of outside counsel, if any, incurred or made by it in connection with
the carrying out of its duties under this Agreement. Such fees and expenses
will be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller. The Parties are
severally and not jointly liable for the payment of such amounts. The Escrow
Agent is not authorized to withdraw any unpaid amounts from the Escrow Funds
and shall not have any other right of setoff against the Escrow Funds or the
Escrow Account. Amounts due for fees and expenses at the time this Agreement
is executed shall be deemed to have been invoiced at such time and for
purposes of this _Article IV_ shall be deemed an invoice.

ARTICLE V

 

 _EXCULPATION AND INDEMNIFICATION_

 

5.1 (a) The obligations and duties of the Escrow Agent are confined to those
specifically set forth in this Agreement which obligations and duties
shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature. No additional obligations and
duties of the Escrow Agent shall be inferred or implied from the terms of any
other documents or agreements, notwithstanding references herein to other
documents or agreements. In the event that any of the terms and provisions of
any other agreement between any of the parties hereto conflict or are
inconsistent with any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall govern and control the duties of the
Escrow Agent in all respects. The Escrow Agent shall not be subject to, or be
under any obligation to ascertain or construe the terms and conditions of any
other instrument, or to interpret this Agreement in light of any other
agreement whether or not now or hereafter deposited with or delivered to the
Escrow Agent or referred to in this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall not be
obligated to inquire as to the form, execution, sufficiency, or validity of
any such instrument nor to inquire as to the identity, authority, or rights
of the person or persons executing or delivering same. The Escrow Agent shall
have no duty to know or inquire as to the performance or nonperformance of any
provision of any other agreement, instrument, or document. The Parties shall
provide the Escrow Agent with a list of authorized representatives, initially
authorized hereunder as set forth on _Exhibit B_; as such _Exhibit B_ may be
amended or supplemented from time to time by delivery of a revised and re-
executed _Exhibit B_ to the Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, the Escrow Agent is authorized to comply with and rely upon any
notices, instructions or other communications believed by it to have been sent
or given by the Parties or by a person or persons authorized by the Parties.
The Escrow Agent specifically allows for receiving direction by written
or electronic transmission from an authorized representative in accordance
with the terms hereof with the following caveat, the Parties on a joint and
several basis agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent against
any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) (collectively, " _Losses_ ")
incurred or sustained by the Escrow Agent as a result of or in connection with
the Escrow Agents 

 



\- 4 -  reliance upon and compliance with instructions or directions given by
written or electronic transmission transmitted to each by such respective
party, provided, however, that such Losses have not arisen from the bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent, it being
understood that forbearance on the part of the Escrow Agent to verify or
confirm that the person giving the instructions or directions, is, in fact,
an authorized person shall not be deemed to constitute bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Escrow Agent shall not be entitled to satisfy any such indemnity
obligation from the Escrow Funds or the Escrow Account, and shall not
otherwise have any right of setoff against the Escrow Funds or the Escrow
Account.

(b) In the event funds transfer instructions are given to the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (other than with respect to fund
transfers to be made contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement),
regardless of the method used to transmit such instructions, such
instructions must be given by an individual designated on _Exhibit B_.
Further, the Escrow Agent is authorized to obtain and rely upon confirmation
of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or
persons designated for verifying such instructions on _Exhibit B_ (such
person verifying the instruction shall be different than the person initiating
the instruction). The Escrow Agent may require any Party which is entitled to
direct the delivery of fund transfers to designate a phone number or numbers
for purposes of confirming the requested transfer. The Parties agree that the
Escrow Agent may delay the initiation of any fund transfer until all security
measures it deems to be necessary and appropriate have been completed and
shall incur no liability for such delay.

5.2 The Escrow Account shall be maintained in accordance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations and policies and procedures of general
applicability to escrow accounts established by the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any act that it may do or omit to do hereunder
in good faith and in the exercise of its own best judgment or for any damages
not directly resulting from its bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, it is
hereby agreed that in no event will the Escrow Agent be liable for any lost
profits or other indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages which
the Parties may incur or experience by reason of having entered into or relied
on this Agreement or arising out of or in connection with the Escrow Agents
duties hereunder, notwithstanding that the Escrow Agent was advised or
otherwise made aware of the possibility of such damages. The Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for acts of God, acts of war, breakdowns or malfunctions
of machines or computers, interruptions or malfunctions of communications or
power supplies, labor difficulties, actions of public authorities, or any
other similar cause or catastrophe beyond the Escrow Agents reasonable
control. Any act done or omitted to be done by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
the advice of its attorneys shall be conclusively presumed to have been
performed or omitted in good faith by the Escrow Agent.

 

5.3 In the event the Escrow Agent is notified of any dispute, disagreement or
legal action relating to or arising in connection with the escrow, the
Escrow Funds, or the performance of the Escrow Agents duties under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy
or to take any action regarding it. The

 



\- 5 -  Escrow Agent may hold all documents and funds and may wait for settlement of
any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings, arbitration, or
other means as, in the Escrow Agents discretion, it may require.
Furthermore, if confronted with conflicting demands such that it determines in
good faith that it risks incurring expense or liability regardless of any
action it may take or refrain from taking, the Escrow Agent may, at its
option, file an action of interpleader requiring the Parties to answer and
litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is
authorized, at its option, to deposit with the court in which such action is
filed, all documents and funds held in escrow. All costs, expenses, charges,
and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the
interpleader action shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by
Seller. The Parties are severally and not jointly liable for the payment of
such amounts. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully
released and discharged of and from all subsequent obligations and liability
otherwise imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

 

5.4 The Parties hereby agree, on a joint and several basis, to indemnify and
hold the Escrow Agent, and its directors, officers, employees, and
agents, harmless from and against all costs, damages, judgments, attorneys
fees (whether such attorneys shall be regularly retained or specifically
employed), expenses, obligations and liabilities of every kind and nature
which the Escrow Agent, and its directors, officers, employees, and agents,
may incur, sustain, or be required to pay in connection with or arising out of
this Agreement, unless the aforementioned results from the Escrow Agents bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct, and to pay the Escrow Agent on
demand the amount of all such costs, damages, judgments, attorneys fees,
expenses, obligations, and liabilities. The indemnities under this section and
the costs and expenses of enforcing such right to indemnification will be
paid by Purchaser and Seller on a joint and several basis. Without limitation,
the foregoing indemnities shall extend to any breach of the representations,
warranties or covenants in _Section 9.4_ of this Agreement. The foregoing
indemnities in this paragraph shall survive the resignation or substitution of
the Escrow Agent and the termination of this Agreement.

 

5.5 (a) To the extent either Party is required to make any payment to the
Escrow Agent arising out of such Partys indemnification obligations under 
_Section 5.1_ or _Section 5.4_ (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), the other
Party (the " _Contributing Party_ ") agrees that promptly upon receiving
written notice from the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnifying Party is
required to make such payment to the Escrow Agent (the " _Contribution Notice_
"), which notice shall be accompanied by documentation evidencing such payment
obligation, the Contributing Party will promptly contribute and pay to the
Indemnifying Party, in cash in immediately available funds in U.S. dollars,
one-half of the aggregate amount required to be paid by the Indemnifying
Party; _provided_ that the Contributing Party shall not be obligated to
contribute or pay any amounts which arise solely based upon or directly arise
from the Indemnifying Partys bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

 

(b) All payments made pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall be made by wire
transfer in accordance with written instructions set forth in
the Contribution Notice.

 



\- 6 - (c) In the event that the Contributing Party fails to make a payment requested
by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ within five (5)
business days of receiving the Contribution Notice, in addition to the amounts
due pursuant to the provisions of _Section 5.5(a)_, interest on such amounts
due and owing will be payable by the Contributing Party to the Indemnifying
Party and shall accrue at a rate of interest equal to the seven (7) percent
per annum from the date of deemed receipt of such Contribution Notice as
determined pursuant to _Article VIII_ hereof through and including the date
payment of such amounts is actually received by the Indemnifying Party.

ARTICLE VI

 

 _TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT_

 

(a) This Agreement shall terminate on the termination date set forth in a
properly executed and delivered Termination Notice (as defined below). The
Parties may, at any time, terminate this Agreement by delivering to the Escrow
Agent written notice (the " _Termination Notice_ ") signed by the Parties
setting forth (i) the requested termination date and (ii) instructions for
payment of the remaining Escrow Funds to the Person or Persons designated in
such Termination Notice. The Termination Notice shall be received by the
Escrow Agent not fewer than two (2) Business Days prior to the requested
termination date. A form of Termination Notice is attached hereto as _Exhibit
C_.

(b) Should the Parties terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Article VI_
, it is understood and agreed by each of them that the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled (i) to keep any monies paid to it (other than monies constituting the
Escrow Fund) in respect of fees or expenses previously due and owing and (ii)
to offset from the amount of the Escrow Fund on deposit as of the date of the
Termination Notice, any amounts due for fees and expenses that, as of such
date, have been previously invoiced and which are then delinquent due to
nonpayment, provided, however, that such amount shall be offset, if and only
to the extent possible, from amounts which would otherwise be paid to the
Party or Parties responsible for paying the delinquent amounts. For
the avoidance of doubt, if monies would otherwise be paid to a Party upon
termination of this Agreement, and such Party is not responsible for the
delinquent amounts, then the Escrow Agent shall have no right of setoff
against that portion of the Escrow Fund that would be paid to such Party. The
Escrow Agent is authorized to disinvest the remaining Escrow Funds one (1)
Business Day prior to the requested date of termination set forth in the
Termination Notice, or may do so earlier if the Escrow Agent determines in
its sole good faith discretion that disinvesting more than one (1) Business
Day prior to the requested date is necessary in order to assure the
availability of funds on the requested termination date. Notwithstanding any
other provision hereof, this Agreement shall not terminate before all amounts
in the Escrow Account (including interest which has accrued but cannot be
distributed prior to being posted) shall have been distributed by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



\- 7 - ARTICLE VII

 

 _RESIGNATION OF ESCROW AGENT_

 

The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days
prior written notice to the Parties; _provided_ that no such resignation
shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent which
shall be accomplished as follows: the Parties shall use their best efforts to
select a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receiving such
notice. If the Parties fail to appoint a successor escrow agent within such
time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to petition any court of general
jurisdiction sitting in Cook County, Illinois for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent, and the costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys
fees which are incurred in connection with any such proceeding shall be paid
one-half by Purchaser and one-half by Seller. The Parties are severally and
not jointly liable for the payment of such amounts. The successor escrow
agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and
it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties,
rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally
named as escrow agent. Upon delivery of such instrument, the Escrow Agent
shall be discharged from any further duties and liability under this
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be paid any outstanding fees and
expenses prior to transferring assets to a successor escrow agent.

ARTICLE VIII

ARTICLE IX

 

 _TAX REPORTING_

9.1 The Escrow Agent shall, for each calendar year (or portion thereof) that
the Escrow Account is in existence, report the income of the Escrow Account
(i) to Seller, and (ii) to the IRS, as required by law. The parties to this
Agreement agree that they will not take any position in connection with the
preparation, filing or audit of any tax return that is in any way inconsistent
with the foregoing determination or the information returns or reports
provided by the Escrow Agent.

 

9.2 The Parties understand and agree that they are required to provide the
Escrow Agent with a properly completed and signed Tax Certification (as
defined below) and that the Escrow Agent may not perform its duties hereunder
without having been

 



\- 9 -  provided with such Tax Certification. Accordingly, the parties hereto other
than the Escrow Agent understand and agree that unless and until all parties
hereto have provided Tax Certifications to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow
Account shall not be invested as otherwise provided herein nor shall
disbursements be made from the Escrow Account as otherwise provided at
_Article III_. In the case of a person that is a "United States person"
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), an original IRS Form W-9 (or applicable
successor form) will be provided. In the case of a person that is not a
"United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code
(hereinafter a " _foreign person_ "), an original applicable IRS Form W-8ECI,
W-8IMY, W-8EXP or W-8BEN (or applicable successor form), along with any
required attachments, will be provided to the Escrow Agent. As used herein "
_Tax Certification_ " shall mean an IRS form W-9 or W-8 as described above.
Under current law, the applicable IRS Form W-8ECI, W-8IMY, W-8EXP or W-8BEN
generally will expire every three (3) years and must be replaced with another
properly completed and signed original sent to the Escrow Agent. A new
original IRS Form W-8, indicating the relevant Escrow Account number, (or such
other information or forms as required by law) must be delivered by each
foreign person to, and received by, the Escrow Agent either prior to December
31st of the calendar year inclusive of the third (3rd) anniversary date of the
date listed on the previously submitted form or as otherwise required by law.

9.3 The Escrow Agent will comply with any U.S. tax withholding or backup
withholding and reporting requirements that are required by law. With respect
to earnings allocable to a foreign person, the Escrow Agent will withhold U.S.
tax as required by law and report such earnings and taxes withheld, if any,
for the benefit of such foreign person on IRS Form 1042-S (or any other
required form), unless such earnings and withheld taxes are exempt from
reporting under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1461-1(c)(2)(ii) or under other
applicable law. With respect to earnings allocable to a United States person,
the Escrow Agent will report such income, if required, on IRS Form 1099 or any
other form required by law. The IRS Forms 1099 and/or 1042-S shall show the
Escrow Agent as payor and Seller as payee(s).

 

9.4 The Parties hereby (i) represent and warrant each for themselves that, as
of the date this Agreement is made and entered into, the Escrow Account
is not a Qualified Settlement Fund, Designated Settlement Fund, or Disputed
Ownership Fund within the meaning of Section 468B of the Code (and the
regulations thereunder) and (ii) covenant that they shall not take, fail to
take or permit to occur any action or inaction, on or after the date this
Agreement is made and entered into, that causes the Escrow Account to become
such a Qualified Settlement Fund, Designated Settlement Fund, or Disputed
Ownership Fund at any time.

 

9.5 The Parties to this Agreement agree that they are not relieved of their
respective obligations, if any, to prepare and file information reports
under Section 6041 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations thereunder, with
respect to amounts of imputed interest income, as determined pursuant to
Sections 483 or 1272 of the Code. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible
for determining or reporting such imputed interest.

 



\- 10 - ARTICLE X

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

10.1 Each party hereto represents and warrants that such party has all
necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
perform all of such partys obligations hereunder. This Agreement constitutes
the legal, valid, and binding obligation of each party hereto, enforceable
against such party in accordance with its respective terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally
and by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability
shall be considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

 

10.2 This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California,
excluding choice of law principles that would require the application of
the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of California. Any Proceeding
brought by any party or any of its Affiliates arising out of or based upon
this Agreement shall only be instituted in any federal or state court in New
York County, New York, and each party waives any objection which it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding, and
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit,
action or proceeding.

 

10.3 Any bank or corporation into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or with
which it may be consolidated, or any bank or corporation to whom the
Escrow Agent may transfer a substantial amount of its escrow business, shall
be the successor to the Escrow Agent without the execution or filing of any
paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties, anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding.

10.4 This Agreement may be amended, modified, and/or supplemented only by an
instrument in writing executed by all parties hereto.

 

10.5 This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto individually or in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of
which shall together constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement,
signed and transmitted by facsimile machine or PDF file, is to be treated as
an original document and the signature of any party hereon, if so transmitted,
is to be considered as an original signature, and the document so transmitted
is to be considered to have the same binding effect as a manually executed
original.

 

10.6 The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall
not constitute a part of this Agreement. Any references in this Agreement to
any other agreement, instrument, or document are for the convenience of the
parties hereto and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement.

10.7 As used in this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " means a day other than a
Saturday, Sunday, or other day when banking institutions in Los Angeles,
California, or Chicago, Illinois, are authorized or required by law or
executive order to be closed. 

 



\- 11 - 10.8 This Agreement constitutes a contract solely among the parties by which
it has been executed and is enforceable solely by the parties by which it has
been executed and no other persons. It is the intention of the parties hereto
that this Agreement may not be enforced on a third party beneficiary or any
similar basis.

 

10.9 The parties hereto agree that if any provision of this Agreement shall
under any circumstances be deemed invalid or inoperative this Agreement shall
be construed with the invalid or inoperative provisions deleted and the
rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced
accordingly.

 

10.10 No party hereto shall assign its rights hereunder until its assignee has
submitted to the Escrow Agent (i) Patriot Act disclosure materials and
the Escrow Agent has determined that on the basis of such materials it may
accept such assignee as a customer and (ii) assignee has delivered an IRS Form
W-8 or W-9, as appropriate, to the Escrow Agent which the Escrow Agent has
determined to have been properly signed and completed. In addition, the
foregoing rights to assign shall be subject, in the case of any party having
an obligation to indemnify the Escrow Agent, to the Escrow Agents approval
based upon the financial ability of assignee to indemnify it being reasonably
comparable to the financial ability of assignor, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

10.11 Escrow Agent will treat information related to this Agreement as
confidential but, unless prohibited by law, the Parties authorize the transfer
or disclosure of any information relating to the Agreement to and between the
subsidiaries, officers, affiliates and other representatives and advisors of
Escrow Agent and third parties selected by any of them, wherever situated, for
confidential use in the ordinary course of business, and further acknowledge
that Escrow Agent and any such subsidiary, officer, Affiliate or third party
may transfer or disclose any such information as required by any law, court,
regulator or legal process.

 

10.12 The Parties will treat the terms of this Agreement, including any Fee
Schedule, as confidential except on a "need to know" basis to persons within
or outside such Partys organization (including affiliates of such Party),
such as attorneys, accountants, bankers, financial advisors, auditors and
other consultants of such party and its affiliates, except as required by any
law, court, regulator or legal process and except pursuant to the express
prior written consent of the other parties, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 _INFORMATION AND DISCLOSURES REGARDING INVESTMENTS_

 

Institutional Deposit Account:

U.S and non U.S. Corporate and Institutional Investor Use Only

The Institutional Deposit Account is a Money Market Deposit Account held at
Bank of America, N.A. For more complete information about IDA, please refer
to the terms and conditions and fact sheet. You should read and review this
information carefully before investing. Past performance is no guarantee of
future results. Funds deposited in IDA are insured to the maximum extent
permitted by law and regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
IDA has a normal cutoff time of 4:00PM (central time) and any cash received
after that time will not be invested until the next business day. 

Repurchase Agreement Account:

U.S Corporate and Institutional Investor Use Only

The Repurchase Agreement Account ("RAA") is a Repurchase Agreement with Bank
of America, National Association ("Bank") and is available with the
establishment of an account with Global Custody and Agency Services, a
division of Bank acting on your behalf ("GCAS"). For more complete information
about RAA, please refer to the terms and conditions and fact sheet. You
should read and review this information carefully before investing. Past
performance is no guarantee of future results. Repurchase Agreements are not
deposits within the meaning of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.
1813(l)), are not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, the FDIC or
any other government agency, and involve investment risk, including possible
loss of principal. If a receiver were appointed for Bank of America, the
client would have an ownership interest in the securities sold to the client
that are described in the applicable trade confirmation received by GCAS on
behalf of all clients investing in RAA or, if the transaction were deemed to
be a loan, the client would be a secured creditor and have a perfected
interest in such securities. RAA has a normal cutoff time of 1:00PM (central
time) and any cash received after that time will not be invested until the
next business day.

 

Money Market Funds:

U.S Corporate and Institutional Investor Use Only

For more complete information about a money market fund listed in this _form_
, including expenses, investment objectives, and past performance, please
refer to the prospectus. You should read and review this information carefully
before investing. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Investments in money market mutual funds are neither insured nor guaranteed
by Bank of America, N.A. and its affiliates, or by any Government Agency.
There can be no assurance that the funds can maintain a stable net asset value
of $1.00 per share. Bank of America, N. A. typically has a normal cut-off
time of one hour prior to the money market mutual funds stated cut off time
and any cash received after that time will not be invested until the next
Business Day.

 

The parties to the agreement understand and agree that the Escrow Agent may
receive certain revenue associated with money market fund investments.
These revenues take one of two forms:

_Shareholder Servicing Payments_ : The Escrow Agent may receive shareholder
servicing payments commensurate with the shareholder services provided for
the money market fund company. Shareholder services typically provided by Bank
of America, N.A. include the maintenance of shareholder ownership records,
distributing prospectuses and other shareholder information materials to
investors and handling proxy-voting materials. Typically shareholder servicing
payments are paid under a money market funds 12b-1 distribution plan and
impact the investment performance of the fund by the amount of the fee.
The shareholder servicing fee payable from any money market fund is detailed
in the funds prospectus provided to you.

_Revenue Sharing Payments_ : The Escrow Agent may receive revenue sharing
payments from a money market fund company. These payments represent a
reallocation to the Escrow Agent of a portion of the compensation payable to
the fund company in connection with a money market fund investment. Revenue
sharing payments constitute a form of fee sharing between the fund company and
the Escrow Agent and do not, as a general rule, result in any additional
charge or expense in connection with a money market fund investment, are
not paid under a 12b-1 plan, and do not impact the investment performance of
the fund. The amount of any revenue share, if any, payable to the Escrow Agent
with respect to your accounts investments is available upon request.

 

In the event that a money market fund has been designated as the investment,
the parties hereto acknowledge delivery of the prospectus for such fund. The
Parties hereto acknowledge that money market funds and other non-deposit
investments are not deposits in or obligations of, or guaranteed by, Bank of
America Corporation or any of its affiliates and are not insured by the FDIC
or any government agency. Investments in money market funds involve
investment risks, including possible loss of principal.

Acknowledged and agreed to this day of , 20 :

Consultancy Services Agreement _Execution Version_

 

 _CONSULTANCY SERVICES AGREEMENT_

 

This Consultancy Services Agreement _("Agreement")_ is entered into as of
September 19, 2014, by and between Allfast Fastening Systems, Inc., a
California corporation (the " _Company_ "), and James H. Randall ("
_Consultant_ ").

 

Reference is made to that Stock Purchase Agreement (the " _Purchase Agreement_
"), dated as of even date herewith, by and among TriMas UK Aerospace Holdings
Limited, TriMas Corporation, the Company, the sole stockholder of the Company
and Consultant. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall
have the meanings given to them in the Purchase Agreement.

 

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement and other
good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Company and Consultant agree as follows:

1\. _Effective Date_. This Agreement will become automatically effective on
the date that both of the following conditions are satisfied (the " _Effective
Date_ "):



     | A. | The Company and Consultant execute this Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 



     | B. | The Closing occurs under the Purchase Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

2\. _Services_. The Company is retaining Consultant to provide certain
transitional services in connection with the transactions contemplated in the
Purchase Agreement (the " _Services_ "), which may include (a) assisting in
the development and execution of growth strategies with respect to the
Companys products; (b) providing knowledge and insight with respect to
competitor strengths and weaknesses; and (c) advising on matters relating to
(i) customers and customer relations, (ii) the capabilities of the Companys
management team, (iii) the Companys organizational structure, (iv) the
Companys compensation and benefits program, and (v) the transition and
integration of the Company following the Closing under the Purchase
Agreement. The Company may alter, expand and/or reduce the Services only upon
the mutual agreement of the parties.

 

3\. _Relationship of the Parties_.

 

(a) An independent contractor relationship shall exist between the Company and
Consultant. Consultant is neither an agent nor an employee of the Company.
Consultant has the authority to control and direct the performance of the
details of the Services, as governed by his own independent judgment and
discretion. In a manner that meets the business needs of the
Company, Consultant shall: (i) determine when, where, and how the Services
are performed; (ii) be responsible for hiring, training, assigning work to,
compensating, and supervising his own employees or agents; (iii) determine his
hours or days of work; (iv) determine the location from which the Services
are performed; (v) determine the order or sequence in which tasks are
performed related to the Services; and/or (vi) provide his own labor,
materials, equipment, tools, supplies, and other items necessary for
performing the Services in Consultants independent judgment and discretion;
_provided_ that Consultant shall be entitled to reimbursement from the  Company for any actual out-of-pocket costs related to such labor, materials,
equipment, tools, supplies and other items that are incurred by Consultant in
performing the Services. For purposes of clarity, the Company shall reimburse
Consultant for any actual out-of-pocket travel costs incurred by Consultant in
performing the Services, including direct operating costs of Consultants
business jet used for travel requested by the Company. 

(b) During the Term of this Agreement, the Company grants Consultant the right
to use the office that he occupied immediately prior to the Effective Date
located at 15200 Don Julian Road, City of Industry, California, 91745. The
Company agrees to maintain such office for Consultants sole use during the
Term (defined in _Section 5_ below) of this Agreement, and, whether or not
this Agreement is terminated, in any case for at least ninety (90) days
following the Effective Date (other than pursuant to Section 5(b)) (to allow
Consultant an opportunity to move, transition or otherwise transport any
Personal Property that remains in such office).

(c) During the Term of this Agreement (and in any event, for a period of at
least ninety (90) days after the Effective Date), the Company shall give
Consultant access to the Companys email systems and the right to continued
use of the Company email address utilized by Consultant prior to
the Effective Date. Following such time, the Company agrees to forward all
personal emails unrelated to the Companys business delivered to such account
to the email address provided for Consultant under _Section 12_ for a period
of one (1) year.

(d) Consultant shall not: (i) be required to undergo training of any nature,
including the training the Company provides its employees, except to the
extent required by the Companys safety policies; (ii) have any right or
authority to make any contracts or commitments for, or on behalf of, the
Company; and/or (iii) represent himself to be an employee or agent of the
Company.

(e) The Company does not agree to use Consultant exclusively. Consultant is
not exclusively engaged by the Company and remains free to perform services
for other persons and entities, and to make himself available to the public
for such purposes, subject to _Sections 6_ and _7_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Consultant
agrees to comply at all times with the Companys Code of Conduct and all
other Company policies (or those of its ultimate parent company TriMas
Corporation (" _TriMas_ ")) applicable to Consultant, each of which have been
made available to Consultant and are incorporated by reference herein. The
policies may be amended from time to time at the sole discretion of the
Company or TriMas.

 

(g) During and following the Term of this Agreement, Consultant shall be
entitled to remove any personal property of Consultant that is located at or
on the Companys premises, including any personal property identified on
Section 3.8(a) of the Disclosure Schedule that is not removed by Consultant at
or prior to Closing.

 



2 (h) Consultant shall perform the Services at the direction of the President
of the Company.

(i) From the Effective Date until the later of (i) ninety (90) days after the
Effective Date or (ii) the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall
use its best efforts make Kathi Baca, Anna Harding and Michael Rawlings
available to continue providing secretarial, administrative and accounting
support services to Consultant substantially similar to the secretarial,
administrative and accounting support services that such individuals provided
to Consultant prior to the Effective Date. Thereafter, so long as the
Agreement remains in effect, the Company shall select a person or persons at
their discretion to continue providing Consultant with secretarial,
administrative and accounting support services reasonably necessary to allow
Consultant to deliver the Services; _provided_ that such
secretarial, administrative and accounting support services shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Consultant.

4\. _Compensation_. In return for all Services provided by Consultant, the
Company shall pay Consultant, in advance on the first day of each month during
which this Agreement remains in effect, a payment of $15,000, which shall
compensate Consultant for his services during that month, regardless of the
number of hours worked by Consultant during that month. Consultant agrees that
he will make himself available to provide the Services hereunder for at least
twenty (20) hours, but not more than forty (40) hours, in each month during
the Term of this Agreement; _provided_ that Consultant shall not be obligated
to make himself so available for more than ten (10) hours in any week during
such time. The Company will issue an IRS Form 1099 to Consultant for all
compensation paid under this Agreement. Consultant shall be responsible for
paying any taxes related to this compensation, and Consultant shall indemnify
and hold the Company harmless from any tax liability, penalties and/or
interest relating to this compensation.

5\. _Term_. The " _Term_ " of this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date
and shall continue until the earliest of: (a) the first anniversary of the
Effective Date; (b) a breach by Consultant of either this Agreement or the
Purchase Agreement, at which time this Agreement may be terminated immediately
by Company (at Companys sole discretion) upon written notice; or (c) the
date this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Consultant upon
thirty (30) days written notice. Upon termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall only be obligated to provide the compensation set forth above
accrued through Consultants last day worked. Such compensation shall accrue
on the first day of each month during the Term.

 

6\. _Conflicts of Interest_. During the Term of this Agreement, Consultant
shall not, directly or indirectly:

 

(a) participate in any way in the benefits of transactions between the Company
(or an Affiliate of the Company) and its suppliers or customers, or have
personal financial transactions with any of the Companys suppliers or
customers, including without limitation, having a financial interest in the
Companys suppliers or customers, or making loans to, or receiving loans
from, the Companys suppliers or customers;

 



3 (b) realize a personal gain or advantage from a transaction in which the
Company (or an Affiliate) has an interest, or use information obtained in
connection with Consultants engagement with the Company for Consultants
personal advantage or gain; or

 

(c) accept any offer to serve as an officer, director, partner, consultant,
agent or manager with, or to be employed in a sales, managerial or technical
capacity by, a person or entity, which does business with the Company or an
Affiliate of the Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_ " shall mean with
respect to any person, any other person which Controls, is Controlled by or
under common Control with such person. " _Control_ " shall mean the ability to
direct the management of any entity whether through the ownership of voting
securities, contract or otherwise.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein but subject to
Section 15 of the Purchase Agreement, the provisions of this _Section 6_
shall not prohibit Consultant from engaging in any transaction with a member
of his immediate family if not a part of the conduct of the business of the
Company.

7\. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Consultant acknowledges that, during his engagement, he will have access
to and use the Companys Proprietary Information (as defined below) and
confidential Customer Information (as defined below). Consultant further
acknowledges that the Companys Proprietary Information was or will be
designed and developed by the Company or any Affiliate with considerable
effort and at great expense, is unique, secret and confidential, and
constitutes the exclusive property and trade secrets of the Company or such
Affiliate. Consultant further acknowledges that an integral part of the
Companys business involves the receipt of confidential Customer Information.
Consultant further acknowledges that any unauthorized use of the Proprietary
Information or Customer Information by Consultant, or any disclosure of the
same to any third parties, would be wrongful and would cause irreparable
injury to the Company, its customers, suppliers, employees, clients and/or
Affiliates.

 

(b) Accordingly, in addition to any confidentiality obligations set forth in
the Purchase Agreement, Consultant covenants and agrees that during the Term
of this Agreement and an additional period of three (3) years after
Consultants engagement by the Company is terminated, he will (i) hold the
Proprietary Information and Customer Information in strictest confidence;
(ii) not disclose such information to any person, firm, corporation or other
entity; and (iii) not use such information for any purpose not expressly
authorized in writing by the Company. Consultant also agrees that,
upon request of the Company, he will return all Company documents and
property in his possession or under his control, including but not limited to
business records in any way relating to the Company or its business, its
Proprietary Information or Customer Information (without retaining copies of
any of the foregoing). Consultant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company
harmless from any loss, claim or damages, including attorneys fees and costs,
arising out of or relating to Consultants unauthorized disclosure or use of
the Companys Proprietary Information or Customer Information.

 



4 (c) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Customer Information_ "
shall mean, whether verbal, written or stored electronically, (i) confidential
product or technology information of any customer of the Company, as indicated
by such customer; (ii) confidential information regarding the business of any
customer or its clients learned in the course of providing service and/or
products to the customer on behalf of the Company; (iii) other confidential
information submitted from time to time by a customer to the Company;
and (iv) the identity of the customer as the source of such data or
information provided to Consultant by the Company. Customer Information shall
in all events, however, exclude information that is generally available to or
known by the public. 

(d) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Proprietary Information_ "
shall mean, whether verbal, written or stored electronically, all customer
lists, prospective customer lists, trade secrets, databases, processes,
computer programs, software, object codes, source codes, passwords, entry
codes, inventions, improvements, business data, prospective employee lists,
business contact information of the Company or developed for the Company or
any of the Companys Affiliates or customers, information relating to the
Companys or any of its Affiliates business contracts, marketing strategies,
any other secret or confidential matter relating or pertaining to the
products, services, sales or other business of the Company, or any Affiliate,
and shall include Customer Information that was developed or enhanced by
the Company or any Affiliate including data furnished by or on behalf of the
customer. Proprietary Information shall in all events, however, exclude
information that is (i) generally available to or known by the public; (iii)
is or becomes available to the Consultant on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Company; or (iv) has been independently acquired or
developed by the Consultant without violating any of its obligations under
this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the term "
_Customer Information_ " nor the term " _Proprietary Information_ " shall
include information that Consultant is required to disclose under law, rule,
regulation, order or in any civil, governmental, regulatory or judicial
process, and nothing herein shall restrict Consultant from complying with
such request or requirement, _provided_ , _however_ , that Consultant shall
give the Company notice of such request or requirement prior to making any
disclosure thereunder (in each case, as is practicable and not prohibited by
law) so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order, at its sole
cost and expense, and/or, in its sole discretion, waive compliance by
Consultant with the applicable provisions of this _Section 7(e)_.

 

8\. _Return of Documents_. Upon termination of Consultants engagement with
the Company for any reason, all documents, procedural manuals, guides,
specifications, plans, drawings, diskettes, designs, software and similar
materials, diaries, records, customer lists, notebooks, and similar
repositories of or containing Proprietary Information, or Customer
Information, including all copies thereof, in the possession or control of
Consultant, whether prepared by Consultant or others, shall be left with, or
forthwith returned by Consultant to, the Company.

 



5 9\. _Inventions_.

 

(a) Any and all improvements, discoveries, innovations, invention conceptions
and/or reductions to practice, problem solutions and, in general, all
technological conceptions and developments, which relate to the Companys
business (hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Inventions_ ") at the
request of the Company or in connection with the delivery of the Services
contemplated hereunder, either alone or with others, during the Term of this
Agreement, are understood and agreed to be, and are by this Agreement
expressly made to be the exclusive property of the Company and shall be deemed
to be " _works made for hire_."

(b) Consultant shall disclose promptly and fully to the Company and to
its attorneys all Inventions, and shall, when requested so to do either
before or after the termination of his engagement with the Company, formally
assign and convey to the Company his entire right, title and interest in and
to all Inventions; assist the Company and its agents in preparing patent
applications, both United States and foreign, covering any Invention; promptly
review, execute and deliver all said applications and assignments of the same
to the Company, and as promptly as reasonably possible, generally give all
information and testimony, sign all papers and do all things which may be
needed or requested by the Company, to the end that the Company may obtain,
extend, reissue, maintain and enforce United States and foreign patents
covering said Inventions.

10\. _Company s Remedies_.

 

(a) Consultant acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and undertakings
contained in _Sections 6_ , _7_ , _8_  and _9_ of this Agreement relate to
matters which are of a special, unique, extraordinary, managerial and
intellectual character which gives them a peculiar value, and that a violation
of any of the terms of such Sections will cause irreparable injury to the
Company, the amount of which will be difficult, if not impossible, to estimate
or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Therefore, Consultant
agrees that the Company, in addition to any other available remedies
under applicable law, shall be entitled, as a matter of course, to an
injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from any court of
competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or threatened violation of
any such terms by Consultant and such other persons as the court shall order,
without being required to post any bond.

(b) Consultant agrees that the restrictions contained in _Sections 6_ , _7_ ,
_8_ and _9_ of this Agreement are reasonable in all respects and are to be
interpreted in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at the time
enforcement is sought. However, should any court or other body of competent
jurisdiction determine that all or any portion of the agreement set forth
herein is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such agreement (or portion
thereof) shall be restricted and deemed amended to the minimum extent
necessary so as to preserve and establish its validity and enforceability.

(c) Termination of Consultants engagement under this Agreement, by either
the Company or Consultant, or expiration of this Agreement, shall not affect
either partys rights and obligations under _Sections 6_ , _7_ , _8_ , _9_ and
_10_  of this Agreement, and such rights and obligations shall continue and
survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 



6 11\. _Assignment_. The Company shall not be required to make any payment under
this Agreement to any assignee or creditor of Consultant, other than to
Consultants legal representative on death. Consultants obligations under
this Agreement are personal and may not be assigned, delegated or transferred
in any manner and any attempt to do so shall be void. Consultant, or his
legal representative, shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise
to assign or otherwise dispose of any right of Consultant under this
Agreement. The Company may assign this Agreement without Consultants written
consent to any successor to or purchaser of the Companys business or any
portion thereof. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the
benefit of, the Company, Consultant and their permitted successors and
assigns.

12\. _Notices_. Any notice required or permitted to be given under this
Agreement must be in writing and shall be deemed conclusively to have been
delivered (a) when personally delivered; (b) when sent by facsimile or email
(in each case with a hard copy to follow) during a business day (or on the

of the Companys business involves the receipt of confidential Customer
Information (as defined below). Employee further acknowledges that

Employees possession or control in any way relating to the Company or its

including attorneys fees and costs, arising out of or relating to Employees
unauthorized disclosure and use of the Companys Proprietary Information or

Employee by any customer of the Company after Employees termination of
employment provided that before such disclosure was made such customer knew
that Employee was no longer employed by the Company.

 



6 (d) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Proprietary Information_ "
shall mean, whether verbal, written or stored electronically, all customer
lists, prospective customer lists, trade secrets, databases, processes,

materials, diaries, records, customer lists, notebooks, and similar
repositories of or containing Proprietary Information, or Customer
Information, including all copies thereof, then in Employees possession or
control, whether prepared by Employee or others, shall be left with, or
forthwith returned by Employee to, the Company.

employment for any reason, Employee will not directly or indirectly interfere
with the Companys business by hiring, raiding or soliciting any of the
Companys employees to terminate their employment, or disrupt the
relationship between the Company and any of its consultants, agents,
representatives or vendors; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction
shall not prohibit any such activities conducted in connection with
generalized solicitations not specifically directed at the Company or its
respective employees. Employee acknowledges that this covenant is necessary to
enable the Company to maintain a stable workforce and remain in business.

12\. _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Employee agrees that upon conception and/or development of any idea,
discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other material or
design that: (i) relates to the business of the Company, or (ii) relates to
the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or
(iii) results from any work performed by Employee for the Company, Employee
will assign to the Company the entire right, title and interest in and to any
such idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material or design.

 

(b) Employee has no obligation to assign any idea, discovery, invention,
improvement, software, writing or other material or design that Employee
conceives and/or develops entirely on Employees own time without using the
Companys equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information unless
the idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or
other material or design: (i) relates to the business of the Company, (ii)
relates to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or
development, or (iii) results from any work performed by Employee for the
Company.

 

(c) Employee agrees that any idea, discovery, invention, improvement,
software, writing or other material or design that relates to the business of
the Company or relates to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated
research or development which is conceived or suggested by Employee, either
solely or jointly with others, within one (1) year following termination
of Employees employment shall be presumed to have been so made, conceived or
suggested in the course of such employment with the use of the Companys
equipment, supplies, facilities, and/or trade secrets.

 

(d) In order to determine Employees rights and the rights of the Company in
any idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material, and to insure the protection of the same, Employee agrees that
during Employees employment, and for one (1) year after the termination of
Employees employment, Employee will disclose immediately and fully to the
Company any idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or
other material or design conceived, made or developed by Employee solely or
jointly with others. The Company agrees to keep any such disclosures
confidential. Employee also agrees to record descriptions of all work in the
manner directed by the Company, and Employee agrees that all such records and
copies, samples and experimental materials will be the exclusive property of
the Company.

 



8 (e) Employee agrees that at the request of and without charge to the Company,
but at the Companys expense, Employee will execute a written assignment of
the idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material or design to the Company and will assign to the Company any
application for letters patent or for trademark registration made thereon,
and to any common-law or statutory copyright therein; and Employee will do
whatever may be necessary or desirable to enable the Company to secure any
patent, trademark, copyright, or other property right therein in the United
States of America and in any foreign country, and any division, renewal,
continuation, or continuation in part thereof, or for any reissue of any
patent issues thereon.

 

(f) In the event the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, and in any
event after ten business days, to secure Employees signature on a written
assignment to the Company of any application for letters patent or to any
common-law statutory copyright or other property right therein, whether
because of Employees physical or mental incapacity or for any other
reason whatsoever, Employee irrevocably designates and appoints the President
of the Company as Employees attorney-in-fact to act on Employees behalf to
execute and file any such application and to do all other lawfully permitted
acts to further the prosecution and issuance of such letters patent,
copyright or trademark.

13\. _Company s Remedies_.

 

(a) Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and undertakings
contained in _Sections 7_ , _8_ , _9_ , _10_ ,  _11_ and _12_ of this
Agreement relate to matters which are of a special, unique, extraordinary,
managerial and intellectual character which gives them a peculiar value and
that a violation of any of the terms of such Sections will cause irreparable
injury to the Company, the amount of which will be difficult, if not
impossible, to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated. Therefore, Employee agrees that the Company, in addition to any
other available remedies under applicable law, shall be entitled, as a matter
of course, to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from
any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or threatened
violation of any such terms by Employee and such other persons as the court
shall order.

(b) Employee agrees that the restrictions contained in _Sections 7_ ,  _8_ ,
_9_ , _10_ , _11_ and _12_ are reasonable in all respects and are to be
interpreted in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at the time
enforcement is sought. However, should any court or other body of competent
jurisdiction determine that all or any portion of the agreements set forth
herein is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such agreement (or portion
thereof) shall be restricted and deemed amended to the minimum extent
necessary so as to preserve and establish its validity and enforceability.

14\. _Employee s Remedies_. Employees sole remedy against the Company for
breach of this Agreement is the collection of any compensation and benefits
due to Employee as provided in _Section 6_.

 



9 15\. _Assignment_. The Company shall not be required to make any payment under
this Agreement to any assignee or creditor of Employee, other than to
Employees legal representative on death. Employees obligations under this
Agreement are personal and may not be assigned, delegated or transferred in
any manner and any attempt to do so shall be void. Employee, or Employees
legal representative, shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise
to assign or otherwise dispose of any right of Employee under this Agreement.
The Company may assign this Agreement without Employees written consent to
any successor to the Companys business or any portion thereof. This Agreement
shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Company,
Employee and their permitted successors and assigns.

 

16\. _Company s Obligations Unfunded_. Except for any benefits under any
benefit plan of the Company that are required by law or by express agreement
to be funded, it is understood that the Companys obligations under this
Agreement are not funded, and it is agreed that the Company shall not be
required to set aside or escrow any monies in advance of the due date of
the payment of such monies to Employee.

17\. _Withholding_. The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any salary,
bonus, benefits, or other compensation payable to Employee hereunder such
amounts as it is required or authorized to withhold under applicable laws.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not

payment.

Agreement must be in writing and shall be deemed conclusively to have been

control, whether prepared by Employee or others, shall be left with, or

any idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material, and to insure the protection of the same, Employee agrees that
during Employees employment, and for one (1) year after the termination of
Employees employment, Employee will disclose immediately and fully to the
Company any idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or
other material or design conceived, made or developed by Employee solely or
jointly with others. The Company agrees to keep any such disclosures
confidential. Employee also agrees to record descriptions of all work in the
manner directed by the Company, and Employee agrees that all such records and
copies, samples and experimental materials will be the exclusive property of
the Company.

 



8 (e) Employee agrees that at the request of and without charge to the Company,
but at the Companys expense, Employee will execute a written assignment of
the idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material or design to the Company and will assign to the Company any
application for letters patent or for trademark registration made thereon,
and to any common-law or statutory copyright therein; and Employee will do
whatever may be necessary or desirable to enable the Company to secure any
patent, trademark, copyright, or other property right therein in the United
States of America and in any foreign country, and any division, renewal,
continuation, or continuation in part thereof, or for any reissue of any
patent issues thereon.

 

(f) In the event the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, and in any
event after ten business days, to secure Employees signature on a written
assignment to the Company of any application for letters patent or to any
common-law statutory copyright or other property right therein, whether
because of Employees physical or mental incapacity or for any other
reason whatsoever, Employee irrevocably designates and appoints the President
of the Company as Employees attorney-in-fact to act on Employees behalf to
execute and file any such application and to do all other lawfully permitted
acts to further the prosecution and issuance of such letters patent,
copyright or trademark.

13\. _Company s Remedies_.

 

(a) Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and undertakings
contained in _Sections 7_ , _8_ , _9_ , _10_ ,  _11_ and _12_ of this
Agreement relate to matters which are of a special, unique, extraordinary,
managerial and intellectual character which gives them a peculiar value and
that a violation of any of the terms of such Sections will cause irreparable
injury to the Company, the amount of which will be difficult, if not
impossible, to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated. Therefore, Employee agrees that the Company, in addition to any
other available remedies under applicable law, shall be entitled, as a matter
of course, to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from
any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or threatened
violation of any such terms by Employee and such other persons as the court
shall order.

(b) Employee agrees that the restrictions contained in _Sections 7_ ,  _8_ ,
_9_ , _10_ , _11_ and _12_ are reasonable in all respects and are to be
interpreted in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at the time
enforcement is sought. However, should any court or other body of competent
jurisdiction determine that all or any portion of the agreements set forth
herein is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such agreement (or portion
thereof) shall be restricted and deemed amended to the minimum extent
necessary so as to preserve and establish its validity and enforceability.

14\. _Employee s Remedies_. Employees sole remedy against the Company for
breach of this Agreement is the collection of any compensation and benefits
due to Employee as provided in _Section 6_.

 



9 15\. _Assignment_. The Company shall not be required to make any payment under

any manner and any attempt to do so shall be void. Employee, or Employees
legal representative, shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise
to assign or otherwise dispose of any right of Employee under this Agreement.
The Company may assign this Agreement without Employees written consent to
any successor to the Companys business or any portion thereof. This Agreement
shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Company,
Employee and their permitted successors and assigns.

 

16\. _Company s Obligations Unfunded_. Except for any benefits under any
benefit plan of the Company that are required by law or by express agreement
to be funded, it is understood that the Companys obligations under this
Agreement are not funded, and it is agreed that the Company shall not be
required to set aside or escrow any monies in advance of the due date of
the payment of such monies to Employee.

17\. _Withholding_. The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any salary,
bonus, benefits, or other compensation payable to Employee hereunder such
amounts as it is required or authorized to withhold under applicable laws.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not
be obligated to guarantee any particular tax result for Employee with respect
to any payment provided to Employee hereunder, and Employee shall be
responsible for any taxes imposed on Employee with respect to any such
payment.

Agreement must be in writing and shall be deemed conclusively to have been

Employee by any customer of the Company after Employees termination of
employment provided that before such disclosure was made such customer knew
that Employee was no longer employed by the Company.

 



6 (d) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Proprietary Information_ "
shall mean, whether verbal, written or stored electronically, all customer
lists, prospective customer lists, trade secrets, databases, processes,

repositories of or containing Proprietary Information, or Customer
Information, including all copies thereof, then in Employees possession or
control, whether prepared by Employee or others, shall be left with, or
forthwith returned by Employee to, the Company.

employment for any reason, Employee will not directly or indirectly interfere
with the Companys business by hiring, raiding or soliciting any of the
Companys employees to terminate their employment, or disrupt the
relationship between the Company and any of its consultants, agents,
representatives or vendors; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction
shall not prohibit any such activities conducted in connection with
generalized solicitations not specifically directed at the Company or its
respective employees. Employee acknowledges that this covenant is necessary to
enable the Company to maintain a stable workforce and remain in business.

12\. _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Employee agrees that upon conception and/or development of any idea,
discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other material or
design that: (i) relates to the business of the Company, or (ii) relates to
the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or
(iii) results from any work performed by Employee for the Company, Employee
will assign to the Company the entire right, title and interest in and to any
such idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material or design.

 

(b) Employee has no obligation to assign any idea, discovery, invention,
improvement, software, writing or other material or design that Employee
conceives and/or develops entirely on Employees own time without using the
Companys equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information unless
the idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or
other material or design: (i) relates to the business of the Company, (ii)
relates to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or
development, or (iii) results from any work performed by Employee for the
Company.

 

(c) Employee agrees that any idea, discovery, invention, improvement,
software, writing or other material or design that relates to the business of
the Company or relates to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated
research or development which is conceived or suggested by Employee, either
solely or jointly with others, within one (1) year following termination
of Employees employment shall be presumed to have been so made, conceived or
suggested in the course of such employment with the use of the Companys
equipment, supplies, facilities, and/or trade secrets.

 

(d) In order to determine Employees rights and the rights of the Company in
any idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material, and to insure the protection of the same, Employee agrees that
during Employees employment, and for one (1) year after the termination of
Employees employment, Employee will disclose immediately and fully to the
Company any idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or
other material or design conceived, made or developed by Employee solely or
jointly with others. The Company agrees to keep any such disclosures
confidential. Employee also agrees to record descriptions of all work in the
manner directed by the Company, and Employee agrees that all such records and
copies, samples and experimental materials will be the exclusive property of
the Company.

 



8 (e) Employee agrees that at the request of and without charge to the Company,
but at the Companys expense, Employee will execute a written assignment of
the idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material or design to the Company and will assign to the Company any
application for letters patent or for trademark registration made thereon,
and to any common-law or statutory copyright therein; and Employee will do
whatever may be necessary or desirable to enable the Company to secure any
patent, trademark, copyright, or other property right therein in the United
States of America and in any foreign country, and any division, renewal,
continuation, or continuation in part thereof, or for any reissue of any
patent issues thereon.

 

(f) In the event the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, and in any
event after ten business days, to secure Employees signature on a written
assignment to the Company of any application for letters patent or to any
common-law statutory copyright or other property right therein, whether
because of Employees physical or mental incapacity or for any other
reason whatsoever, Employee irrevocably designates and appoints the President
of the Company as Employees attorney-in-fact to act on Employees behalf to
execute and file any such application and to do all other lawfully permitted
acts to further the prosecution and issuance of such letters patent,
copyright or trademark.

contained in _Sections 7_ , _8_ , _9_ , _10_ ,  _11_ and _12_ of this
Agreement relate to matters which are of a special, unique, extraordinary,
managerial and intellectual character which gives them a peculiar value and
that a violation of any of the terms of such Sections will cause irreparable
injury to the Company, the amount of which will be difficult, if not
impossible, to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated. Therefore, Employee agrees that the Company, in addition to any
other available remedies under applicable law, shall be entitled, as a matter
of course, to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from
any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or threatened
violation of any such terms by Employee and such other persons as the court
shall order.

_9_ , _10_ , _11_ and _12_ are reasonable in all respects and are to be
interpreted in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at the time
enforcement is sought. However, should any court or other body of competent
jurisdiction determine that all or any portion of the agreements set forth
herein is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such agreement (or portion
thereof) shall be restricted and deemed amended to the minimum extent
necessary so as to preserve and establish its validity and enforceability.

confidential, and constitutes the exclusive property and trade secrets of the
Company or such Affiliate. Employee further acknowledges that an integral part
of the Companys business involves the receipt of confidential Customer
Information (as defined below). Employee further acknowledges that
any unauthorized use of the Proprietary Information or Customer Information
by Employee, or any disclosure of the same to any third parties, would be
wrongful and would cause irreparable injury to the Company, its customers,
suppliers, employees, clients and/or Affiliates.

generalized solicitations not specifically directed at the Company or its
respective employees. Employee acknowledges that this covenant is necessary to
enable the Company to maintain a stable workforce and remain in business.

12\. _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Employee agrees that upon conception and/or development of any idea,
discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other material or
design that: (i) relates to the business of the Company, or (ii) relates to
the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or
(iii) results from any work performed by Employee for the Company, Employee
will assign to the Company the entire right, title and interest in and to any
such idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material or design.

 

(b) Employee has no obligation to assign any idea, discovery, invention,
improvement, software, writing or other material or design that Employee
conceives and/or develops entirely on Employees own time without using the
Companys equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information unless
the idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or
other material or design: (i) relates to the business of the Company, (ii)
relates to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or
development, or (iii) results from any work performed by Employee for the
Company.

software, writing or other material or design that relates to the business of
the Company or relates to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated
research or development which is conceived or suggested by Employee, either
solely or jointly with others, within one (1) year following termination
of Employees employment shall be presumed to have been so made, conceived or
suggested in the course of such employment with the use of the Companys
equipment, supplies, facilities, and/or trade secrets.

 

(d) In order to determine Employees rights and the rights of the Company in
any idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material, and to insure the protection of the same, Employee agrees that
during Employees employment, and for one (1) year after the termination of
Employees employment, Employee will disclose immediately and fully to the
Company any idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or
other material or design conceived, made or developed by Employee solely or
jointly with others. The Company agrees to keep any such disclosures
confidential. Employee also agrees to record descriptions of all work in the
manner directed by the Company, and Employee agrees that all such records and
copies, samples and experimental materials will be the exclusive property of
the Company.

 



8 (e) Employee agrees that at the request of and without charge to the Company,
but at the Companys expense, Employee will execute a written assignment of
the idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other

application for letters patent or for trademark registration made thereon,
and to any common-law or statutory copyright therein; and Employee will do
whatever may be necessary or desirable to enable the Company to secure any
patent, trademark, copyright, or other property right therein in the United

patent issues thereon.

event after ten business days, to secure Employees signature on a written
assignment to the Company of any application for letters patent or to any
common-law statutory copyright or other property right therein, whether
because of Employees physical or mental incapacity or for any other
reason whatsoever, Employee irrevocably designates and appoints the President
of the Company as Employees attorney-in-fact to act on Employees behalf to
execute and file any such application and to do all other lawfully permitted
acts to further the prosecution and issuance of such letters patent,
copyright or trademark.

contained in _Sections 7_ , _8_ , _9_ , _10_ ,  _11_ and _12_ of this
Agreement relate to matters which are of a special, unique, extraordinary,
managerial and intellectual character which gives them a peculiar value and
that a violation of any of the terms of such Sections will cause irreparable
injury to the Company, the amount of which will be difficult, if not
impossible, to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated. Therefore, Employee agrees that the Company, in addition to any
other available remedies under applicable law, shall be entitled, as a matter
of course, to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from
any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or threatened
violation of any such terms by Employee and such other persons as the court

_9_ , _10_ , _11_ and _12_ are reasonable in all respects and are to be

enforcement is sought. However, should any court or other body of competent
jurisdiction determine that all or any portion of the agreements set forth
herein is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such agreement (or portion
thereof) shall be restricted and deemed amended to the minimum extent
necessary so as to preserve and establish its validity and enforceability.

months after the Effective Date or (B) the date on which Employee becomes

(c) Termination of Employees employment under this Agreement, by either the

rights and obligations shall continue and survive the termination of
Employees employment under this Agreement or expiration of this Agreement.

not, directly or indirectly:

(a) participate in any way in the benefits of transactions between the

(as defined below) was or will be designed and developed by the Company or any
Affiliate with considerable effort and at great expense, is unique, secret and
confidential, and constitutes the exclusive property and trade secrets of the
Company or such Affiliate. Employee further acknowledges that an integral part
of the Companys business involves the receipt of confidential Customer
Information (as defined below). Employee further acknowledges that
any unauthorized use of the Proprietary Information or Customer Information
by Employee, or any disclosure of the same to any third parties, would be
wrongful and would cause irreparable injury to the Company, its customers,
suppliers, employees, clients and/or Affiliates.

(b) Accordingly, Employee covenants and agrees that during the period
beginning on the Effective Date and ending three (3) years following
Employees termination of employment, Employee will (i) hold the Proprietary
Information and Customer Information in strictest confidence; (ii) not
disclose such information to any person, firm, corporation or other entity,
other than as required by applicable law; and (iii) not use such information
for any purpose not expressly authorized in writing by the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employees obligations with respect to
Proprietary Information that constitutes trade secrets shall continue for so
long as permitted by applicable law. Employee also agrees that upon request of
the Company Employee will return all business records in
Employees possession or control in any way relating to the Company or its
business, its Proprietary Information or Customer Information. Employee agrees
to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any loss, claim or damages,
including attorneys fees and costs, arising out of or relating to Employees
unauthorized disclosure and use of the Companys Proprietary Information or
Customer Information.

 

(c) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Customer Information_ "
shall mean, whether verbal, written or stored electronically, (i)
confidential product or technology information of any customer of the Company,
as indicated by such customer; (ii) confidential information regarding the
business of any customer or its clients learned in the course of providing
service and/or products to the customer on behalf of the Company; (iii) other
confidential information submitted from time to time by a customer to the
Company; and (iv) the identity of the customer as the source of such data
or information provided to Employee by the Company. Customer Information
shall in all events, however, exclude information that is (A) generally
available to or known by the public, (B) not actually provided to Employee
during Employees period of employment, and/or (C) provided directly to
Employee by any customer of the Company after Employees termination of
employment provided that before such disclosure was made such customer knew
that Employee was no longer employed by the Company.

 



6 (d) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Proprietary Information_ "
shall mean, whether verbal, written or stored electronically, all customer
lists, prospective customer lists, trade secrets, databases, processes,
computer programs, software, object codes, source codes, passwords, entry
codes, inventions, improvements, business data, prospective employee lists,
business contact information of the Company or developed for the Company or
any of the Companys Affiliates or customers, information relating to the
Companys or any of its Affiliates business contracts, marketing strategies,
any other secret or confidential matter relating or pertaining to the
products, services, sales or other business of the Company, or any Affiliate,
and shall include Customer Information that was developed or enhanced by the
Company or any Affiliate including data furnished by or on behalf of the
customer. Proprietary Information shall in all events, however, exclude
information that is (i) generally available to or known by the public; (ii)
not actually provided to Employee during Employees period of employment,
(iii) is or becomes available to the Employee on a non-confidential basis from
a source other than the Company, or (iv) has been independently acquired or
developed by the Employee without violating any of its obligations under this
Agreement.

9\. _Return of Documents_. Upon termination of Employees employment with the
Company for any reason, all documents, procedural manuals, guides,
specifications, plans, drawings, diskettes, designs, software and similar
materials, diaries, records, customer lists, notebooks, and similar
repositories of or containing Proprietary Information, or Customer
Information, including all copies thereof, then in Employees possession or
control, whether prepared by Employee or others, shall be left with, or
forthwith returned by Employee to, the Company.

10\. _Non-Competition_. In connection with the terms of employment contained
herein, which Employee considers to be good and valuable consideration, the
Company and Employee agree that, during Employees employment, Employee shall
not engage in Prohibited Activity anywhere in the world. For purposes of this
_Section 10_, " _Prohibited Activity_ " is activity in which Employee:

(a) acts as an employee, employer, owner, operator, manager, advisor,
consultant, agent, partner, director, stockholder or officer or any other
similar capacity to an entity established or engaged in the business of

Competitive Business.

 



7 11\. _Non-Solicitation of Employees and Others_. During Employees employment
and for a period of one (1) year following the termination of Employees
employment for any reason, Employee will not directly or indirectly interfere
with the Companys business by hiring, raiding or soliciting any of the
Companys employees to terminate their employment, or disrupt the
relationship between the Company and any of its consultants, agents,
representatives or vendors; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction
shall not prohibit any such activities conducted in connection with
generalized solicitations not specifically directed at the Company or its
respective employees. Employee acknowledges that this covenant is necessary to
enable the Company to maintain a stable workforce and remain in business.

12\. _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Employee agrees that upon conception and/or development of any idea,
discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other material or
design that: (i) relates to the business of the Company, or (ii) relates to
the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or
(iii) results from any work performed by Employee for the Company, Employee
will assign to the Company the entire right, title and interest in and to any
such idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material or design.

 

(b) Employee has no obligation to assign any idea, discovery, invention,
improvement, software, writing or other material or design that Employee
conceives and/or develops entirely on Employees own time without using the
Companys equipment, supplies, facilities or trade secret information unless
the idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or
other material or design: (i) relates to the business of the Company, (ii)
relates to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or
development, or (iii) results from any work performed by Employee for the
Company.

 

(c) Employee agrees that any idea, discovery, invention, improvement,
software, writing or other material or design that relates to the business of
the Company or relates to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated
research or development which is conceived or suggested by Employee, either
solely or jointly with others, within one (1) year following termination
of Employees employment shall be presumed to have been so made, conceived or
suggested in the course of such employment with the use of the Companys
equipment, supplies, facilities, and/or trade secrets.

 

(d) In order to determine Employees rights and the rights of the Company in
any idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material, and to insure the protection of the same, Employee agrees that
during Employees employment, and for one (1) year after the termination of
Employees employment, Employee will disclose immediately and fully to the
Company any idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or
other material or design conceived, made or developed by Employee solely or
jointly with others. The Company agrees to keep any such disclosures
confidential. Employee also agrees to record descriptions of all work in the
manner directed by the Company, and Employee agrees that all such records and
copies, samples and experimental materials will be the exclusive property of
the Company.

 



8 (e) Employee agrees that at the request of and without charge to the Company,
but at the Companys expense, Employee will execute a written assignment of
the idea, discovery, invention, improvement, software, writing or other
material or design to the Company and will assign to the Company any
application for letters patent or for trademark registration made thereon,
and to any common-law or statutory copyright therein; and Employee will do
whatever may be necessary or desirable to enable the Company to secure any
patent, trademark, copyright, or other property right therein in the United
States of America and in any foreign country, and any division, renewal,
continuation, or continuation in part thereof, or for any reissue of any
patent issues thereon.

 

(f) In the event the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, and in any
event after ten business days, to secure Employees signature on a written
assignment to the Company of any application for letters patent or to any
common-law statutory copyright or other property right therein, whether
because of Employees physical or mental incapacity or for any other
reason whatsoever, Employee irrevocably designates and appoints the President
of the Company as Employees attorney-in-fact to act on Employees behalf to
execute and file any such application and to do all other lawfully permitted
acts to further the prosecution and issuance of such letters patent,
copyright or trademark.

13\. _Company s Remedies_.

 

(a) Employee acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and undertakings
contained in _Sections 7_ , _8_ , _9_ , _10_ ,  _11_ and _12_ of this
Agreement relate to matters which are of a special, unique, extraordinary,
managerial and intellectual character which gives them a peculiar value and
that a violation of any of the terms of such Sections will cause irreparable
injury to the Company, the amount of which will be difficult, if not
impossible, to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately
compensated. Therefore, Employee agrees that the Company, in addition to any
other available remedies under applicable law, shall be entitled, as a matter
of course, to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable relief from
any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any violation or threatened
violation of any such terms by Employee and such other persons as the court
shall order.

(b) Employee agrees that the restrictions contained in _Sections 7_ ,  _8_ ,
_9_ , _10_ , _11_ and _12_ are reasonable in all respects and are to be
interpreted in light of all the facts and circumstances existing at the time
enforcement is sought. However, should any court or other body of competent
jurisdiction determine that all or any portion of the agreements set forth
herein is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such agreement (or portion
thereof) shall be restricted and deemed amended to the minimum extent
necessary so as to preserve and establish its validity and enforceability.

14\. _Employee s Remedies_. Employees sole remedy against the Company for
breach of this Agreement is the collection of any compensation and benefits
due to Employee as provided in _Section 6_.

legal representative, shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise
to assign or otherwise dispose of any right of Employee under this Agreement.

any successor to the Companys business or any portion thereof. This Agreement

to be funded, it is understood that the Companys obligations under this
Agreement are not funded, and it is agreed that the Company shall not be
required to set aside or escrow any monies in advance of the due date of
the payment of such monies to Employee.

17\. _Withholding_. The Company shall be entitled to withhold from any salary,
bonus, benefits, or other compensation payable to Employee hereunder such
amounts as it is required or authorized to withhold under applicable laws.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not
be obligated to guarantee any particular tax result for Employee with respect

payment.

Agreement must be in writing and shall be deemed conclusively to have been

    4.3 | Recovering a Loss 
---|--- 

Any Loss payable by the Insurer shall only be in the form of a monetary
payment and the Insurer shall not be obliged to seek, pursue or satisfy on

or other non-monetary relief.

 



   5 | RETENTION 
---|--- 



   5.1 | Liability in excess of the Retention 
---|--- 

The Insurer shall only be liable for Loss once the Retention has been fully
eroded. The Retention (as adjusted in accordance with Section 5.3 below) shall
apply until such time as it has been fully eroded after which no Retention
shall apply.

 



   5.2 | Erosion of the Retention 
---|--- 

The Retention shall be eroded by Loss for which the Insurer would be liable
under this Policy but for the Retention. The Retention shall also be eroded by
Uncovered Losses but in no event shall the Retention be eroded to less than:

 

(a) the amount set forth in Item 5(b) of the Declarations prior to the First
Retention Dropdown Date; and

 

(b) the amount set forth in Item 5(c) of the Declarations between the First
Retention Dropdown Date and the Second Retention Dropdown Date.

referenced in Sections 6.1(xii) and 6.1(xiii) of this Policy.



   5.3 | Retention Dropdown 
---|--- 

From the First Retention Dropdown Date until the Second Retention Dropdown
Date, the Retention shall be reduced to the lesser of: (i) $3,500,000; or (ii)
$7,000,000 less the sum of (A) the total amount of Losses plus (B) Uncovered
Losses (subject to Section 5.2 above), in each case, then incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred resulting from claims incurred or made on
or before the First Retention Dropdown Date; provided that Losses and/or
Uncovered Losses estimated as reasonably expected to be incurred (and the
corresponding erosion of the Retention) shall be adjusted when actually
incurred.

After the Second Retention Dropdown Date, the Retention shall be reduced to
the lesser of: (i) $1,750,000; or (ii) $3,500,000 less the sum of (A) the
total amount of Loss plus (B) Uncovered Losses (subject to Section 5.2 above),
in each case, then incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred resulting
from claims incurred or made on or before the Second Retention Dropdown Date;
provided that Losses and/or Uncovered Losses estimated as reasonably expected
to be incurred (and the corresponding erosion of the Retention) shall
be adjusted when actually incurred).

In no event will the aggregate amount of the initial and subsequent Retentions
cause the Insured to sustain Loss in an amount that exceeds US$7,000,000. ---|---|---

Agreement_ "). The Company considers it important to the operation of
the business of the Company that you are motivated to remain employed with
the Company through the closing date of the Purchase Agreement (the " _Closing
Date_ "). Further, the Company has entered into that certain Employment
Agreement with you, dated as of September 19, 2014 (the " _Employment
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which you will continue your employment with the
Company following the Closing Date in accordance with the terms thereof.
Capitalized terms used but undefined herein have the meanings ascribed to
them in the Employment Agreement.

1\. _Retention Bonus_. For and in consideration of your continued service
with the Company, we offer you a retention bonus (the " _Retention Bonus_ ")
in the amount of $[ ], less all applicable withholdings and deductions
required by law (the " _Retention Bonus Amount_ ").

2\. _Payment_. If you are eligible to receive the Retention Bonus in
accordance with  _Section 3_ below, it will be paid to you pursuant to the
following terms:

scheduled pay date following the Closing Date in accordance with the Companys
standard payroll practices as in effect at such time.

b. Fifty percent (50%) of the Retention Bonus Amount (the " _Second
Bonus Payout_ ") shall be paid to you on the first regularly scheduled pay
date following the earlier of (i) the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Closing Date or (ii) the date on which your employment is terminated
without "Cause" or terminated for "Good Reason" (as such terms are defined in
the Employment Agreement), in each case in accordance with the Companys
standard payroll practices as in effect at such time. 3\. _Eligibility_.

 

a. _First Bonus Payout_. You will be eligible to receive the First Bonus
Payout if all of the following eligibility criteria are satisfied:

i. You entered into the Employment Agreement with the Company.

 

ii. Your performance has been satisfactory, as determined in the Companys
sole discretion, from the date of this letter agreement through the Closing
Date (the " _First Bonus Eligibility Date_ ").

iii. You remained continuously employed by the Company (or any successor
entity) from the date of this letter agreement through the First Bonus
Eligibility Date.

 

b. _Second Bonus Payout_. You will be eligible to receive the Second Bonus

ii. You remained continuously employed by the Company (or any successor
entity) from the First Bonus Eligibility Date through the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Second Bonus Eligibility Date_ ");
provided that you will be eligible to receive the Second Bonus Payout if your
employment is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason on or before the
Second Bonus Eligibility Date.

4\. _No Guarantee of Employment_. The Company reserves the right to
terminate you at any time and for any or no reason, subject to the provisions
of the Employment Agreement or such other employment agreement entered into
between you and the Company that may be in effect at the time of any such
termination.

 

5\. _Section 409A Compliance_. This letter agreement is intended to comply
with, or be exempt from, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,

accordance with Section 409A.

 

6\. _Termination_. This letter agreement shall automatically terminate and be
of no further force and effect upon the earliest of: (i) the payment of the
Second Bonus Payout, (ii) the termination of the Purchase Agreement in
accordance with its terms, or (iii) the written agreement of the parties
hereto; _provided_ that the termination of this letter agreement shall not
affect your obligation under _Section 7_, which shall continue and survive

shall remain in full force and effect.

 

9\. _Amendments_. This letter agreement may not be amended or modified unless
in writing signed by both parties hereto.

 

10\. _Forum Selection; Governing Law_. Each party hereto consents to personal
jurisdiction in any action brought in any federal or state court within the

NOTICE OF TERRORISM

 

INSURANCE COVERAGE

You are notified that under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, as amended,
that you have a right to purchase insurance coverage for losses resulting from
acts of terrorism, as defined in Section 102(1) of the Act: The term "act of
terrorism" means any act that is certified by the Secretary of the
Treasuryin concurrence with the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General
of the United Statesto be an act of terrorism; to be a violent act or an act
that is dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure; to have
resulted in damage within the United States, or outside the United States in
the case of certain air carriers or vessels or the premises of a United States
mission; and to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part
of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to
influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by
coercion.

 

YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT WHERE COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BY THIS POLICY FOR LOSSES
RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM, SUCH LOSSES MAY BE
PARTIALLY REIMBURSED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT UNDER A FORMULA
ESTABLISHED BY FEDERAL LAW. HOWEVER, YOUR POLICY MAY CONTAIN OTHER EXCLUSIONS
WHICH MIGHT AFFECT YOUR COVERAGE, SUCH AS AN EXCLUSION FOR NUCLEAR EVENTS.
UNDER THE FORMULA, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT GENERALLY REIMBURSES 85% OF
COVERED TERRORISM LOSSES EXCEEDING THE STATUTORILY ESTABLISHED DEDUCTIBLE PAID
BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY PROVIDING THE COVERAGE. THE PREMIUM CHARGED FOR THIS
COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BELOW AND DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY CHARGES FOR THE PORTION
OF LOSS THAT MAY BE COVERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE ACT.

YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THE TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT, AS AMENDED,
CONTAINS A $100 BILLION CAP THAT LIMITS U.S. GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT AS WELL
AS INSURERS LIABILITY FOR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CERTIFIED ACTS OF TERRORISM
WHEN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH LOSSES IN ANY ONE CALENDAR YEAR EXCEEDS $100 BILLION.
IF THE AGGREGATE INSURED LOSSES FOR ALL INSURERS EXCEED $100 BILLION, YOUR
COVERAGE MAY BE REDUCED.

Acceptance or Rejection of Terrorism Insurance Coverage

I hereby elect to purchase terrorism coverage for a prospective premium of $ 

I hereby decline to purchase terrorism coverage for certified acts of
terrorism. I understand that I will have no coverage for losses resulting
