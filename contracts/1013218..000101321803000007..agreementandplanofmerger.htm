  1.4   _Additional Action_. The Surviving Corporation may, at any time after the Effective Time, take any action, including executing and delivering any document, in the name and on behalf of either the Debtor or the Merger Subsidiary, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

  1.5   _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and the Amended Plan and without any further action on the part of any person or entity: 
  
  

  (a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall evidence one share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  (b) Each share of capital stock of the Debtor (collectively, the "Debtor Stock") that is either outstanding or held in the treasury of the Debtor immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each option, warrant or other right issued by the Debtor to acquire any of its capital stock and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. Pursuant to Section 303 of the DGCL and the Amended Plan, holders of the Debtor Stock shall have no statutory right of appraisal in connection with the Merger, and such holders shall have no right to approve or disapprove the Merger or this Agreement.

   

  1.6 _Certificate of Incorporation_. From and after the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Merger Subsidiary, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and as amended by the Certificate of Merger, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (except that the name of the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Debtor), until thereafter further amended as provided by law and such certificate of incorporation.

  

  1.7 _By-laws_. From and after the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Merger Subsidiary, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (except that the name of the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Debtor), until thereafter further amended as provided by law, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such by-laws.

   

  1.8 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Merger Subsidiary and the officers of the Debtor immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be and continue as the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  1.9   _Payment of Administrative Claims and Expenses_. At the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use a portion of the Merger Consideration to (i) pay or assume the allowed administrative and priority claims and expenses of the Debtor,(including, (a) the payment of obligations under the existing debtor-in-possession financing agreement dated as of January 22, 2003 (the "DIP Credit Facility") and (b) the assumption of post-petition trade payables arising in the Ordinary Course of Business (as defined in Section 2.3)), and (ii) pay the creditors of the Debtor as specified in the Amended Plan.   

  1.10 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. (a) Not later than the business day next preceding the Effective Date, the Debtor and the Buyer will in good faith jointly estimate: (i) the Working Capital Assets (as defined below) as of the close of business on such business day (the "Estimated Working Capital Assets") provided that if the Debtor\'s and the Buyer\'s respective estimates thereof do not agree, then the Estimated Working Capital Assets will be the arithmetic average of the Debtor\'s and the Buyer\'s respective estimates thereof; and (ii) the Working Capital Liabilities (as defined below) as of the close of business on such business day (the "Estimated Working Capital Liabilities"); provided that if the Debtor\'s and the Buyer\'s respective estimates thereof do not agree, then the Estimated Working Capital Liabilities will be the arithmetic average of the Debtor\'s and the Buyer\'s respective estimates thereof. The Estimated Working Capital Assets minus the Estimated Working Capital Liabilities shall be the "Estimated Working Capital". If the Estimated Working Capital is less than $3,100,000, then subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Buyer of the Buyer\'s condition to close set forth in Section 5.2(h), the Merger Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to such difference. If the Estimated Working Capital is more than $3,100,000, the Merger Consideration shall be unchanged. "Working Capital Assets" means all assets comprising the line items listed under "working capital assets" in Section 1.10(a) of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule, valued on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP consistent with the Debtor\'s past practices and the methodology used to determine Working Capital Assets as of March 31, 2003, as set forth in Section 1.10(a) of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule. "Working Capital Liabilities" means all liabilities comprising the line items listed under "working capital liabilities" in Section 1.10(a) of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule, valued on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP consistent with the Debtor\'s past practices and the methodology used to determine Working Capital Liabilities as of March 31, 2003, as set forth in Section 1.10(a) of the Debtor Disclosure.

  

 (b) _Final Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Within 60 days after the
Effective Date, the Surviving Corporation will determine the actual Working
Capital Assets and the actual Working Capital Liabilities as of the close of
business on the business day preceding the Effective Date. Such actual Working
Capital Assets minus such actual Working Capital Liabilities shall be the
"Closing Working Capital". The Distributable Amount (as defined in the Amended
Plan) shall equal $17,300,000 (i) plus the amount, if any, by which the
Closing Working Capital exceeds $3,600,000 or minus the amount, if any, by
which $3,100,000 exceeds the Closing Working Capital and (ii) minus the
amount, if any, by which the amount applied or to be applied pursuant to the
Amended Plan to satisfy the holders of Allowed Claims in Classes 1S, 2, 3 and
4 under the Amended Plan, the Allowed DIP Credit Facility Claims, Allowed
Administrative Claims and Allowed Tax Claims (as those terms are defined in
the Amended Plan), exceeds $22,700,000.

  

ARTICLE II

  The Debtor represents and warrants to the Buyer that the statements contained in this Article II are true and complete, except as set forth in the disclosure schedule of the Debtor delivered to the Buyer simultaneously with the execution and delivery hereof (the "Debtor Disclosure Schedule"). The Debtor Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs contained in this Article II, and the disclosures in any section or paragraph of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule shall qualify other sections or paragraphs in this Article II only to the extent that it is reasonably clear from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections or paragraphs. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Debtor Material Adverse Effect" shall mean a material adverse effect (or any condition, change, event or state of facts, arising or existing before or after the date of this Agreement, that could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect), in any one or more fiscal periods of the Debtor, on the business, results of operations, assets (including licenses, franchises and other intangible assets), financial condition, operating income or prospects of the Debtor (or the Surviving Corporation) and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 2.1(a)), taken as a whole, excluding any effect (i) generally applicable to the economy or the industry in which the Debtor conducts its business; or (ii) arising from the commencement of the Chapter 11 Proceeding or any action ordered by the Bankruptcy Court and approved by the Buyer.    

  2.1 _Organization, Qualification, Corporate Power and Authority_.

   

  (a) Each of the Debtor and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly organized (or duly formed, as applicable), validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization (or formation). Each of the Debtor and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to conduct business and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction (each such jurisdiction being set forth in Section 2.1(a) of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule) in which the nature of its businesses or the ownership or leasing of its properties requires such qualification. Section 2.1(a) of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule (i) lists all Subsidiaries of the Debtor and the Debtor\'s ownership interest therein and the jurisdiction in which the Debtor or such Subsidiary was organized and (ii) sets forth a true and correct organizational chart for the Debtor and each of its corporate Subsidiaries. For the purpose of this Agreement, the term "Subsidiary" means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other legal entity of which the Buyer or the Debtor, as the case may be (either alone or through or together with any other Subsidiary), owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities or equity interests of such legal entity or is the general partner of such legal entity, but excludes any such entities that are dormant and have no operations or assets (the "Dormant Entities"). The Debtor has made available to the Buyer true and complete copies of the respective charters and by-laws (or comparable organizational documents), each as amended and in effect on the date hereof, of the Debtor and its Subsidiaries. Subject to supervision by the Bankruptcy Court in accordance with Title 11 of the United States Code, in the case of the Debtor (the "Bankruptcy Code"), each of the Debtor and each of its Subsidiaries has all necessary corporate, limited liability company or limited partnership power and authority to own its respective properties and assets and to carry on its respective businesses as now conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership, as the case may be, in good standing in all jurisdictions in which the character or the location of its owned or leased assets or the nature of the business it conducts requires licensing or qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Debtor Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Debtor and each of its Subsidiaries has at all times complied with, and is not in default under or in violation of, any provision of its charter or by-laws, other than where the failure to so comply and such defaults and violations could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Debtor Material Adverse Effect.      

  (b) Subject to the entry of the Sale Order (as defined in Section 4.4(a)), the Debtor has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement. Subject to the entry of the Sale Order, this Agreement has been (i) duly and validly executed and delivered by the Debtor and (ii) duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Debtor. Subject to the entry of the Sale Order, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Debtor enforceable against the Debtor in accordance with its terms.

  

  (c)  The Debtor has the requisite power and authority to execute and file with the Bankruptcy Court the Amended Plan. The Amended Plan has been (i) duly and validly executed by the Debtor and (ii) duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Debtor. Upon the entry of the Confirmation Order, the Amended Plan will constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Debtor enforceable against the Debtor in accordance with its terms.

  

   2.2 _Capitalization_. Immediately prior to the Effective Date
(and immediately prior to the Merger), the authorized capital stock of the
Debtor will be as set forth in Section 2.2 of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule.
On the Effective Date, after giving effect to the Amended Plan, there will be
no outstanding Debtor Stock (other than shares of common stock of the Merger
Subsidiary converted into shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to Section 1.5(a) hereof) and no outstanding or authorized options,
warrants, rights, calls, convertible instruments, agreements or commitments to
which the Debtor is a party or which are binding upon the Debtor providing for
the issuance, disposition or acquisition of any of its capital stock or stock
appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights.

  

   2.3 _Noncontravention_. Except for the applicable requirements
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), any
applicable state and foreign securities laws, and if applicable, the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"),
and the Bankruptcy Code, the Confirmation Order and the Amended Plan, none of
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Debtor, and the execution
and filingwith the Bankruptcy Court of the Amended Plan by the Debtor or the
consummation of thetransactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (a)
conflict with or violate any provision of the respective charters or by-laws
of the Debtor and its Subsidiaries; (b) except as disclosed in Section 2.14(d)
of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule, require on the part of the Debtor or any of
its Subsidiaries any filing with, or any permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any court, arbitrational tribunal, administrative agency or
commission or other governmental or regulatory authority or agency (a
"Governmental Entity"), other than where the failure to make or obtain such
filings, permits, authorizations, consents or approvals could not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Debtor Material
Adverse Effect or materially adversely affect the ability of the Surviving
Corporation to operate the business of the Debtor or any of its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time; (c) except for the Required Waivers and Consents
(as defined in Section 5.2(d)) and except as set forth in Section 2.13(b) of
the Debtor Disclosure Schedule, conflict with, result in a breach of,

sublicense, franchise, permit, indenture, agreement or mortgage for borrowed
money, instrument of indebtedness, Security Interest (as defined below in this
Section 2.3) or other arrangement to which Debtor or any of its Subsidiaries

any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other
than such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,

or waivers that could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Debtor Material Adverse Effect; or (d) result in the
imposition of any Security Interest upon any assets of the Debtor or any of
its Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Security Interest"
means any mortgage, pledge, security interest, encumbrance, charge or other
lien (whether arising by contract or by operation of law), other than liens
arising in the ordinary course of business consistent with the Debtor and its
Subsidiaries\'past custom and practice, including with respect to frequency
and amount (the "Ordinary Course of Business").      2.4   _Business Entities_.

  

   (a) Section 2.4(a) of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of each corporation, partnership, limited liability
company or other form of business association (a "Business Entity"), other
than Dormant Entities, in which the Debtor, directly or indirectly, owns any
equity interest or any security convertible into or exchangeable for an equity
interest (each a "Debtor Business Entity").

  

 (b) The Debtor Business Entities listed in Section 2.4(b) of the Debtor
Disclosure Schedule are the only Debtor Business Entities which have conducted
any operations, trade or businesses of the Debtor since January 22, 2003 (the
"Filing Date"), hold any Debtor Authorizations (as defined in Section 2.14(a))
or own any assets necessary for the conduct of the business of the Debtor or
any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

  

 (c) No Debtor Business Entity is in default under or in violation of
any provision of its organizational documents. All the issued and outstanding
equity interests of each Debtor Business Entity are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. From and
after the Effective Time, after giving effect to the effectiveness of the
Amended Plan and the Merger, the equity interests of each Debtor Business
Entity that are held of record or owned beneficially by the Debtor immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be held or owned by the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any restrictions on transfer (other than restrictions under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and state or
foreign securities laws), claims, Security Interests, options, warrants,
rights, contracts, calls, commitments, equities and demands.

  

 (d) There are no voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or
understandings with respect to the voting of any equity interests of any
Debtor Business Entity to which the Debtor is a party or by which it is bound,
or, any other such trusts, proxies, agreements or understandings.

   

  2.5 _Financial Statements; Accounts Receivable; Inventory_.     (a) The Debtor has previously provided or made available to the
Buyer (i) the audited consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations
and changes in stockholders\'equity and cash flows of the Debtor and its
Subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2000, December 31,
2001 and December 31, 2002 (the "Audited Debtor Financial Statements") and
(ii) the unaudited consolidated statements of operations and changes in
stockholders\'equity and cash flows of the Debtor and its Subsidiaries as of
and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2003 (the "Unaudited Debtor
Financial Statements"; March 31, 2003 being the "Debtor Balance Sheet Date").
Such financial statements (collectively, the "Debtor Financial Statements"),
(i) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") with respect thereto; (ii) have been
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
covered thereby (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto
and, in the case of interim financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q
under the Exchange Act); (iii) fairly present the consolidated financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Debtor as of the
respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein; and (iv) are
consistent with the books and records of the Debtor, subject, in the case of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), (a) to the paragraph in the report of independent
auditors on the Audited Debtor Financial Statements describing conditions that
raise substantial doubt about the Debtor\'s ability to continue as a going
concern, and (b) to the Debtor Financial Statements not including any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and
classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
may result from the outcome of these uncertainties. The schedules of assets
and liabilities filed with the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Proceeding,
as amended, include a list which is true and complete in all material respects
of all the material creditors, indicating whether secured or unsecured, of the
Debtor at the Filing Date.

  

 (b) The Debtor has previously provided to the Buyer its unaudited pro
forma consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2003, which shows the
Unaudited Debtor Balance Sheet (as defined in Section 2.7) adjusted to give
effect to the Amended Plan and the Merger as though the Effective Date
occurred on March 31, 2003, which pro forma consolidated balance sheet has
been prepared using "fresh start accounting" and is in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis otherwise consistent with the Unaudited Debtor Balance
Sheet (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto) (the "Pro
Forma Debtor Balance Sheet"). The assumptions used in preparing the Pro Forma
Debtor Balance Sheet provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant
effects attributable to the transactions or events described therein and the
related pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to such assumptions.

  

 (c) The Debtor has previously provided to the Buyer the Schedule L
balance sheet submitted with the 2001 tax return (the "2001 Schedule L Balance
Sheet"). Section 2.5(c) of the Disclosure Schedule describes in general the
categories of transactions and adjustments occurring in 2002 other than in the
Ordinary Course of Business, which may result in material differences between
the 2001 Schedule L Balance Sheet and the Schedule L Balance Sheet to be
submitted with the Debtor\'s 2002 tax return.

  

(d) The accounts receivable of the Debtor reflected on the Unaudited
Debtor Balance Sheet (as defined in Section 2.7), and those arising since the
date of the Unaudited Debtor Balance Sheet, are valid receivables subject to
no material set-offs or counterclaims, net of a reserve for bad debts, which
reserve is reflected on the Unaudited Debtor Balance Sheet.     

   2.6   _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as set forth in
Section 2.6 of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule, since March 31, 2003, (a) there
has not been any Debtor Material Adverse Effect, nor has there occurred any
event or development that could reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Debtor Material Adverse Effect, (b) the Debtor and its
Subsidiaries have operated their respective businesses in the ordinary course
and in all respects in accordance with past practice, other than in connection
with and in furtherance of the Chapter 11 Proceeding, and (c) the Debtor has
not taken any action nor has it permitted any of its Subsidiaries to take any
action that would be prohibited by Section 4.5 below if taken from and after
the date of this Agreement.

  

   2.7 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Debtor nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability (whether known or unknown, whether absolute or
contingent, whether liquidated or unliquidated, whether due or to become due
and whether arising prior to or subsequent to the Filing Date), except for (a)
liabilities that will be fully discharged in the Chapter 11 Proceeding at the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Amended Plan or, with
respect to obligations arising under the DIP Credit Facility, otherwise paid
in full in cash; (b) liabilities that are reflected or disclosed on the
balance sheet included in the Unaudited Debtor Financial Statements (the
"Unaudited Debtor Balance Sheet"); (c) liabilities that have arisen since the
Debtor Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Debtor or
any of its Subsidiaries and that are similar in nature and amount to the
liabilities that are reflected on the Unaudited Debtor Balance Sheet and that
arose during the comparable period of time in the immediately preceding fiscal
period; (d) liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business of the
Debtor or any of its Subsidiaries that are not required by GAAP to be
reflected on the Unaudited Debtor Balance Sheet and that are not in the
aggregate material; (e) liabilities not exceeding $1 million in the aggregate
arising out of the nonpayment of property taxes; and (f) liabilities assumed
by the Debtor as expressly contemplated by the Amended Plan.

b (i) The Debtor and its Subsidiaries have delivered or otherwise made

made available to the Buyer true and complete copies of all licenses,
sublicenses or other agreements (each as amended to date) pursuant to which
the Debtor or any of its Subsidiaries uses such Debtor Intellectual Property,
all of which (other than licenses for commercially available software

 (a) The Debtor and its Subsidiaries hold all licenses, permits,
certificates, franchises, ordinances, registrations, or other rights,
applications and authorizations filed with, granted or issued by, or entered
by any Governmental Entity, asserting jurisdiction over the Debtor or any of
its Subsidiaries or their businesses or assets, that are required for the
conduct of their businesses as currently being conducted (each as amended to
date) (collectively, the "Debtor Authorizations"), other than such licenses,
permits, certificates, franchises, ordinances, registrations or other rights,
applications and authorizations the absence of which would not in the
aggregate materially impair the ability of the Debtor to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to own and operate the properties, assets and businesses of the
Debtor and its Subsidiaries following the Closing. Section 2.14(a) of the
Debtor Disclosure Schedule contains a true and complete list of such
Authorizations.

  

 (b) Section 2.14(b) of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule contains a true
and complete list of all licenses, certificates, consents, permits, approvals
and authorizations for the benefit of the Debtor or any of its Subsidiaries
pending before any state authority (collectively, the "Debtor State
Applications"). The Debtor Authorizations and the Debtor State Applications
(collectively, the "Debtor Licenses and Authorizations") are the only federal,
state or local licenses, certificates, consents, permits, approvals and
authorizations that are required for the conduct of the business and
operations of the Debtor and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted, other
than such consents, permits, approvals or authorizations the absence of which
could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
materially impair the ability of the Debtor to either consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to own and operate the properties, assets and businesses of the
Debtor and its Subsidiaries following the Closing.

  

(c)  Except as set forth in Section 2.14(c) of the Debtor Disclosure
Schedule, the Debtor Licenses and Authorizations are in full force and effect,
and other than Security Interests in favor of secured creditors and lessors,
have not been pledged or otherwise encumbered, assigned, suspended, modified
in any material adverse respect, canceled or revoked, and the Debtor and its
Subsidiaries have operated in compliance with all terms thereof or any
renewals thereof applicable to them, other than where the failure to so comply
could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Debtor Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of the Debtor
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to own and operate the properties, assets and
businesses of the Debtor and its Subsidiaries following the Closing. No event
has occurred with respect to any of the Debtor Licenses and Authorizations
which could reasonably be expected to permit, revocation or termination
thereof or to result in any other material impairment of the rights of the
holder of any such Debtor Authorizations. There is not pending any
application, petition, objection or other pleading with any state authority or
any similar body having jurisdiction or authority over the operations of the
Debtor and its Subsidiaries which questions the validity of or contests any
Debtor Authorization or which could reasonably be expected, if accepted or
granted, to result in the revocation, cancellation, suspension or any
materially adverse modification of any Debtor Authorization.   

 (d) Except for approval by the Bankruptcy Court or as set forth in
Section 2.14(d) of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule, no permit, consent,
approval, authorization, qualification or registration of, or declaration to

be obtained or made by the Debtor or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the transfer or deemed transfer of the Debtor Licenses and Authorizations
to the Buyer as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except where the failure to obtain or make such Approval could not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to materially impair
the ability of the Debtor to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to own and operate the
properties, assets and businesses of the Debtor or its Subsidiaries following
the Closing.

    

  2.15 _Litigation_.

Except for the regulatory matters addressed in Section 2.14, none of the actions, suits, proceedings or investigations listed in Section 2.15 of the Debtor Disclosure Schedule, if determined adversely to the interests of the Debtor or any of its Subsidiaries, could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Debtor Material Adverse Effect.>

true and complete list as of the most recent practicable date of all

practices or other collective bargaining disputes and, to the Debtor\'s
knowledge, no organizational effort is presently being made or threatened by

strike or other organized work force disturbance following the Closing.

Debtor Employee Benefit Plan that would subject the Debtor, any of its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of the Debtor or any of its Subsidiaries
to any material fine, penalty, Tax or liability of any kind imposed under
ERISA or the Code. No prohibited transaction (as defined in Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or breach of fiduciary duty (within the

Debtor Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA or the Code. No Debtor
Employee Benefit Plan, plan documentation or agreement, summary plan
description or other written communication distributed generally to employees
by its terms prohibits the Debtor or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any such Debtor Employee Benefit Plan and any Debtor Employee
Benefit Plan may be terminated without liability to the Debtor or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Buyer, except for benefits accrued through the date of
termination. Except as may be required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or

  (b) Except as set forth in Section 2.18(b) of the Debtor Disclosure
Schedule, there have been no releases of any Materials of Environmental
Concern (as defined below in this Section 2.18(b)) into the environment at any

jurisdiction in which such property or facility is located. With respect to
any such releases of Materials of Environmental Concern, the Debtor or any of
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, has given all required notices (if any) to
Governmental Entities (copies of which have been provided to the Buyer). There
have been no releases of Materials of Environmental Concern at parcels of real
property or facilities other than those owned, operated or controlled by the

or other third party) that were issued during the past five years relating to
premises formerly or currently owned, operated or controlled by the Debtor or
any of its Subsidiaries which are in the possession of the Debtor (or can be
obtained by the Debtor through reasonable efforts), have been delivered or
otherwise made available to the Buyer.

  

(d) The Debtor does not have any knowledge of any environmental liability
of the solid and hazardous waste transporters and treatment, storage and
disposal facilities that have been utilized by the Debtor or any of its
Subsidiaries.

required for the conduct of their businesses as currently conducted. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Environmental Authorization" means any
license, permit, certificate, identification number, or other authorization
from a Governmental Entity under any applicable Environmental Law. Each of the
Debtor and its Subsidiaries is and has been in material compliance with all
such Environmental Authorizations.   

  (f) None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Amended Plan will require the Debtor to comply with an Environmental Property
Transfer Act (as defined below in this Section 2.18(f)). For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Environmental Property Transfer Act" means any applicable
law (including rules, regulations and administrative orders thereunder) of any
federal, state, local or foreign government that requires any notification or
disclosure of environmental conditions in connection with the transfer, sale,
lease or closure of any property.

  

 (g) No radon, lead paint, or lead in drinking water is present at any
parcel of real property or any facility currently owned, operated or

Governmental Entity, that (a) affects or relates to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or (b) is applicable to the Debtor and its

contemplated hereby or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to own
and operate the properties, assets and businesses of the Debtor and its
Subsidiaries following the Closing.

benefits) under any Employee Benefit Plans correctly maintained by Buyer or
its Affiliates in which they become participants. The Buyer shall cause to be
waived any pre-existing condition limitation under its welfare plans that
might otherwise apply to an Affected Employee. The Buyer agrees to recognize

in all material respects at and as of the date of the Closing as if made on
and as of such date (unless such representation or warranty addresses matters
only as of a certain date, in which case such representation or warranty shall
be true and correct in all material respects as of such certain date) except
in circumstances in which the failure of such representation or warranty to be
true and correct (without giving effect to any limitations as to materiality
or "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) does not have, and could
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect and does not, and could not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of the Buyer
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 (b) the Buyer shall have performed or complied in all material respects
with its material agreements and covenants required to be performed or
complied with under this Agreement as of or prior to the Closing; and

  

 (c) the Buyer shall have delivered to the Debtor a certificate of an
officer of the Buyer (without qualification as to knowledge or materiality or
otherwise) to the effect that each of the conditions specified in clauses (a)
and (b) of this Section 5.3 is satisfied in all respects; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such certificate shall be given with the express
qualification that the affiant shall have no personal liability arising out of
his delivering such certificate to Debtor.    

ARTICLE VI 
 TERMINATION

  

   6.1 _Termination of Agreement_. The Parties may terminate this
Agreement prior to the Effective Date only as provided below:

  

  (a) the Parties may terminate this Agreement by mutual written
consent;

  

 (b) either the Buyer or the Debtor may terminate this Agreement by
giving written notice to the other in the event the other is in breach (i) (A)
in any material respect of any of its representations or warranties contained
in this Agreement that is not qualified as to materiality or (B) of any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement that is qualified as
to materiality, or (ii) in any material respect of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, and in either case such breach is not
remedied within five business days of delivery of such written notice thereof
(which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such breach)
and, in the case of any breach of the Debtor\'s representations and
warranties, such breach has had, or could reasonably be expected to have (x)
either a Debtor Material Adverse Effect or (y) the effect of materially
impairing the ability of the Debtor to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
own and operate the properties, assets and business of the Debtor and its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Date;

 

 (c) after December 31, 2003, the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by
giving written notice to the Debtor if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before such date (unless the failure results primarily from a breach by the
Buyer of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement);

  

(d) after December 31, 2003, the Debtor may terminate this Agreement by
giving written notice to the Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred on
or before such date (unless the failure results primarily from a breach by the
Debtor of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement);

  

 (e) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
the Debtor if the Sale Order has not been approved by the Bankruptcy Court on
or prior to July 23, 2003;

  

 (f) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
the Debtor if the Debtor breaches any of its covenants set forth in Section
4.4 or 4.7; and

 

 (g) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement upon any appointment in the
Chapter 11 Proceeding of a trustee or examiner.

   

  6.2   _Effect of Termination_. If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1, all obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any other Party, except for any liability of any Party for willful or intentional breaches of this Agreement (in which event the other parties shall retain all rights to exercise all available remedies at law or in equity), and except for the Debtor\'s obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee and the Buyer Expense Amount, if applicable, pursuant to Section 4.8, which shall survive any such termination; provided that Article VII shall also survive any such termination. After entry of the Sale Order as to any covenant or agreement contained herein and referred to therein, and after entry of the Confirmation Order, as to all other covenants and agreements contained herein, any claims arising out of or in connection with the Debtor\'s breach of any covenant or agreement herein shall constitute first priority administrative expenses under 11 U.S.C. §§ 503(b)(1) and 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code of the Debtor\'s bankruptcy estate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS FOR TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS   

Section 3.01 Unclassified Claims.   

 (a) DIP Credit Facility Claims.   

 On the Effective Date, to the extent that there are any amounts outstanding under the DIP Credit Facility, the Debtor shall pay such amounts in Cash on the Effective Date. Once such payments have been made, the DIP Credit Facility shall be deemed terminated and the lenders under the DIP Credit Facility shall take all reasonable action necessary to confirm the removal of any claims and liens on the properties of the Debtor or Reorganized Alterra securing the DIP Credit Facility Claim.   

 (b) Administrative Claims.   

 (i) General   

 Subject to (x) the bar date provisions herein and (y) additional requirements for professionals and certain other entities set forth below, Reorganized Alterra shall pay to each holder of an Allowed Administrative Claim, on account of its Administrative Claim and in full satisfaction thereof, Cash equal to the Allowed amount of such Administrative Claim on the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, unless the holder agrees or shall have agreed to other treatment of such Claim (in which event such agreement shall govern). Payment on an Administrative Claim that arose in the ordinary course of the Debtors business will not be made until such payment would have become due in the ordinary course of the Debtors business or under the terms of the Claim in the absence of the Chapter 11 Case.   

 (ii) Payment of Statutory Fees.   

 On or before the Effective Date, all fees payable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1930, as determined by the Court at the hearing on Confirmation, shall be paid in Cash in an amount equal to the Allowed amount of such Administrative Claim.   

 (iii) Bar Date For Administrative Claims.   

 1) General Provisions.   

 Except for (i) non-tax liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business by the Debtor, (ii) claims of professionals, and (iii) Postpetition Tax Claims (all of which are provided for below), requests for payment of Administrative Claims incurred on or prior to the Confirmation Date must be Filed and served on counsel for Reorganized Alterra no later than (x) thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, or (y) such later date, if any, as the Court shall order upon application made prior to the end of such 30-day period. Holders of Administrative Claims (including, without limitation, professionals and the holders of Postpetition Tax Claims) that are required to File a request for payment of such Claims and that do not File such requests by the applicable bar date shall be forever barred from asserting such Claims against the Debtor, Reorganized Alterra, or any of their respective properties.        

 2) Professionals.   

 All professionals or other Persons requesting compensation or reimbursement of expenses pursuant to any of sections 327, 328, 330, 331, 503(b) and 1103 of the Bankruptcy Code for services rendered on or before the Effective Date (including, inter alia, any compensation requested by any professional or any other Person for making a substantial contribution in the Chapter 11 Case) shall File and serve on the Reorganized Debtor an application for final allowance of compensation and reimbursement of expenses no later than (i) thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, or (ii) such later date as the Court shall order upon application made prior to the end of such 30-day period. Objections to applications of professionals for compensation or reimbursement of expenses must be Filed and served on Reorganized Debtor and the professionals to whose application the objections are addressed on or before (i) sixty days after such application is Filed and served or (ii) such later date as the Court shall order upon application made prior to the end of such 60-day period or upon agreement between the Reorganized Debtor and the affected professional. Any professional fees and reimbursements or expenses incurred by the Reorganized Debtor subsequent to the Effective Date may be paid by the Reorganized Debtor without application to or Order of the Court.   

 3) Ordinary Course Liabilities.   

 Holders of Administrative Claims based on liabilities incurred post-petition in the ordinary course of the Debtors business (other than Postpetition Tax Claims) shall not be required to File any request for payment of such Claims. Such Administrative Claims shall be paid by Reorganized Debtor pursuant to the terms and conditions of the particular transaction giving rise to such Administrative Claim, without any further action by the holders of such Claims.   

 4) Post-Petition Tax Claims.   

 All requests for payment of Postpetition Tax Claims, for which no bar date has otherwise been previously established, must be Filed on or before the later of (i) sixty (60) days following the Effective Date; and (ii) sixty (60) days following the filing of the tax return for such taxes for such tax year or period with the applicable governmental unit. Any holder of any Postpetition Tax Claim that is required to File a request for payment of such taxes and that does not File such a Claim by the applicable bar date shall be forever barred from asserting any such Postpetition Tax Claim against the Debtor, the Reorganized Debtor or any of their respective properties, whether any such Postpetition Tax Claim is deemed to arise prior to, on, or subsequent to, the Effective Date. The Debtor is paying all Postpetition Tax Claims as they come due; however, certain taxing authorities conduct audits which may result in a postpetition tax liability of which the Debtor is currently unaware.   

 (c) Priority Tax Claims.   

 Except as otherwise agreed to by Reorganized Debtor and the applicable taxing agency, Reorganized Debtor shall pay to each holder of an Allowed Priority Tax Claim deferred Cash payments, over a period not exceeding six years from the date of assessment of such Claim, in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of such Allowed Priority Tax Claim, plus interest

Section 3.02 Treatment of Classified Claims Against and Equity Interests in
Alterra.   

 _Alterra Class 1A, Et Seq.  Secured Claims_. Each identified Class 1A, _Et Seq.,_ Secured Claim is described in detail in the accompanying Disclosure Statement. Generally, on the Effective Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Holders of the Class 1A, _Et Seq_. Secured Claims (the "Class 1 Secured Claims") shall, in full satisfaction, settlement, release and discharge of and in exchange for such Secured Claims, receive (in the sole discretion of the Debtor as set forth in Article III above), the following treatment: either (a) the Plan shall leave unaltered the legal, equitable and contractual rights to which such Claims entitle the Holders; (b) (i) the Debtor shall cure any default with respect to such Claim that occurred before or after the Commencement Date, (ii) the maturity of such Claims shall be Reinstated as such maturity existed before any such default, (iii) the Holders of such Claims shall be compensated for any damages incurred as a result of any reasonable reliance by the Holders on any right to accelerate their Claims, and (iv) the legal, equitable, and contractual rights of such Holders will not otherwise be altered; (c) such Claims will receive treatment provided for in the applicable Settlement Agreement; (d) the applicable collateral will be returned to the Holder of the Secured Claim(s); or (e) such Claims shall receive such other treatment to which the Holders shall consent. The Holders of the Class 1 Secured Claims which are treated as set forth in clause (a) or (b) of this paragraph will be Unimpaired and deemed to have voted for the Plan; any Class 1 Secured Claims which are treated as set forth in clause (c), (d) or (e) of this paragraph shall be Impaired and entitled to vote on the Plan.   

 _Alterra Class 2A, Et Seq.  Miscellaneous Secured Claims_. Class 2 consists of all other Secured Claims against the Debtor. This Class will be further divided into subclasses designated by letters of the alphabet (Class 2A, Class 2B, and so on), so that each Holder of any Secured Claim is in a Class by itself, except to the extent that there are Secured Claims that are substantially similar to each other and may be included within a single Class. The Debtor will file a schedule of each Secured Claim on or before ten (10) days prior to the commencement of the Confirmation Hearing. Each Allowed Secured Claim in Class 2 will be treated as follows: either (a) the Plan shall leave unaltered the legal, equitable and contractual rights to which such Claim entitles the Holder; (b) (i) the Debtor shall cure any default with respect to such Claim that occurred before or after the Commencement Date, (ii) the maturity of such Claim shall be reinstated as such maturity existed before any such default, (iii) the Holder of such Claim shall be compensated for any damages incurred as a result of any reasonable reliance by the Holder on       

any right to accelerate its Claim, and (iv) the legal, equitable,
and contractual rights of such Holder will not otherwise be altered; (c)
the applicable collateral will be returned to the Holder of the Secured
Claim(s); or (d) such Claim shall receive such other treatment to which the
Holder shall consent. The Holder of each Allowed Secured Claim in Class 2
which is treated as set forth in clause (a) or (b) of this paragraph will be
Unimpaired and shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan; any
treatment under clause (c) or (d) of this paragraph will render the Claim
Impaired and the Holder thereof shall be entitled to vote on the Plan.  

 _Alterra Class 3  Resident Deposit Account Claims_. Class 3 is Unimpaired and therefore the Holders of Claims in Class 3 are conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan. Holders of Class 3 Claims are not entitled to vote on the Plan.   

 At the option of the Debtor or Reorganized Alterra, each Holder of an Allowed Class 3 Claim shall receive in full satisfaction, settlement, release and discharge of and in exchange for such Claim either payment in full in Cash or Reinstatement on the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter. Allowed Claims in Class 3 are not Impaired under the Plan and the Holders of Allowed Claims in Class 3 are conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan.   

 _Alterra Class 4  Priority Claims_. Class 4 is Unimpaired and therefore is presumed to accept the Plan. Holders of Class 4 Claims are not entitled to vote on the Plan.   

 A Priority Claim is a Claim for an amount entitled to priority under sections 507(a)(3), 507(a)(4), 507(a)(5) or 507(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code, and does not include any Administrative Claim or Priority Tax Claim. These unsecured Priority Claims include, among others: (a) unsecured Claims for accrued employee compensation earned within 90 days prior to the Commencement Date, to the extent of $4,650 per employee; (b) contributions to employee benefit plans arising from services rendered within 180 days prior to the Commencement Date, but only for such plans to the extent of (i) the number of employees covered by such plans multiplied by $4,650, less (ii) the aggregate amount paid to such employees under section 507(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, plus the aggregate amount paid by the Estate on behalf of such employees to any other employee benefit plan.   

 The Plan provides that unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, each Holder of an Allowed Claim in Class 4 will be paid the Allowed Amount of such Claim in full in Cash by Reorganized Debtor on or before the later of (i) the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, (ii) the date such Claim becomes an Allowed Claim and (iii) the date that such Claim would be paid in accordance with any terms and conditions of any agreements or understandings relating thereto between the Debtor or Reorganized Alterra and the Holder of such Claim. Allowed Claims in Class 4 are Unimpaired under the Plan and the Holders of Allowed Claims in Class 4 shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan.

ARTICLE IV. 
 TREATMENT OF EXECUTORY 
 CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES    

Section 4.01 General Treatment of Executory Contracts and Unexpired
Leases   

 The Plan constitutes a motion to assume or reject all executory contracts and nonresidential real property leases, except for those executory contracts and nonresidential real property leases (a) that have already been assumed or rejected pursuant to an earlier Order of the Court, or (b) that are the subject of a motion for such an Order pending as of the Confirmation Hearing.   

 Exhibit A to the Plan Supplement lists all executory contracts and nonresidential real property leases to be rejected, as identified in section 5.2(d) of the Merger Agreement. Any contract or lease not on Exhibit A to the Plan Supplement, and not otherwise the subject of a prior order or pending motion to reject, shall be deemed assumed by the Reorganized Debtor as of the Effective Date. Exhibit E to the Plan Supplement reflects all such executory contracts and non-residential real property leases to be assumed, together with the cure amount related thereto. Any party to an executory contract or non-residential real property lease that objects to the cure amount on Exhibit E to the Plan Supplement must File its objection, and serve it on the Debtor and the Buyer, no later than the date of the Confirmation Hearing.   

 The Reorganized Debtor, except as otherwise agreed by the non-debtor party to any executory contract or unexpired lease, will cure any and all undisputed defaults within 30 days after the Effective Date under any executory contract or unexpired lease assumed or assumed and assigned pursuant to the Plan, in accordance with section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. All disputed defaults that are required to be cured shall be cured either within 30 days after the entry of a Final Order determining the amount, if any, of the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors or Buyers liability with respect thereto, or as may be agreed otherwise by the parties.   

 All such assumed contracts and unexpired leases, franchises, permits, and any contracts or unexpired leases assumed by the Debtor by order of the Bankruptcy Court prior to the Confirmation Date, shall be vested in and continue in effect for the benefit of Reorganized Alterra.   

 Any Claim for damages arising from the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease must be Filed and served on counsel for the Debtor and Creditors Committee within thirty (30) days after the order of the Court (which order may be the Confirmation Order) approving such rejection becomes a Final Order or be (i) forever barred and unenforceable against the Debtor, its Estate, the Reorganized Debtor, and their respective property, and (ii) barred from receiving any Distribution under the Plan. All Allowed Claims arising from the rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases shall be treated as General Unsecured Claims.    

Section 4.02 Indemnification Obligations   

 Any obligation of the Debtor to indemnify its current and former directors, officers, employees, and any officer, director or employee serving as a fiduciary of any employee        

benefit plan or program, pursuant to charter, by-laws, or applicable
state law may be deemed to be, and may be treated as though they are,
executory contracts. For the purposes of the Plan, except as limited
hereinafter, executory contracts are to be treated in accordance with the
preceding section. To the extent that the Debtors indemnification
obligations are deemed executory contracts and are included among those to be
assumed, they shall survive the confirmation of this Plan and remain
unaffected thereby (subject to any defenses thereto), irrespective of whether
indemnification is owed in connection with a Pre-Petition Date or Post-
Petition Date occurrence.   

Section 4.03 Post-Petition Contracts and Leases   

 All contracts and leases entered into by the Debtor after the Petition Date, but excluding the DIP Credit Facility, shall be deemed assigned by the Debtor to Reorganized Alterra on the Effective Date.

Section 5.02 Merger Agreement   

 On the Effective Date but subject to the occurrence thereof, the Merger shall be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement and all related agreements.

be obligated to make any Distribution with respect to any unclassified Claim,
or any Allowed Claim, other than those in the hands of the Holders shown on
the books and records of the Debtor as of the Confirmation Hearing unless
otherwise identified on a Filed proof of claim.   

Section 5.06 The Creditors Committee

All Debtor Claims shall remain the property of Reorganized Alterra. Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a waiver of rights, if any, of the Debtor or Reorganized Alterra to a jury trial with respect to any Debtor Claim or objection to any Claim or Equity Interest. A schedule of the Debtor Claims, other than avoidance actions, is annexed to the Plan Supplement as Exhibit F.

 On the Effective Date, Reorganized Debtor shall adopt the Amended Alterra Certificate and the Amended Alterra Bylaws pursuant to applicable non-bankruptcy law and section 1123(a)(5)(I) of the Bankruptcy Code.

the extent that it relates to a Claim discharged.

 The Plan shall not become effective unless and until it has been confirmed and the following conditions have been satisfied in full or waived: (1) the Confirmation Order shall have become a Final Order; (2) all authorizations, consents and regulatory approvals (including, without limitation, any approvals required under regulations relating to the change in ownership of the Debtor upon the Effective Date) required (if any) for the Plans effectiveness shall have been obtained; (3) the Debtor and Buyer shall have satisfied all conditions and implemented and consummated the Merger; provided, that if the Merger is contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Date of the Plan, the Effective Date shall be deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger; and (4) all other actions and documents necessary to implement the treatment of creditor Claims shall have been effected or executed or, if waivable, waived by the Person or Persons entitled to the benefit thereof.    

Section 6.03 Waiver of Conditions   

 The Debtor may waive any or all of the other conditions to its obligation set forth in the Plan without leave of or order of the Court and without any formal action other than consent of the Buyer.

or to prejudice in any manner the rights of the Debtor or any person in any
further proceedings involving the Debtor.   

Section 6.05 Vacatur of Confirmation Order

A complete description of such provisions is located in the Disclosure Statement.    

ARTICLE VIII. 
 PROVISIONS REGARDING VOTING AND DISTRIBUTIONS 
 UNDER THE PLAN AND TREATMENT OF DISPUTED, 
 CONTINGENT AND UNLIQUIDATED CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS    

Section 8.01 Voting of Claims   

 Each holder of an Allowed Claim in an Impaired Class of Claims receiving a Distribution under the Plan shall be entitled to vote separately to accept or reject the Plan as provided in such order as may be entered by the Court establishing certain procedures with respect to the solicitation and tabulation of votes to accept or reject the Plan, or any other order or orders of the Court. An Impaired Class receiving no Distribution shall be deemed to have rejected the Plan.         

Section 8.02 Method of Distributions Under the Plan   

 (a) Distributions Under the Plan   

 On the Effective Date or as soon as practicable thereafter to the extent that the Plan provides for Distributions on account of Allowed Claims in the applicable Class on the Effective Date, or in the case of Classes 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, the Initial Distribution Date, each Holder of an Allowed Claim on such date will receive the full amount of the Distributions that the Plan provides for Allowed Claims in the applicable Class on such date. Thereafter, Distributions will be made semi-annually on  1 and  1 of each year, beginning  1, 200, to (a) Holders of Claims to whom a Distribution has become deliverable during the preceding calendar quarter and (b) to Holders of Disputed Claims in any such Class whose Claims were Allowed during the preceding calendar quarter. Such semi-annual Distributions will be in the full amount that the Plan provides for Allowed Claims in the applicable Class as of the date of such Distribution, without interest.   

 Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or the Confirmation Order, all Cash necessary for the Reorganized Debtor to make payments pursuant to the Plan will be obtained from the Debtors existing cash balances, the operations of the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, the Transaction Proceeds or from any post Effective Date borrowings, as applicable.   

 The Reorganized Debtor, or such Person(s) as the Reorganized Debtor may employ in its sole discretion, will serve as Disbursing Agent. The Disbursing Agent will make all Distributions of cash and securities required to be distributed under the applicable provisions of the Plan. The Disbursing Agent will serve without bond, and the Disbursing Agent, if a Person other than the Reorganized Debtor, will receive, without further Court approval, reasonable compensation for Distribution services rendered pursuant to the Plan and reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such services from the Reorganized Debtor on negotiated terms.   

 Cash payments made pursuant to the Plan will be in U.S. dollars by checks drawn on a bank selected by the Reorganized Debtor, or by wire transfer from a bank, at the option of Reorganized Debtor. Cash payments to foreign creditors, if any, may be made, at the option of the Reorganized Debtor, in such funds and by such means as are necessary or customary in a particular foreign jurisdiction.   

 (b) Timing and Compliance with Tax Requirements   

 (i) Compliance with Tax Requirements   

 In connection with the Plan, to the extent applicable, the Disbursing Agent must comply with all tax withholding and reporting requirements imposed on it by any governmental unit, and all Distributions pursuant to the Plan will be subject to such withholding and reporting requirements. The Disbursing Agent will be authorized to take any and all actions that may be necessary or appropriate to comply with such withholding and reporting requirements.   

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan: (i) each Holder of an Allowed Claim that is to receive a Distribution of Cash pursuant to the Plan will have sole and exclusive       

responsibility for the satisfaction and payment of any tax
obligations imposed by any governmental unit, including income, withholding
and other tax obligations, on account of such Distribution; and (ii) no
Distribution will be made to or on behalf of such Holder pursuant to the Plan
unless and until such Holder has made arrangements satisfactory to the
Disbursing Agent for the payment and satisfaction of such tax obligations.
Any Cash to be distributed pursuant to the Plan will, pending the
implementation of such arrangements, be treated as an undeliverable
Distribution pursuant to the Plan.  

 (ii) Distribution Record Date   

 As of the close of business on the Distribution Record Date, the transfer registers for any Old Securities maintained by the Debtor, or its respective agents, will be closed. The Disbursing Agent and the respective agents of the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor will have no obligation to recognize the transfer of the Old Securities occurring after the Distribution Record Date, and will be entitled for all purposes relating to the Plan to recognize and deal only with those Holders of record as of the close of business on the Distribution Record Date. Distributions under the Plan shall be made by Reorganized Debtor or a designee to the holders of Allowed Administrative Claims and Allowed Claims at the addresses set forth on the Schedules, unless such addresses are superseded by addresses listed on proofs of claim or transfers of claims filed pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 3001, or at the last known address of such holders if Reorganized Debtor has been notified in writing of a change of address.   

 (iii) Surrender of Cancelled Debt Instruments or Securities   

 As a condition precedent to receiving any Distribution pursuant to the Plan on account of an Allowed Claim evidenced by the Instruments canceled pursuant to the Plan, the Holder of such Claim shall tender the applicable Instruments evidencing such Claim to the Disbursing Agent pursuant to a letter of transmittal furnished by the Disbursing Agent. Any Cash to be distributed pursuant to the Plan on account of any such Claim will, pending such surrender, be treated as an undeliverable Distribution pursuant to the Plan.    

Section 8.03 Special Procedures for Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed
Instruments   

 In addition to any requirements under the Bylaws of the Debtor, any Holder of a Claim evidenced by an Instrument that has been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed will, in lieu of surrendering such Instrument, deliver to the Disbursing Agent: (a) evidence satisfactory to the Disbursing Agent of the loss, theft, mutilation or destruction; and (b) such security or indemnity as may be required by the Disbursing Agent to hold the Disbursing Agent harmless from any damages, liabilities or costs incurred in treating such individual as a Holder of an Instrument. Upon compliance with the Plan, the Holder of a Claim evidenced by such an Instrument will, for all purposes under the Plan, be deemed to have surrendered an Instrument, as applicable.    

Section 8.04 Failure to Surrender Cancelled Instrument   

 Any Holder of an Instrument that fails to surrender or be deemed to have surrendered such Instrument within one year after the Effective Date will have its Claim for a Distribution pursuant to the Plan on account of such Instrument discharged and shall be forever        

barred from asserting any such Claim against the Reorganized Debtor, Buyer or
their property. In such cases, any Cash held for Distribution on account
of such Claim will be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of the
Plan.   

Section 8.05 Undeliverable or Unclaimed Distributions   

 Any Person that is entitled to receive a cash Distribution under the Plan but that fails to cash a Distribution check within ninety (90) days after its issuance and delivery (or attempted delivery) shall be entitled to receive a reissued check from the Reorganized Debtor for the amount of the original check, without any interest, if such person requests to the Disbursing Agent that it reissue such check and provides the Disbursing Agent with such documentation as the Disbursing Agent requests to verify that such Person is entitled to such check, provided that such request occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date. If a Person fails to cash a check within ninety (90) days after its issuance and fails to request reissuance of such check prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date, such Person shall not be entitled to receive any Distribution under this Plan. In the event that interim Distributions are made under this Plan, any Person who fails to cash an interim Distribution check within ninety (90) days after its issuance and delivery (or attempted delivery) shall be entitled to receive a reissued check from the Reorganized Debtor for the amount of the original check, without any interest, if such Person requests to the Disbursing Agent that it reissue such interim Distribution check and provides the Disbursing Agent with such documentation as the Disbursing Agent requests to verify that such Person is entitled to such interim Distribution check, provided that such request occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date. A Person failing to cash an interim Distribution check within ninety (90) days after its issuance and failing to request from the Disbursing Agent reissuance of such check within the time period described above, shall forfeit all right to any subsequent Distributions, including final Distributions, under the Plan. Undeliverable Distributions will remain in the possession of the Disbursing Agent pursuant to the Plan until such time as a Distribution becomes deliverable, but in no event for a period longer than one year following the Effective Date. Undeliverable cash will be held in trust in segregated bank accounts in the name of the Disbursing Agent for the benefit of the potential claimants of such funds, and will be accounted for separately. The Disbursing Agent will hold undeliverable cash in a manner consistent with Reorganized Debtors investment and deposit guidelines. Any Distribution which is not claimed within one year after the Effective Date shall be deemed property of Reorganized Debtor without further notice to any party or further order of the Court.    

Section 8.06 Disputed Claims; Reserve and Estimations   

 (a) Treatment of Disputed Claims   

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no payments or Distributions will be made on account of a Disputed Claim, until such Claim becomes an Allowed Claim. Reorganized Debtor may, at any time, request that the Court estimate any contingent or unliquidated Claim pursuant to section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, irrespective of whether Reorganized Debtor previously objected to such Claim or whether the Court has ruled on any such objection. The Court will retain jurisdiction to estimate any contingent or unliquidated Claim at any time during litigation concerning any objection to the Claim, including during the pendency of any appeal relating to any such objection. If the Court estimates any contingent or       

unliquidated Claim, that estimated amount will constitute either the Allowed
Amount of such Claim or a maximum limitation on such Claim, as determined by
the Court. If the estimated amount constitutes a maximum limitation on such
Claim, Reorganized Debtor may elect to pursue any supplemental proceedings to
object to any ultimate payment on account of such Claim. All of these Claims
objection, estimation and resolution procedures are cumulative and not
necessarily exclusive of one another. In addition to seeking estimation of
Claims as provided in the Plan, Reorganized Debtor may resolve or adjudicate
certain Disputed Claims of Holders in Unimpaired Classes in the manner in
which the amount of such Claim and the rights of the Holder of such Claim
would have been resolved or adjudicated if the Chapter 11 Case had not been
commenced, subject to any applicable discharge and limitations on amounts of
claims and remedies available under bankruptcy law. Claims may
be subsequently compromised, settled, withdrawn or resolved by Reorganized
Debtor without further order of the Court.  

 (b) Creation of Disputed Claims Reserve   

 The Disbursing Agent or the Reorganized Debtor shall establish an appropriate reserve for Disputed Claims by withholding 100% of Distributions to which holders of Disputed Claims would be entitled under the Plan if such Disputed Claims were Allowed Claims.   

 On, or as soon as practicable after, the initial Distribution date, the Reorganized Debtor shall transmit to the Disbursing Agent, and the Disbursing Agent shall reserve for the account of each holder of a Disputed Claim, any Transaction Proceeds or Distributable Amount which would otherwise be distributable to such holder on such date in accordance with the Plan were such Disputed Claim an Allowed Claim on such date, in the face amount thereof. Transaction Proceeds and a portion of the Distributable Amount shall be set aside and segregated by Class of Claims in accounts to be established and maintained by the Disbursing Agent pending resolution of such Disputed Claims.   

 (c) Distributions on Account of Disputed Claims Once They Are Allowed   

 Within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter following the Effective Date and after an initial Distribution has been made to undisputed and Allowed Claims, the Disbursing Agent will make all Distributions on account of any Disputed Claim that has become an Allowed Claim during the preceding calendar quarter, without interest. Such Distributions will be made pursuant to the provisions of the Plan governing the applicable Class.    

Section 8.07 Setoffs   

 Except with respect to claims of Reorganized Debtor released pursuant to the Plan or any contract, instrument, release, indenture or other agreement or document created in connection with, contemplated by or assumed in connection with the Plan, the Reorganized Debtor may, pursuant to section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code or applicable nonbankruptcy law, set off against any Allowed Claim and the Distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan on account of such Claim (before any Distribution is made on account of such Claim), the claims, rights and causes of action of any nature that the Reorganized Debtor may hold against the Holder of such Allowed Claim; provided, that neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the allowance of any Claim hereunder will constitute a waiver or release by Reorganized Debtor of       

any such claims, rights and causes of action that Reorganized Debtor
may possess against such Holder.   

ARTICLE IX.   

RETENTION OF JURISDICTION   

 Notwithstanding the entry of the Confirmation Order and the occurrence of the Effective Date, the Court will retain such jurisdiction over the Chapter 11 Case after the Effective Date to the full extent permitted by law, including, without limitation, jurisdiction to:   

 (a) Allow, disallow, determine, liquidate, classify, subordinate, estimate or establish the priority or secured or unsecured status of any Claim or Equity Interest, including the resolution of any request for payment of any Administrative Claim, the resolution of any objections to the allowance or priority of Claims or Equity Interests and the resolution of any dispute as to the treatment necessary to reinstate a Claim pursuant to the Plan;   

 (b) Grant or deny any applications for allowance of compensation or reimbursement of expenses authorized pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code or the Plan, for periods ending before the Effective Date;   

 (c) Resolve any matters related to the assumption or rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease to which the Debtor is a party or with respect to which the Debtor may be liable, and to hear, determine and, if necessary, liquidate any Claims arising therefrom;   

 (d) Ensure that Distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims are accomplished pursuant to the provisions of the Plan;   

 (e) Decide or resolve any motions, adversary proceedings, contested or litigated matters and any other matters and grant or deny any applications involving the Debtor, Reorganized Alterra, or the Chapter 11 Case that may be pending on the Effective Date;   

 (f) Enter such Orders as may be necessary or appropriate to implement or consummate the provisions of the Plan and all contracts, instruments, releases, indentures and other agreements or documents created in connection with the Plan, the Disclosure Statement or the Confirmation Order, except as otherwise provided herein;   

 (g) Resolve any cases, controversies, suits or disputes that may arise in connection with the consummation, interpretation or enforcement of the Plan or the Confirmation Order, including the release and injunction provisions set forth in and contemplated by the Plan and the Confirmation Order, or any entitys rights arising under or obligations incurred in connection with the Plan or the Confirmation Order;   

 (h) Subject to any restrictions on modifications provided in any contract, instrument, release, indenture or other agreement or document created in connection with the Plan, including the Merger Agreement, modify the Plan before or after the Effective Date pursuant to section 1127 of the Bankruptcy Code or modify the Disclosure Statement, the Confirmation Order or any contract, instrument, release, indenture or other agreement or       

document created in connection with the Plan, the Disclosure Statement or the
Confirmation Order; or remedy any defect or omission or reconcile
any inconsistency in any Court Order, the Plan, the Disclosure Statement,
the Confirmation Order or any contract, instrument, release, indenture or
other agreement or document created in connection with the Plan, the
Disclosure Statement or the Confirmation Order, in such manner as may be
necessary or appropriate to consummate the Plan, to the extent authorized by
the Bankruptcy Code and the Merger Agreement, if applicable;  

 (i) Issue injunctions, enter and implement other Orders or take such other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to restrain interference by any entity with consummation, implementation or enforcement of the Plan or the Confirmation Order;   

 (j) Enter and implement such Orders as are necessary or appropriate if the Confirmation Order is for any reason modified, stayed, reversed, revoked or vacated;   

 (k) Determine any other matters that may arise in connection with or relating to the Plan, the Disclosure Statement, the Confirmation Order or any contract, instrument, release, indenture or other agreement or document created in connection with the Plan, the Disclosure Statement or the Confirmation Order, except as otherwise provided in the Plan;   

 (l) Determine matters concerning local, state and federal taxes in accordance with sections 346, 505 and 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code, and to determine any tax claims that may arise against the Debtor or Reorganized Alterra as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Plan; and   

 (m) Enter an Order concluding the Chapter 11 Case.   

 The foregoing list is illustrative only and not intended to limit in any way the Courts exercise of jurisdiction. If the Court abstains from exercising jurisdiction or is otherwise without jurisdiction over any matter arising out of the Chapter 11 Case, including without limitation the matters set forth in this Article, this Article shall have no effect upon and shall not control, prohibit, or limit the exercise of jurisdiction by any other court having competent jurisdiction with respect to such matter.

Prior to the Effective Date, the Debtor may make appropriate technical adjustments and modifications to the Plan without further order or approval of the Court, provided that such technical adjustments and modifications do not adversely affect in a material way the treatment of holders of Claims. In addition, after the Confirmation Date, so long as such action does not materially adversely affect the treatment of holders of Claims under the Plan, Reorganized Alterra may institute proceedings in the Court to remedy any defect or omission or reconcile any inconsistencies in the Plan or the Confirmation Order, with respect to such matters as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and effects of the Plan.
