Such financial statements (collectively, the &quot;Debtor Financial Statements&quot;), (i) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &quot;SEC&quot;) with respect thereto; (ii) have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (&quot;GAAP&quot;) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto and, in the case of interim financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act); (iii) fairly present the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Debtor as of the respective dates thereof and for the periods referred to therein; and (iv) are consistent with the books and records of the Debtor, subject, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), (a) to the paragraph in the report of independent auditors on the Audited Debtor Financial Statements describing conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Debtor's ability to continue as a going concern, and (b) to the Debtor Financial Statements not including any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  The schedules of assets and liabilities filed with the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Proceeding, as amended, include a list which is true and complete in all material respects of all the material creditors, indicating whether secured or unsecured, of the Debtor at the Filing Date.</P>

<P align="center"><FONT size="2"><B>CLASSIFICATION OF CLAIMS AND EQUITY INTERESTS</B>
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a designation of the Classes of Claims and Equity
Interests under the Plan. In accordance with section 1123(a)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code, Administrative Claims and Priority Tax Claims have not been
classified and are excluded from the following Classes. A Claim or Equity
Interest is classified in a particular Class only to the extent that the Claim
or Equity Interest qualifies within the description of that Class, and is
classified in another Class or Classes to the extent that any remainder of the
Claim or Equity Interest qualifies within the description of such other Class
or Classes. A Claim or Equity Interest is classified in a particular Class
only to the extent that the Claim or Equity Interest is an Allowed Claim or
Allowed Equity Interest in that Class and has not been paid, released or
otherwise satisfied before the Effective Date; a Claim or Equity Interest that
is not an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest is not in any Class. A
Disputed Claim or Disputed Equity Interest, to the extent that it subsequently
becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed Equity Interest, shall be included in the
Class for which it would have qualified had it not been disputed.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, no Distribution
shall be made on account of any Claim or Equity Interest that is not an Allowed
Claim or an Allowed Equity Interest.
