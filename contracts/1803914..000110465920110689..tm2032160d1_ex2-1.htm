Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, respectively, shall each use
its respective best efforts to take all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate to effectuate the Merger under the DGCL at the time specified in
_Section 1.3_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to
all properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of
either of the constituent corporations, the officers of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of each constituent
corporation or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and
necessary action.

  



  

Section 1.11.   _Section 368 Reorganization_. For U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The
parties to this Agreement hereby (i) adopt this Agreement insofar as
it relates to the Merger as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(g) of the United States Treasury regulations, (ii) agree to
file and retain such information as shall be required under Section 1.368-3 of

Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law, provided, however, that in the event that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, determines that it must deduct or
withhold any such amounts (except in the case of any compensatory payments
made to employees subject to wage withholding), Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall provide at least five Business Days' prior
written notice thereof to the Company, including a reasonably detailed
explanation therefor, and shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in
responding to any requests for information or clarification made by the
Company in respect thereof. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authorities, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid
to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate any such withholding
including requesting and providing recipients of consideration a reasonable
opportunity to provide documentation establishing exemptions from or
reductions of such withholdings.

 MERGER CONSIDERATION

  

Section 2.1.   _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Two
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date (by 8:00PM Eastern
Time), the Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule setting forth each
Stockholder, Optionholder and RSU Holder as of the Closing, such
Stockholder's, Optionholder's and RSU Holder's respective percentage of the
Merger Consideration (the " _Stockholder Allocation Schedule_ "). If there is
any change to the Stockholder Allocation Schedule between the time of such
delivery and the Closing, the Company shall promptly deliver an updated
Stockholder Allocation Schedule to Parent. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and automatically
converted into the right to receive, without interest, the respective
percentage of the Merger Consideration issuable to the Stockholders
in accordance with the Stockholder Allocation Schedule. _Schedule 2.1_ sets
forth a non-binding example of the Stockholder Allocation Schedule assuming
the inputs set forth therein.

Section 2.2.   _Net Debt Adjustment_. Two Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date (the date of such calculation, the  "
_Net Debt Calculation Date_ "), the Company shall deliver to Parent the
calculation of Net Debt (by 8:00PM Eastern Time). The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted as follows to account for the Net Debt:

  



  

(a)  If Net Debt is greater than $142,100,000 (the " _Net Debt
Target_ "), then the Merger Consideration shall be reduced at a rate of one
share of Parent Common Stock for each $10.00 increment that the Net Debt is
greater than the Net Debt Target.

  



  

(b)  If Net Debt is less than the Net Debt Target, then the
Merger Consideration shall be increased at a rate of one share of Parent
Common Stock for each $10.00 increment that the Net Debt is less than the Net
Debt Target.

  



  

(c)  If Net Debt equals the Net Debt Target, then no adjustment
will be made to the Merger Consideration.

  

Any adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ or
_Section 2.2(b)_ shall be in whole shares of Parent Common Stock and no
adjustment shall be made for any divergence that is in an increment of $9.99
or less.

  



  

Section 2.3.   _Effect on Capital Stock of the Company_.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, any shares of Company Common Stock
then held by the Company (or held in the Company's treasury) shall be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

  



  

Section 2.4.   _Effect on Company Options and RSUs_.

  



  

(a)  Prior to the Effective Time, and prior to the termination
of the RSUs as described in _Section 2.4(c)_ , the Company shall take all
action reasonably necessary to accelerate the vesting of each Company Option
and each RSU that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, such that each Company Option and RSU shall be fully vested
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each
outstanding Company Option shall be assumed by Parent and
automatically converted into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common
Stock (each an " _Assumed Option_ "). The number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) that are subject to each
Assumed Option shall be equal to the product of (x) the Merger Consideration
and (y) the Optionholder's respective percentage of the Merger
Consideration set forth in the Stockholder Allocation Schedule, at an
exercise price per one share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a) the
aggregate exercise price of the Assumed Options (the " _Aggregate Assumed
Option Exercise Price_ ") by (b) the total number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to the Assumed Options. Each Assumed Option will continue to be
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Plan and
its applicable grant agreement (except any references therein to the Company
or shares of Company Common Stock will instead mean the Parent and shares of
Parent Common Stock, respectively). Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such reservation
for so long as any Assumed Options remain outstanding, a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of such Assumed
Options. The assumption of Company Options pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_
shall be effected in a manner intended to satisfy the requirements of Sections
409A and 424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder.

  



  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time, all RSUs that are then outstanding shall be
terminated in a manner intended to satisfy the plan termination requirements
of Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C), and shall be subsequently paid
in the form of Parent Common Stock as provided in this _Section 2.4(c)_.
Following such termination, no further awards under the Company Stock Plan
that constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" that would be aggregated
with the terminated RSUs under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(ix)(C)(5) will
be issued.

  



  

(i)  As required by Treasury Regulation
1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C)(3), the terminated RSUs shall be settled in shares of
Parent Common Stock upon the first to occur of (i) within ten (10) days
following the first anniversary of the date that the Company takes
all necessary action to irrevocably terminate and liquidate the RSUs, or (ii)
the date that the RSUs would have been settled in accordance with their
original terms.

  



  

(ii)  The number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be
issued in settlement of each RSU shall be equal to the product of (x) the
Merger Consideration, and (y) the terminated RSU Holder's respective
percentage of the Merger Consideration as set forth in the Stockholder
Allocation Schedule. Prior to its settlement in shares of Parent Common Stock,
each terminated RSU will continue to be subject to any remaining relevant
terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Plan (except that
any references therein to the Company or shares of Company Common Stock will
instead mean the Parent and shares of Parent Common Stock, respectively).
Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for future
issuance, and shall maintain such reservation for so long as the payment
obligation for any terminated RSUs remains outstanding, a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon the settlement of such
terminated RSUs.

  



  

(d)  At the Effective Time, no former holder of Company Options
or terminated RSUs will have any rights to acquire Company Common Stock.

(e)   Not later than immediately before the Effective Time, (i)
the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each
Optionholder or RSU Holder such holder's consent in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit I_  (an " _Option/RSU Acknowledgment Agreement_
") to the application of this _Section 2.4_ to all of such holder's Company
Options and RSUs, including an acknowledgment that such holder will not
exercise any Assumed Option until Parent has filed an effective Form S-8 (or
other applicable form) with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") and (ii) the Company and Parent shall take any
other actions that are reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide for the
effects contemplated by this _Section 2.4_ , including delivering all
required notices, obtaining all necessary consents, and making any
determinations and/or resolutions of the Company board of directors, Parent
board of directors, or any committee thereof. Within two Business Days
following the expiration of the sixty (60) day period following the date
Parent has filed current Form 10 information with the SEC reflecting its
status as an entity that is not a shell company, Parent shall file an
effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with
respect to the Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of Assumed Options and
RSUs, and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement(s) (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for at least so
long as Assumed Awards remain outstanding and until RSUs are settled in
shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(f)  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring
Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates to continue any specific
benefit plan or program, or to continue the employment of any specific person.
No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to create any right to any
compensation or benefits on the part of any Option Holder or RSU Holder in
respect of their Company Options and/or RSUs, as applicable, other than the
consideration specifically provided in this _Section 2.4_.

  



  

Section 2.5.   _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_ _._ Each
share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and
without further action on the part of Parent, be converted into and become
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the shares of
Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub capital stock are
so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporation's capital
stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time).
Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common stock
will, as of the Effective Time, evidence ownership of such share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.6.   _Issuance of the Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a)   _No Issuance of Fractional Shares_. No certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued
pursuant to the Merger, and instead any such fractional share that would
otherwise be issued will be rounded to the nearest whole share, with a
Stockholder's portion of the Merger Consideration that would result in a
fractional share of 0.50 or greater rounding up and a Stockholder's portion
of the Merger Consideration that would result in a fractional share of less
than 0.50 rounding down.

  



  

(b)   _Legend_. Each certificate issued pursuant to the Merger
to the Stockholders shall bear the legends set forth below, or legends
substantially equivalent thereto, together with any other legends that may be
required by any securities Laws at the time of the issuance of the Merger
Consideration, as applicable, and if uncertificated, such legends shall be
given in writing or via electronic transmission within a reasonable time
after the issuance or transfer of such shares, as required by the DGCL:

THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
"ACT"), AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR
HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL (I) SUCH OFFER, SALE, TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR
HYPOTHECATION HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR (II) THE ISSUER OF THE
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN FORM AND
SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER, PLEDGE
OR HYPOTHECATION IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT.

  



  

(c)   _ _Exchange Fund__. On the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Continental for the benefit of
the Stockholders, for exchange in accordance with this _ARTICLE II,_ the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (such shares of Parent
Common Stock, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Parent shall cause Continental,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to pay the Merger Consideration out of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with the Stockholder Allocation Schedule and
the other applicable provisions contained in this Agreement. The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose other than as contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

(d)   _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as practicable following
the Effective Time, and in any event within two Business Days following the
Effective Time (but in no event prior to the Effective Time), Parent shall
cause Continental to deliver to each Stockholder, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, represented by certificate or book-entry, a letter of
transmittal and instructions for use in exchanging such Stockholder's shares
of Company Common Stock for such Stockholder's applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "),
and promptly following receipt of a Stockholder's properly executed Letter of
Transmittal, deliver such Stockholder's applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration to such Stockholder.

  



  

(e)   _Adjustments_. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
occurring prior to the date the Merger Consideration is issued.

  



  

(f)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund relating to the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed
to the Stockholders for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any Stockholders who have not theretofore
complied with this _Section 2.6_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for
their portion of the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by Stockholders as of a date which is immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.7.   _No Liability_. The Parties agree that Parent shall be
entitled to rely conclusively on information set forth in the Stockholder
Allocation Schedule and any amounts delivered by Parent to an applicable
Stockholder in accordance with the Stockholder Allocation Schedule shall be
deemed for all purposes to have been delivered to the applicable Stockholder
in full satisfaction of the obligations of Parent under this Agreement and
Parent shall not be responsible or liable for the calculations or the
determinations regarding such calculations set forth therein.

and any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal

Section 7.2. _Sale of Insider Shares; Compliance Failure_.

  



  

(a) The Company will purchase 700,000 of the Insider Shares held by
Sponsor (the " _Initial Shares_ ") at a price of $6.35 per Initial Share for
an aggregate purchase price of $4,445,000 (the " _Insider Sale Purchase Price_
") pursuant to a stock purchase agreement between the Sponsor, Suying Liu and
the Company dated as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Insider Share
Subscription Agreement_ "). The Parties acknowledge that the Company
transferred $1,000,000 as a deposit toward the Insider Sale Purchase Price
into an escrow account maintained at the offices of the Escrow Agent (the "
_Escrow Account_ ") pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The
Parties further acknowledge that, immediately prior to the date hereof,
the Company deposited the balance of the Insider Sale Purchase Price in the
amount of $3,445,000 into the Escrow Account. Simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, Parent and Company have delivered a joint
instruction letter to the Escrow Agent confirming that this Agreement has
been executed and to release the Insider Sale Purchase Price to Sponsor, and
Parent has delivered (i) to its transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer and
Trust Company (" _Continental_ "), an irrevocable instruction letter
(together with duly completed and medallion-guaranteed stock powers and
transfer instructions from the Sponsor and the Insider Share Subscription
Agreement) instructing Continental to transfer on the transfer books of the
Parent, upon the Closing or if this Agreement is terminated, upon the
consummation of any other business combination (as defined in Parent's
Organizational Documents), the Initial Shares (and, if applicable, the
Balance Shares) to the Company, and (ii) to the Escrow Agent to hold
in escrow executed resignation letters of all officers and directors of
Parent (the " _Resignation Letters_ "), which Resignation Letters shall only
be effective upon release to the Parent board of directors in the event of the
earlier of (A) a Compliance Failure or (B) immediately prior to Closing to
satisfy the condition set forth in _Section 8.3(l)_. From the date hereof
until the Closing Date, Parent shall (i) timely file its periodic reports
under the Exchange Act with the SEC, (ii) timely prepare and file the Proxy
Statement to conduct the Parent Stockholder Meeting in accordance with this
Agreement; (iii) respond to any and all SEC comments related to the Proxy
Statement within a reasonable period of time (but in any event, not later
than 20 days from receipt of SEC comments), and (iv) fully comply in all
respects with the provisions of this Agreement (the failure to comply with
each, a " _Compliance Failure_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent's
failure to meet the closing condition set forth in Section 8.3(o) will not be
considered a Compliance Failure.

  



  

(b) In the event of a Compliance Failure that is not cured within 30
days, (x) the Company may elect, upon written notice from the Company to the
Escrow Agent, that the Resignation Letters be released to the Parent board of
directors for all of the directors (with the exception of Suying Liu, who
shall remain on the Parent board of directors for the sole purpose of
appointing such directors that the Company designates to fill the vacancies
created at Parent, and immediately thereafter, Suying Liu's
resignation letter shall become effective) and all of the officers of Parent
and (y) the Company may elect, upon written notice to Parent and Suying Liu,
to have transferred from Suying Liu to the Company additional Insider Shares
in an amount not to exceed $1,000,000 for out-of-pocket expenses actually and
reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger, which shall be valued at a price per share equal to the closing price
per share of Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq on the date immediately prior to
the Closing Date or, if this Agreement is terminated, the date that another
business combination is consummated as defined in Parent's Organizational
Documents), as applicable (the " _Balance Shares_ "), and if the Company
makes the election in clause (y), then Parent shall promptly deliver an
additional irrevocable instruction letter instructing Continental to transfer
on the transfer books of the Parent, upon the Closing or if this Agreement is
terminated, upon the consummation of any other business combination (as
defined in Parent's Organizational Documents), the Balance Shares to the
Company. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, if there is a Compliance
Failure which is the direct result of delays by the Company in providing
information requested or required for the filing of the Proxy Statement or
the response to the SEC Comments, Parent shall not be obligated to release
the Resignation Letters and the Company shall not be eligible to elect to have
Balance Shares transferred to it.

(c) In the event that the Initial Shares and/or Balance Shares are
subject to contractual lock-up, in the event that the per share price of
Parent Common Stock on the first Business Day immediately prior to such lock-
up expiration is lower than the price per share at the time of the business
combination, then additional Insider Shares, if any, shall be transferred from
Suying Liu to the Company at the expiration of such lock-up period as
necessary such that the total aggregate amount of Insider Shares transferred
to the Company has a value of at least $4,445,000 (or, if Balance Shares are
issuable, at least $5,445,000) as valued at a price per share equal to the
closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq on the first Business
Day immediately prior to the expiration of such lock-up period.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the Merger (including the satisfaction,
but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in ___ARTICLE VIII_ ).
Without limiting the foregoing, Parent will take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain consents of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate
the Transactions.

  



  

(b) In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other
Person is commenced which questions the validity or legality of the Merger or
seeks damages in connection therewith, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against
such Proceeding and, if an injunction or other Order is issued in any such
Proceeding, to use reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or other
Order lifted, and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to
the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall
require, or be construed to require, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates to agree to (i) sell, hold, divest, discontinue
or limit, before or after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses or
interests of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates; (ii) any conditions relating to, or changes or restrictions in,
the operations of any such assets, businesses or interests; or (iii) any
modification or waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain or provide, as applicable, at the earliest practicable date,
all consents, approvals and notices listed in _Schedule 7.3(d)_. The Company
shall keep Parent apprised of its efforts undertaken by reason of this
_Section 7.3(d)_ and the results of such efforts including by giving Parent
copies of consents obtained and notices provided.

  



  

Section 7.4. _PIPE Financing_. Parent and Merger Sub shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to enter into Subscription Agreements of
at least an aggregate of $75,000,000 of Parent Common Stock in the PIPE
Financing and to consummate the purchases contemplated by the Subscription
Agreements on the terms and conditions described or contemplated therein.

SEC, and with all other applicable regulatory bodies, proxy materials for the
purpose of soliciting proxies from holders of Parent Common Stock to, among
other things, vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger and the other Parent Proposals at the Parent

its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement,
and, in each case, shall consult with the Company and its counsel concerning
any such correspondence. Parent shall not file any response letters to any
comments from the SEC without the prior written consent of the Company, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent will

achieve the foregoing.

(f) Concurrently with the dissemination of the Proxy Statement,
Parent shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange

would permit Parent to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001,
all in accordance with and as required by Parent's Organizational Documents,
applicable Law, and any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (the "
_Offer_ "). In accordance with Parent's Organizational Documents, the

Public Shares held by Parent Public Stockholders who have elected to redeem

the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _ARTICLE

with applicable Law and Parent's Organizational Documents, after the Proxy
Statement is "cleared" by the SEC. Parent shall take reasonable measures to
ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with Parent Stockholders'
Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if on the date of the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting, or a date preceding the date on which the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting is scheduled, Parent reasonably believes that (i) it
will not receive proxies sufficient to obtain the Parent Required Vote for
each Parent Proposal, whether or not a quorum would be present or (ii) it
will not have sufficient Parent Common Stock represented (whether in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Parent Stockholders' Meeting, Parent may postpone or adjourn, or make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of, the Parent Stockholders'
Meeting in compliance with the DGCL and Parent's Certificate of
Incorporation, as long as the date of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 30 calendar days in

Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, the Merger and the Transactions
shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, except with
respect to the fees for the HSR Filing (" _HSR Filing Fee_ "), which shall be
paid by the Company.

any other provision in this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
