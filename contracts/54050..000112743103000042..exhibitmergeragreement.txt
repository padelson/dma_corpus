case of Shares, to the product of (i) the number of Shares held by such

the amounts set forth in Section 3.1(e).   (f)......No Further Ownership

and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for cash, if

of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Warrants or
Company Stock Options, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction

of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, (ii)
compliance with the notification and waiting period requirements of the HSR
Act, (iii) such filings as may be required by any applicable state securities

(a)......At the Closing, Parent, MergerCo and/or the Company will
have sufficient cash funds on hand to fund all obligations of Parent,
MergerCo and the Company with respect to the Merger and all related fees and
expenses.   (b)......Immediately following the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent. For purposes of this Agreement, "Solvent" when

of its assets will, as of such date, exceed all of its liabilities,
contingent or otherwise, as of such date, (ii) the Surviving Corporation will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the

and the timing of and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its
indebtedness. The term "Solvency" shall have its correlative meaning. For
purposes of the definition of "Solvent," (A) "Debt" means liability on a
"Claim;" and (B) "Claim" means (i) any right to payment, whether or not such
a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or
unsecured or (ii) the right to an equitable remedy for breach on performance
if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not
such equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal,
equitable, secured or unsecured. "Present Fair Salable Value" means the
amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of the Surviving
Corporation (including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable
promptness in an arms-length transaction under present conditions for the
sale of comparable business enterprises.   Section 5.7.......No Outside

investigation or other inquiry of any Governmental Entity with respect to any

without limitation, obtaining pay-off letters and terminating security
interests under the Credit Facility, and in connection with any debt tender
offer and/or consent solicitation by Parent or MergerCo with respect to the
Notes. Notwithstanding the forgoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require
the Board of the Company to take any action to approve (i) any third party
financing provided in connection with the Merger (including any refinancing
of the Credit Facility, the Notes or the Preferred Stock) or (ii) any offer
to redeem or repurchase the Notes or the Preferred Stock (it being understood
that all such necessary approvals shall be obtained from the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation).   Section 6.6.......Public

the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
immediately after the Effective Time shall contain provisions with respect
to indemnification and exculpation from liability that are at least as
favorable to the beneficiaries of such provisions as those provisions that
are set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, respectively, on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six years following the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of Persons who at or prior to the Effective Time
were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, unless such modification is required by law and (ii) all rights
to indemnification as provided in any indemnification agreements with any
current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger.

indemnification thereunder) who are currently covered by the Company\'s
existing officers\' and directors\' or fiduciary liability insurance policies
set forth on Section 6.7(b) of the Disclosure Letter on terms no less
advantageous to such indemnified parties than such existing insurance;
provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual
premiums for such insurance in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid
prior to the date of this Agreement (which premium is set forth on Section
6.7(b) of the Disclosure Letter).   (c)......The Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless (and shall advance expenses to), to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, each director, officer and employee of

reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
disbursements), judgments, penalties, fines and settlements in connection
with any threatened, pending or completed civil, criminal, administrative,
arbitration or investigative proceeding relating to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and in the event of any such proceeding (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), the parties hereto will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed.  
(d)......The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including attorneys\' fees that may be incurred by any indemnified
parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this
Section 6.7 to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.   (f)......This Section 6.7,
which shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time and
shall continue for the periods specified herein, is intended to benefit the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, and any Person or entity referenced in
this Section 6.7 or indemnified hereunder, each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this Section 6.7 (whether or not parties to this
Agreement).   Section 6.8.......Stock Option Plans. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary within its reasonable
control to ensure that all of the Company\'s stock option or other equity-
based plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in
any other compensation or benefit plan providing for the issuance, transfer
or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest in respect of
any capital stock of the Company shall be terminated as of the Effective
Time, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that
following the Effective Time the Company is not bound by any Company Stock
Option which would entitle any Person, other than Parent or its Affiliates,
to beneficially own, or receive any payments (other than as otherwise
contemplated by Section 3.1) in respect of, any capital stock of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation.   Section 6.9.......Solvency Opinion. To the
extent a written "solvency opinion" is being obtained for any third-party
financing source of Parent and MergerCo, Parent shall deliver at the Closing
copies of that opinion addressed to the Company and significant shareholders
of the Company as designated by the Company.   Section 6.10......No
Solicitation. Except as set forth below, the Company shall not, directly or
indirectly, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any information or access to, any person or group (other
than Parent, MergerCo or any of their Affiliates or associates) concerning
any merger, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock or similar
transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary or division of the
Company. The Company will notify Parent promptly if any discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated, any inquiry or proposal is made,
or any such information is requested in respect of any such transaction and
will promptly communicate to Parent the terms of any material proposal,
discussion, negotiation or inquiry which it may receive in respect of any
such transaction and the identity of the offeror or potential offeror. The
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than Parent, MergerCo or any of their Affiliates or
associates) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Company receives an unsolicited
inquiry or proposal from any person or group for the acquisition of all or
substantially all of the assets or outstanding shares of the Company which
the Board reasonably believes in good faith is capable of being completed,
taking into account all legal, financial regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and the person making the proposal and (ii) the Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to
respond to such inquiry or proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Company\'s shareholders (an "Alternative Transaction"), then
the Company may, directly or indirectly, furnish information and
access pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement and may
participate in discussions and negotiate with such person or group. The
Company agrees not to release any third party from, or waive any provisions
of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company may be a
party, unless the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel) that failing to release such third party or waive such
provisions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
shareholders.   Section 6.11......Notification of Certain Matters. The
Company shall give notice to Parent and Parent shall give notice to the
Company, promptly upon becoming aware of (a) any occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur has caused or is
reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time and (b) any material failure on its
part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided that the delivery of any

has terminated such Contracts pursuant to this Section 6.12 providing that

such terminated Contracts.   Section 6.13......Transaction Expenses. No

8.1.......Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after approval thereof by the shareholders of
the Company:   (a)......by unanimous written consent of Parent, MergerCo
and the Company;   (b)......by Parent, MergerCo or the Company if:   (i)
any court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;
or   (ii) the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior to
September 30, 2003; provided, however, that the right to terminate the
Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or
before such date;   (c)......by Parent or MergerCo in the event (i) of a
material breach by the Company of this Agreement which has not been cured
within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the Company or which is
incapable of being cured prior to September 30, 2003, (ii) since December 28,
2002, there has occurred an event, change or condition that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company, (iii) the Merger has not been approved and adopted by the
shareholders of the Company entitled to vote thereon in accordance with the
MBCA by the date which is 30 days after the date hereof or (iv) a holder of
the Class B Common Stock, Class C Common Stock or Class D Common Stock that
is a party to a Support Agreement materially breaches Section 2 of its
Support Agreement; or   (d)......by the Company in the event of a material
breach by MergerCo or Parent of this Agreement, which has not been cured
within 30 days after the giving of written notice to MergerCo or Parent, as
the case may be, or which is incapable of being cured prior to September,
2003.   Section 8.2.......Fees and Expenses. In the event that (1) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent and MergerCo pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(iii) or (2) this Agreement is terminated by Parent and MergerCo
pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(iv) and, for purposes of this clause (2), at the
time of termination, there is a proposal for an Alternative Transaction and
the Company enters into a definitive agreement for such Alternative
Transaction within 12 months following the date of termination, then the
Company shall pay MergerCo a fee in the amount of $25,000,000 (the
"Termination Fee"). In addition, in the event that the Termination Fee
becomes payable, the Company shall reimburse MergerCo for all out-of-pocket
fees and expenses actually incurred by MergerCo, or by its Affiliates on
behalf of Parent or Merger Co, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (for purposes of clarity,
including, without limitation, any refinancing costs incurred by Parent or
MergerCo), the amount of such reimbursement not to exceed $5,000,000. The
Company acknowledges that the Termination Fee and expense reimbursement
provided for above are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and not a penalty, and that, without the Termination Fee and
expense reimbursement provided for above, MergerCo would not enter into this
Agreement. If the Company fails to pay promptly the Termination Fee and
expense reimbursement due pursuant to this Section 8.2, the Company shall
also pay to MergerCo its costs and expenses (including legal fees and
expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit
or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on
the amount of the unpaid fee under this section, accruing from its due date,
at an interest rate per annum equal to the prime commercial lending rate
quoted by The Wall Street Journal. Any change in the interest rate hereunder
resulting from a change in such prime rate shall be effective at
the beginning of the day of such change in such prime rate. The Termination
Fee and expense reimbursement shall be due within three business days after
this Agreement is terminated by Parent and MergerCo (it being understood that
the Company shall not be obligated to reimburse Parent and MergerCo for
their expenses until such time as the Company receives a detailed accounting
of such expenses).   Section 8.3.......Effect of Termination. In the event
that this Agreement is terminated and the Merger is abandoned pursuant to
Section 8.1, written notice of such termination and abandonment shall
forthwith be given to the other parties and this Agreement shall terminate
and the Merger shall be abandoned without further action. If this Agreement
is terminated as provided herein, no party hereto shall have any liability or
further obligation to any other party under the terms of this Agreement;
provided, however, that no such termination shall relieve any party for
liability resulting from any breach of this Agreement by such party;
provided, further, that the provisions of Section 8.2, this Section 8.3,
Article 9 and the penultimate sentence of Section 6.3 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.   ARTICLE 9  MISCELLANEOUS    Section
9.1.......Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a
written agreement signed by each of the parties hereto at any time prior to
the Effective Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein;
provided, however, that after this Agreement is approved by the Company\'s
shareholders, no such amendment or modification shall (a) alter or change the
amount or kind of the consideration to be delivered to the shareholders of
the Company or (b) alter or change any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement if such alteration or change would adversely affect the
shareholders of the Company.   Section 9.2.......Non-Survival of
Representations and Warranties. The respective representations and warranties
of Parent, MergerCo and the Company contained herein shall terminate upon,
and not survive, the Closing.   Section 9.3.......Waiver of Compliance;
Consents. Any failure of MergerCo or Parent, on the one hand, or the Company,
on the other hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein may, subject to Section 9.1, be waived by Parent (on behalf
of itself and MergerCo) or the Company, respectively, only by a written
instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or
failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Whenever this Agreement requires
or permits consent by or on behalf of any party hereto, such consent shall be
given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of
compliance as set forth in this Section 9.3.   Section 9.4.......Assignment.
This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided,
however, that Parent or MergerCo shall be entitled to assign its rights and
responsibilities to one or more of their Affiliates but no such assignment
shall relieve Parent or MergerCo from its obligations hereunder   Section
9.5.......Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all fees, charges and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such fees, charges or expenses. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, all HSR and Competition Act filing costs incurred by the
parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be borne equally by Parent and the Company (it being understood that
such filing costs shall not reduce the Purchase Price).   Section
9.6.......GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS
MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE
