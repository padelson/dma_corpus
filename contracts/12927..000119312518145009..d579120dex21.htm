Agreement, $63.00 per share (the _Merger Consideration_ ). Each share of
Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Secti_ _on_ __ _ 3.01(a)_ shall no longer

Page 16 any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as contemplated by

   3.02 | Exchange of Certificates 
---|--- 



   (a) | Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Payment Fund 
---|--- 

Prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into a customary paying agent
agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent (the _Paying Agent_ ) for the payment of
the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)(ii)_. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Paying Agent, for payment in accordance with this _Article III_
through the Paying Agent, cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the
Merger Consideration (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that
such aggregate amount shall not include any amounts payable in respect of
Company Restricted Stock Awards, Company RSU Awards or Company PSU Awards or
any shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant thereto, which amounts
Parent shall cause to be paid pursuant to _Sections 3.03(a)_ and _3.03(b)_ ,
as applicable) (the _Payment Fund_ ). In the event the Payment Fund shall at
any time be insufficient for any reason (including losses) to make the
payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)(ii)_, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or shall take all steps necessary to cause to be deposited,
additional cash with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make all payments under this Agreement.
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose not contemplated by the
terms of this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the payment
of the Merger Consideration for shares of the Company Common Stock.

 



   (b) | Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event, not
later than the third (3rd) Business Day thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ to the Paying Agent, and which
shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration _multiplied_ by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 
---|--- 



   (c) |

Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other 

---|--- 
 



Page 17 to such instructions (including receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying
Agent (or such other evidence as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in
respect of any Book-Entry Share), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall
direct the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly
as reasonably practicable, cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration
_multiplied by_ the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. The Paying Agent shall
accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying
Agent may impose. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(f)_ and  _Section_ __ _
3.05_, without prejudice to any rights in respect of the Distribution, after
the Effective Time and until so surrendered, each Certificate and Book-Entry
Share shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Company Common Stock represented thereby. 
---|--- 



   (d) | Payments to Non-Registered Holders 
---|--- 

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate
amount of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required
by the Paying Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred
and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.



   (e) | Termination of Payment Fund 
---|--- 

Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee upon demand, and any such
holders who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_  shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law) as general creditor
thereof for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration.

 



   (f) | No Liability 
---|--- 

None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any cash held in the Payment Fund delivered to a
Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not
have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any
such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



Page 18 ---|--- 

The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such investment shall relieve Parent or
the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _Article III_ , and
following any losses resulting from such investment Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee
as directed by Parent.



   (h) | Withholding 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to, without
duplication, (i) deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts otherwise payable or distributable in cash or in kind
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, as a result of the ESG Spin
Distribution) pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payments under the Code or any
provision of Applicable Tax Law and (ii) collect any forms required by
Applicable Law to comply with withholding obligations with respect to payments
made pursuant to clause (i). Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



   3.03 | Company Equity Awards 
---|--- 



   (a) | Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Awards 
---|--- 

Parent shall not assume any award of Company Common Stock subject to time-
based, performance or other vesting or lapse restrictions (each, a _Company
Restricted Stock Award_ ). Without prejudice to any rights in respect of the
Distribution, as of the Effective Time, (i) each Company Restricted Stock
Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, to
the extent not vested, become fully vested; _provided_ that to the extent that
such award is subject to performance conditions, any performance conditions
shall be deemed to have been satisfied at the maximum level and (ii) each
Company Restricted Stock Award shall be canceled without any action on the
part of any holder or beneficiary thereof in consideration for the right to
receive, in accordance with the Surviving Companys general payroll practices,
a lump sum cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the
Merger Consideration, and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Company Restricted Stock Award, less any applicable
withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by Applicable Law to be
withheld, without interest.

 



   (b) | Treatment of Company PSU Awards and Company RSU Awards 
---|--- 

Parent shall not assume any performance stock unit awards, including any
performance stock unit awards deferred under any of the Companys deferred
compensation plans or otherwise (each a _Company PSU Award_ ) or any
restricted stock unit awards, including 

 



Page 19  any stock unit awards deferred under any of the Companys deferred
compensation plans or otherwise (each a _Company RSU Award_ ). Without
prejudice to any rights in respect of the Distribution, as of the Effective
Time, each Company PSU Award and Company RSU Award, in each case, subject to
time-based, performance or other vesting restrictions that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, to the extent not vested,
become fully vested; _provided_ that to the extent that such award is subject
to performance conditions, any performance conditions shall be deemed to have
been satisfied at the maximum level and (ii) each Company PSU Award
and Company RSU Award, in each case, whether payable in cash or shares of
Company Common Stock, shall be canceled without any action of the part of any
holder or beneficiary thereof in consideration for the right to receive, in
accordance with the Surviving Companys general payroll practices, a lump sum
cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the Merger
Consideration, and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Company PSU Award or Company RSU Award, less any
applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by Applicable
Law to be withheld, without interest; _provided, further_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
payment in respect of any Company PSU Award and Company RSU Award, in each
case, which immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred
compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be converted to the
Merger Consideration and paid on the applicable settlement date for such
Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award if required in order to comply with
Section 409A of the Code.

exercised in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP upon the earlier

Effective Time or (B) the date on which such Option Period(s) would otherwise
end, and no additional Option Period(s) shall commence under such Company
ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) no individual participating in the
Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the amount of his, her or its

partial shares of Company Stock by which such compensation arrangement
is measured or deemed invested. The Company shall provide Parent with
documentation evidencing the completion of the foregoing actions not later
than the Business Day preceding the Effective Time.

 



   3.04 | Lost Certificates

has properly exercised and perfected his, her or its demand for appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or lost
such holders rights to appraisal (the _Dissenting Shares_ ), shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders
of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as
shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (it being understood
and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
other than the right to receive the "fair value" of such Dissenting Shares as
determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided, however_ ,
that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn

 



Page 21  or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL
(whether occurring before, at or after the Effective Time), such holders
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon and less any withholding Taxes,

Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and, to the extent applicable, is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character or location of the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where

have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Companys Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (the _Certificate of Incorporation_ ) and Amended
and Restated Bylaws (the _Bylaws_ ), each as amended as of the date of this
Agreement, have been made available to Parent and are in full force and

both, would give rise to any material default or material breach) under the
Agreed Form Spin-Off Agreements which the Company becomes aware, and (iii)
responding to Parents reasonable requests for updates on the status of the
Spin-Off. To the extent requested by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall

   (g) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _
6.01_, the Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the Companys operations (including for purposes of the
HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws) prior to the consummation of
the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions hereof, complete control and

   (a) |

In connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event no later
than 25 Business Days thereafter), the Company shall prepare and file the
Company Proxy Statement with the SEC. If the Company determines that it is
required, pursuant to Applicable Law, to file any document other than the
Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an _Other Required Company Filing_ ), then the
Company shall promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing
with the SEC. Each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish the Company the
information relating to it that is required to be set forth in the Company
Proxy Statement so that the Company Proxy Statement, at the date it is first
mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, shall not contain any misstatement of a material fact, or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in
each case, in respect of statements related to Parent and Merger Sub. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Proxy
Statement and any Other Required Company Filing at the date that it (and any
amendment or supplement thereto) is first published, sent or given to the
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, to comply as to form and substance in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and, the rules and 

---|--- 
 



Page 55 and NASDAQ and, on each such applicable date, neither the Company Proxy
Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, _provided_ that no covenant or representation
is made with respect to any information provided by Parent, Merger Sub, or
any of their affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filings. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve, and each Party agrees to consult and
cooperate with the other Party in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to
the Company Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing as promptly
as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the Company
Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing in definitive form to be
cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable following filing with the SEC. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub, and the Company agrees to correct any information (and to notify the
other Parties of any fact, change, or event underlying such correction)
provided by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement and any Other Required
Company Filing so that the Company Proxy Statement and any Other Required
Company Filing would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the Company
shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders, with Parents written
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, an amendment or supplement setting forth such correction and
promptly file any required amendment of, or supplement to, such correction
with the SEC and, as required by Applicable Law, disseminate the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to the Companys stockholders. 
---|--- 



   (b) |

As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and file the ESG Registration Statement with the SEC.
If the Company determines that it is required, pursuant to Applicable Law, to
file any document other than (or in addition to) the ESG Registration
Statement with the SEC in connection with the Spin-Off (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an _Other ESG Required Company Filing_ ), then the
Company shall promptly prepare and file such Other ESG Required Company Filing
with the SEC. The Company shall cause the ESG Registration Statement and any
Other ESG Required Company Filing at the date that it (and any amendment or
supplement thereto) is first declared effective by the SEC, (i) to comply as
to form and substance in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and the
rules of the SEC and NASDAQ and (ii) not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
all SEC comments with respect to the ESG Registration Statement and any Other
ESG Required Company Filing and to cause the ESG Registration Statement and
any Other ESG Required Company Filing in definitive form to be cleared by the
SEC, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company has the sole right to

correspondence in connection with the review by the SEC of the ESG
Registration Statement and the Other ESG Required Company Filings.

   (c) | The Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable: (i) notify
Parent of the receipt of any comments from the SEC for any amendment to the
Company Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing, the
ESG Registration Statement or any Other ESG Required Company Filing, or for
additional information; and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written
correspondence between the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Company Proxy Statement or any Other ESG Required Company
Filing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Company
Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing, the ESG Registration
Statement or any Other ESG Required Company Filing (or any amendments thereto)
or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company
shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, (x) provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review the Company Proxy Statement, Other Required Company
Filing, the ESG Registration Statement or any Other ESG Required Company
Filing or any response thereto (including the proposed final version of the
Company Proxy Statement, Other Required Company Filing, the ESG Registration
Statement or any Other ESG Required Company Filing) and (y) shall consider in
good faith all comments thereto reasonably proposed by Parent. 
---|--- 
 



   (d) |

The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which
the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Company Proxy
Statement (the _SEC Clearance Date_ ), in accordance with Applicable Law and
the Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a special meeting of the Companys stockholders (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the _Company Stockholder Meeting_ ) for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company
Stockholder Approval shall, without the prior written consent of Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), be the
only non-procedural matter proposed to be acted on by the Companys
stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall file the
definitive Company Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the definitive
Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of the Company stock as of
the record date established for the Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after the SEC
Clearance Date and in advance of such meeting; _provided_ that if the SEC has
failed to affirmatively notify the Company by the date that is ten (10)
calendar days after the initial filing of the Company Proxy Statement with the
SEC that it will or will not be reviewing the Company Proxy Statement, then
such date shall be the _SEC Clearance Date_. Except to the extent that the
Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as
expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, the Company Proxy Statement
shall include the Company Recommendation. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_,
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit the Companys
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Merger and the other Transactions. The Company shall keep Parent and
Merger Sub updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as and when
requested by Parent or

Page 57 called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the written consent of Parent (other than: (A) in
order to obtain a quorum of its stockholders, (B) to allow reasonable
additional time after the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosures to the Company Proxy Statement, or (C) for compliance with
Applicable Law or an Order from the SEC), and in no event more than twice
(without the written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the event that the Company Stockholder
Meeting as originally called is for any reason adjourned or postponed or
otherwise delayed, the Company agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise
approved in writing, it shall implement such postponement or adjournment or
other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish a new record
date for the Company Stockholder Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or
delayed, except as required by Applicable Law. If the Company Board makes a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change as expressly permitted pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.05_, it will not alter the obligation of the Company to
submit the Company Stockholder Approval to Companys stockholders at the
Company Stockholder Meeting to consider and vote upon, unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to
the Company Stockholder Meeting.

   6.03 | Regulatory Authorizations and Consents; Efforts 
---|--- 



   (a) | The Company and Parent agree that, as of the date hereof, the
only notifications and approvals required to be filed and obtained under
Antitrust Laws in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are the filings and corresponding approvals in the
jurisdictions set out in _Annex 6.03(a)_ (such notifications and approvals,
together with any such notifications and approvals arising after the date
hereof (it being understood that such notifications and approvals arising
after the date hereof shall not be deemed to be a condition to any Partys
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby), the _Required
Notifications_ ). 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | Subject to clause (d) below, each of the Parties will use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other and to take, or cause to
be taken, or do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, all conditions to the
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement over which it has control or
influence, to obtain all other necessary actions, waivers, consents, licenses,
permits and registrations (or transfers of the foregoing) and approvals from
Governmental Authorities or any other Person (it being understood that such
actions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits and registrations shall not be
deemed to be a condition to any Partys obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby unless otherwise set forth in _Article VII_
), and to cause the Merger to be consummated as promptly as practicable in
accordance with the terms hereof. In addition, each of the Parties shall use
its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court by any Party in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any Order of any Governmental Authority (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Closing.

Page 58 required under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable, but in any event no
later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and
Parent shall prepare and file all other Required Notifications as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. In no event will any
Party request or otherwise seek early termination of any applicable waiting
periods under applicable Antitrust Law without the other Partys prior
written consent. 
---|--- 



   (d) | Notwithstanding Parents covenants otherwise set out in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.03_, Parent will not be required to propose, negotiate,
commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise
regarding, (i) the sale, divestiture, license or disposition, in whole or in
part of, or suffer any restriction on the operation of, Parents or its
Subsidiaries assets, properties or businesses; or (ii) the
sale, divestiture, license, or disposition, in whole or part of the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired by Parent pursuant hereto. 
---|--- 



   (e) | To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Party shall
promptly notify the other of any material communication (including oral
communications) it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority to the extent relating to this Agreement and the Transactions and
permit the other to review in advance any proposed material communication by
such Party to any Governmental Authority. Neither of the Parties shall
participate in or agree to participate in any material meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation (including any
settlement of any such investigation), litigation or other inquiry related to
the Required Notifications unless it consults with the other in advance and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. To the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, each Party will coordinate and cooperate fully with each
other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
other may reasonably request in connection with the Required Notifications;
_provided_ that the disclosing Party may, where appropriate, limit disclosure
of any information to those individuals acting as outside counsel for the
other Parties, and such counsel will not disclose such information to such
other Parties without the knowledge and consent of Parent or the Company, as
applicable). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Parent has the sole right to control and direct all antitrust filings and
antitrust strategy in connection with review of the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby by any Governmental Authority, or any
litigation by, or negotiations with, any antitrust authority or other Person
relating to the transaction under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and
will take the lead in all meetings, discussions, and communications with
any Governmental Authority relating to obtaining antitrust approval for the
Transaction, provided that Parent will consult with and consider in good faith
the comments of the Company in connection with any filing, communication,
defense, litigation, negotiation, or strategy. Subject to this _Section_ __ _
6.03(e)_ and the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Parties will provide each other with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions; _provided_ that __ materials may be redacted by any Party: (i)
as necessary to comply with Applicable Law, or (ii) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

Until the Closing and upon reasonable advance written notice from Parent, the
Company will allow Parent and its Representatives reasonable access, at
Parents expense, during normal business hours, under the supervision of
personnel of the Company, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives
and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of the business of the Company to (a) such materials and
information (including Contracts, properties, books, Tax Returns, work papers
and records) about the Ex-ESG Company as Parent may reasonably request and (b)
specified members of management of the business of the Ex-ESG Company as the
Parties may reasonably agree, and which shall in any event include the
individuals set forth on _Schedule 6.04_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that
except as required by Applicable Law, Parent shall not initiate any one-on-one
discussion with any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries regarding such
employees potential compensation following the Closing without the prior
written consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be required
to disclose any information to Parent or its Representatives if such
disclosure would be reasonably likely, after consultation with counsel, to:
(i) result in the loss of any attorney-client or other legal privilege (it
being agreed that the Company will notify Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such information on such basis and will provide a description of
such information, and shall use reasonable best efforts to allow disclosure
of such information in a manner that does not result in the loss of any such
privilege, including entering into a joint defense agreement or other
agreements or arrangements) or (ii) contravene any Applicable Law (including
Antitrust Laws). In no event shall Parent be permitted to conduct any invasive
testing of the Company Owned Real Property or the Company Leased Real Property
or the building, or improvements thereon, including sampling of soil,
sediment, groundwater, surface water or building material. Parent will, and
will cause its Representatives to, hold all information so obtained in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation
or access permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ shall affect or be
deemed to modify or cure any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation
or warranty made by the Company hereunder.

provided by or on behalf of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their
Representatives to any and all such third parties.

   (b) | Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receiving the
Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives a bona fide written
Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result directly or indirectly from
a breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.05(a)_ (other than breaches thereof that are
inadvertent, de minimis and not intended to result in a Company Acquisition
Proposal), then the Company may: (i) contact the Person who has made
such Company Acquisition Proposal in order to clarify the terms of such
Company Acquisition Proposal so that the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) may inform itself about such Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii)

Person, but only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with confidentiality
terms that are not less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (iii) negotiate and participate in discussions
and negotiations with such Person concerning such Company Acquisition
Proposal, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), if (x) the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside financial advisors

could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in, a Superior Proposal and
(y) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside financial advisors and legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law. The Company (A) shall promptly (and in any case within twenty-four (24)
hours) provide Parent notice of the receipt of any Company Acquisition
Proposal and any confidentiality agreement entered into with any third party,
and shall disclose the identity of the third party (or parties) and the terms
of such Company Acquisition Proposal (including, in the case of written
terms, copies of any Alternative Acquisition Agreement and materials
containing the material terms of such Alternative Acquisition Agreement and,
in the case of oral terms, a reasonable description of the material terms
thereof), (B) shall promptly (and in any case within twenty-four (24) hours)
make available to Parent copies of all information of the Company and the same
access provided by the Company to such third party but not previously
made available to Parent, and (C) shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably
prompt (and at Parents request, which shall not be more frequently than
daily) basis of the status and material details of (including amendments and
proposed amendments to and the negotiations or discussion of) any such
Company Acquisition Proposal, or such other inquiry, offer or proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not, shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to and shall instruct and cause its officers, directors and
other Representatives not to, provide any commercially sensitive non-public
information to any competitor of the Company in connection with the actions
permitted by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.05_, except in a manner consistent with
the Companys past practices in dealing with the disclosure of such
information in the context of considering Company Acquisition Proposals prior

Acquisition Proposal that did not result directly or indirectly from a breach
of _Section_ __ _ 6.05(a)_ (other than breaches thereof that are inadvertent,
de minimis and not intended to result in a Company Acquisition Proposal),
that is not withdrawn, and that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside financial advisors and legal counsel)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(ii)_ and
simultaneously enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement in
respect of such Superior Proposal if: (A) the Company Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside financial advisors and legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; (B) the Company has previously
notified Parent in writing that it intends to terminate this Agreement and
provided Parent an unredacted copy of the proposed definitive Alternative

Proposal; (C) for a period of four (4) Business Days following its compliance
with clause (B) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.05(d)_, the Company shall have

available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) with Parents Representatives any proposed

faith (in each case to the extent Parent desires to negotiate), with Parents
Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the
failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties under Applicable Law (it being understood and agreed
that any material change to the facts and circumstances relating to an
Intervening Event shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that
shall expire on the later to occur of (1) three (3) Business Days following
delivery of such new notice from the Company to Parent and (2) the expiration
of the original four (4) Business Days period described in this clause (iii)

approval by the stockholders of the Company without such further approval of
such stockholders nor any amendment or change not permitted under Applicable
Law.

waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any

   (a) | The Parties have participated collectively in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted collectively by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement. 
---|---

The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and words
of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,
paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are to the articles, sections and

otherwise specified, and the table of contents and headings in this Agreement

---|--- 



   9.05 | Severability 
---|--- 

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



   9.06 | Assignment 
---|--- 

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of
Applicable Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, except that any Merger Sub may assign any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or a combination thereof so long as such
assignment would not materially delay, impair or prevent consummation of the
Merger and so long as Parent remains primarily liable for Merger Subs
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any attempted assignment
in violation of this _Section_ __ _ 9.06_ shall be null and void.



   9.07 | Entire Agreement 
---|--- 

This Agreement (including the exhibits, annexes and appendices hereto and any
other agreement entered into among Parent and/or Merger Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, in connection herewith) constitutes,
together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule
and the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the entire agreement, and supersedes all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



   9.08 | No Third-Party Beneficiaries 
---|--- 

This Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other
than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that it is specifically intended that the DandO Indemnified Parties (with
respect to _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 9.08_ from and
after the Effective Time) are intended third-party beneficiaries of such
provisions.

 



Page 82 ---|--- 

This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Applicable Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Applicable Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.



   9.10 | Specific Performance 
---|--- 

Each Party agrees that that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that any Party does not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to any
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.



   9.11 | Consent to Jurisdiction 
---|--- 



   (a) | Each of the Parties hereby, with respect to any legal claim or
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (i) expressly and irrevocably submits, for itself and
with respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or
federal court within the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such courts, (iii) agrees that it will not bring
any claim or Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except in such courts and (iv) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
claim or Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees that a final and nonappealable judgment in any Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law. 
---|--- 
 



Page 83 any claim or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect hereof brought by any other Party may be made by mailing
copies thereof by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 9.03_ and such service of process shall be sufficient to
confer personal jurisdiction over such Party in such claim or Proceeding and
shall otherwise constitute effective and binding service in every respect.  
---|--- 



   9.12 | Counterparts 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, all of which shall
together be considered one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
signature page to this Agreement by electronic transmission shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



   9.13 | WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL 
---|--- 

EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) BETWEEN ANY OF THEM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.
