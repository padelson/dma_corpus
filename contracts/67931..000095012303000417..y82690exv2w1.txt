5.1(b)    -vi-    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    AGREEMENT AND PLAN
OF MERGER (hereinafter called this "Agreement"), dated as of January 16,
2003, among Wallace Computer Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), Moore Corporation Limited, a corporation continued under the laws
of Canada ("Parent"), and M-W Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub," the Company and
Merger Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Constituent Corporations").   RECITALS   WHEREAS, the respective boards
of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") and approved
the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; and   WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises,
and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   The Merger;
Closing; Effective Time; Subsequent Merger   1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective
Time (as defined in Section 1.3) Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"), and the
separate corporate existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended
(the "DGCL").   1.2. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
shall take place (i) at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell, 125 Broad Street,
New York, New York at 9:00 A.M. on the third business day after which the
last to be fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall
be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) at such
other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and Parent may
agree in writing (the "Closing Date").   1.3. Effective Time. On the
Closing Date, the Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the
"Delaware Certificate of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged   and filed
with the Secretary of State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the
Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of Delaware, unless such Delaware Certificate of Merger specifies a
different effective time in which event the Merger shall become effective at
such other specified time (the "Effective Time").   1.4. Subsequent Merger.
(a) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to merge with and into a newly created direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (the "Sister Subsidiary") and the separate corporate
existence of the Surviving Corporation shall thereupon cease (the "Subsequent
Merger") if, prior to the Effective Time: (i) the Company shall have received
the opinion of Sidley Austin Brown and Wood, special counsel to the Company,
dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, will be treated for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), that each of Parent, Sister
Subsidiary and the Company will be a party to that reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code, and that a conversion of Shares into
the Consideration provided for hereunder (other than solely for the Per Share
Cash Consideration) will be an exchange governed by Section 354 (and if
applicable Section 356) of the Code to which Section 367(a)(1) of the Code
does not apply and (ii) Parent shall have received the opinion of Sullivan and
Cromwell, special counsel to Parent, dated as of the Closing Date, to the
effect that the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, will be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, that each of Parent, Sister Subsidiary
and the Company will be a party to that reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(b) of the Code, and that a conversion of Shares into the
Consideration provided for hereunder (other than solely for the Per Share
Cash Consideration) will be an exchange governed by Section 354 (and if
applicable Section 356) of the Code to which Section 367(a)(1) of the Code
does not apply. Such opinions of counsel may be based on customary
assumptions and representations, including representations of the Company and
Parent. Each of the Company and Parent shall request its respective counsel
to render opinions to the effect described above. In the event
either party\'s counsel is unable to render opinions to the effect described
above, such counsel shall (at the request of the other party) provide a
written explanation of the substantive reason or reasons causing such counsel
to be unable to do so. To the extent either of such opinions is not received
as set forth in the previous sentence, then Parent shall have no obligation
to cause the Subsequent Merger to be consummated.   (b) At the effective
time of any Subsequent Merger, (i) Parent\'s share of common stock of Sister
Subsidiary will be converted into one newly issued, fully-paid and non-
assessable share of fixed value preferred stock of the surviving corporation
of the Subsequent Merger with a redemption amount and fair market value of
$100; (ii) Parent\'s share of fixed value preferred stock of the Surviving
Corporation will be converted into one newly issued, fully-paid and non-
assessable share of fixed value preferred stock of the surviving
corporation of the Subsequent Merger with a redemption amount and fair market
value of $100; and (iii) Parent\'s 100 shares of common stock of Surviving
Corporation will be converted into one hundred (100) shares of newly issued,
fully-paid and non-assessable common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
surviving corporation of the Subsequent Merger.     -2-    (c) If the
Subsequent Merger is effected, references herein to the Surviving Corporation
shall refer to the Sister Subsidiary.   (d) This Agreement is intended to
constitute a "plan of reorganization" with respect to the Merger and
Subsequent Merger (if consummated) for United States federal income tax
purposes pursuant to which, for such purposes, the Merger and the Subsequent
Merger (if consummated) are to be treated as a "reorganization" under Section
368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent, Sister Subsidiary and the
Company are to be parties under Section 368(b) of the Code) in which the
Company is to be treated as merging directly with and into the Sister
Subsidiary, with the Shares converted in such merger into the right to
receive the consideration provided for hereunder.   (e) If the Merger and
the Subsequent Merger are consummated, each of the parties hereto shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, treat the Merger and Subsequent Merger for all
Tax purposes consistent with Section 1.4(d). If the Merger is consummated but
the Subsequent Merger is not consummated, each of the parties hereto shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, treat the Merger (as to those holders of
Shares generally subject to U.S. federal income tax) as a taxable acquisition
of the Shares by Parent in exchange for the consideration provided for
hereunder.   ARTICLE II   Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws  of
the Surviving Corporation   2.1. The Certificate of Incorporation. The
certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation (the "Charter"), until duly amended as provided therein or by
applicable law; provided, however, that the Charter shall include provisions
substantially identical to Section 8 of Article TENTH of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company; provided, further, that in no
event shall such provisions be amended after the Effective Time, in a manner
adverse to the rights of beneficiaries of such provisions prior to the
Effective Time, prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time.  
2.2. The By-Laws. The by-laws of the Company in effect at the Effective Time
shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (the "By-Laws"),
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable law.  
ARTICLE III   Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation   3.1.
Directors. The directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their successors     -3-    have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Charter and the By-Laws.   3.2. Officers. The officers of the
Company at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the By-Laws.  
ARTICLE IV   Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; Exchange of
Certificates   4.1. Merger Consideration. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, the Merger Sub or any holder of
shares of capital stock of the Company:   (i) Each share of the common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"),
together with the associated Right (each share of Company Common Stock
together with the associated Right, a "Share" or, collectively, the "Shares")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares the holders of which shall have perfected and not withdrawn or lost
their appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
("Dissenters\' Shares") and Shares owned directly or indirectly by
the Company or any of its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries or
owned directly or indirectly by Parent or any of its direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries (and in each case not held on behalf of third
parties), such Shares together with Dissenters\' Shares, "Excluded Shares")
will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of each holder
thereof, but subject to the election and allocation procedures of Sections
4.1(b) and (c), the other provisions of this Section 4.1 and possible
adjustment as set forth in Section 4.5, either:   (A) that number of common
shares of Parent ("Parent Common Stock")  rounded to four decimal places
equal to (I) 1.05 plus (II) the quotient  of (x) 14.40 divided by (y) the
average of the daily high and low sales  prices per share (the "Measurement
Price") of Parent Common Stock on the  NYSE Composite Tape, as reported in
The Wall Street Journal (Northeast  edition) or, if not reported therein, in
another authoritative source  mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company,
on the last trading day  immediately preceding the Closing Date (the sum of
(I) and (II), the "Per  Share Stock Consideration"), or   (B) an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to (I) $14.40 plus  (II) the product of (x)
1.05 multiplied by (y) the Measurement Price (the  sum of (I) and (II), the
"Per Share Cash Consideration" and, together  with the "Per Share Stock
Consideration," the "Consideration").   (ii) Each Share that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, is owned directly or indirectly by the Company,
Parent or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly    
-4-   owned Subsidiaries (and in each case not held on behalf of third
parties), will be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no
exchange or payment will be made therefor.   (iii) At the Effective Time
and concurrently with the issuance of common stock described in Section 4.8,
all the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one newly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable share of fixed
value preferred stock of the Surviving Corporation with a redemption amount
and fair market value of $100.   (b) Subject to the allocation procedures
set forth in Section 4.1(c), each record holder of Shares will be entitled
(i) to elect to receive shares of Parent Common Stock for all of the Shares
("Stock Election Shares") held by such record holder, (ii) to elect to
receive cash for all of the Shares ("Cash Election Shares") held by such
record holder or (iii) to indicate that such holder makes no such election
for all of the Shares ("No-Election Shares") held by such record holder,
provided, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the aggregate number of Shares to be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration in the Merger (the "Stock Number") will equal
as nearly as practicable the product of (x) the Adjustment Ratio multiplied
by (y) the total number of Shares outstanding (excluding Excluded Shares that
are not Dissenters\' Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time. As used
in this Agreement, the term "Adjustment Ratio" means the quotient rounded to
four decimal places of (I) the product rounded to four decimal places of (A)
1.05 multiplied by (B) the Measurement Price multiplied by (C) the
total number of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding Excluded Shares that are not Dissenters\' Shares) (the product of
(A), (B) and (C), the "Aggregate Stock Value"), divided by (II) the sum of
(A) the product rounded to one decimal place of 14.40 multiplied by the total
number of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding Excluded Shares that are not Dissenters\' Shares) and (B) the
Aggregate Stock Value. All such elections (each, an "Election") shall be made
on a form designed for that purpose by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
the Company (an "Election Form"). Any Shares for which the record holder has
not, as of the Election Deadline, properly submitted to the Exchange Agent a
properly completed Election Form (excluding any Dissenters\' Shares) will be
deemed No-Election Shares. All Dissenters\' Shares will be deemed Cash
Election Shares. A record holder acting in different capacities or acting on
behalf of other persons in any way will be entitled to submit an Election
Form for each capacity in which such record holder so acts with respect to
each person for which it so acts. The exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent")
will be a bank or trust company in the United States or Canada selected by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company.   (c) The allocation among
the holders of Shares of rights to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration
or the Per Share Cash Consideration in the Merger will be made as
follows:   (i) Number of Stock Elections Less Than Stock Number. If the
aggregate number of Stock Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms
received as of the Election Deadline) is less than the Stock Number, then  
(A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time,  converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,     -5-   
(B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the No-Election Shares,  pro
rata to the holders of No-Election Shares in accordance with their 
respective numbers of No-Election Shares, a sufficient number of  No-Election
Shares so that the sum of such number and the number of Stock  Election
Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Number, and each  such
allocated No-Election Share (each, a "Stock-Selected No-Election  Share")
will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to  receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration, provided that if the sum of all  No-Election
Shares and Stock Election Shares is equal to or less than the  Stock Number,
all No-Election Shares will be Stock-Selected No-Election  Shares,   (C) if
the sum of Stock Election Shares and No-Election Shares is less  than the
Stock Number, the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Cash  Election
Shares, pro rata to the holders of Cash Election Shares in  accordance with
their respective numbers of Cash Election Shares, a  sufficient number of
Cash Election Shares so that the sum of such number,  the number of all Stock
Election Shares and the number of all No-Election  Shares equals as closely
as practicable the Stock Number, and each such  allocated Cash Election Share
(each, a "Converted Cash Election Share")  will be, as of the Effective Time,
converted into the right to receive the  Per Share Stock Consideration,
and   (D) each No-Election Share and Cash Election Share that is not a 
Stock-Selected No-Election Share or a Converted Cash Election Share (as the 
case may be) will be, as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to 
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration; or   (ii) Number of Stock
Elections Greater Than Stock Number. If the aggregate number of Stock
Election Shares (on the basis of Election Forms received by the Election
Deadline) is greater than the Stock Number, then   (A) each Cash Election
Share and No-Election Share will be, as of the  Effective Time, converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash  Consideration,   (B) the
Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Stock Election  Shares, pro rata
to the holders of Stock Election Shares in accordance with  their respective
numbers of Stock Election Shares, a sufficient number of  Stock Election
Shares ("Converted Stock Election Shares") so that the  difference of (x) the
number of Stock Election Shares less (y) the number  of the Converted Stock
Election Shares equals as closely as practicable the  Stock Number, and each
Converted Stock Election Share will be, as of the  Effective Time, converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash  Consideration, and   (C) each
Stock Election Share that is not a Converted Stock Election  Share will be,
as of the Effective Time, converted into the right to  receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.   4.2. Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers. At the
Effective Time, holders of Shares will cease to be, and will have no rights
as, stockholders of the Company, other than     -6-   the right to
receive (a) any dividend or other distribution with respect to such Shares
with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time, (b)
the Consideration provided under this Article IV and (c) any cash in lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock. After the Effective Time, there
will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation of Shares.   4.3. Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement, no fractional share of Parent Common
Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership
thereof, will be issued in the Merger; instead, Parent will pay to each
holder of Shares who otherwise would be entitled to a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates (as
defined in Section 4.4(a)) delivered to the Exchange Agent or held by such
holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such
fraction by the Measurement Price.   4.4. Exchange Procedures. (a) At the
time of mailing of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to holders of record of
Shares entitled to vote at the Stockholders Meeting, Parent will mail, or
cause the Exchange Agent to mail, therewith an Election Form and a letter of
transmittal to each such holder. To be effective, an Election Form must be
properly completed, signed and actually received by the Exchange Agent not
later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day that is three
trading days prior to the Closing Date (which date shall be publicly
announced by Parent as soon as practicable prior to such date) (the "Election
Deadline") and accompanied by the certificates representing all the Shares
("Old Certificates") as to which such Election Form is being made, duly
endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books
of the Company (or accompanied by an appropriate guarantee of delivery by an
eligible organization) in the case of shares that are not held in book
entry form. For shares that are held in book entry form, Parent shall
establish procedures for the delivery of such shares, which procedures shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent shall have discretion, which
it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine
whether Election Forms have been properly completed, signed and timely
submitted or to disregard defects in Election Forms. Any such determination
of Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be conclusive and binding. Neither
Parent nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any
person of any defect in an Election Form submitted to the Exchange Agent. The
Exchange Agent shall also make all computations contemplated by Section 4.1
hereof, and, after consultation with Parent and the Company, all such
computations will be conclusive and binding on the former holders of Shares
absent manifest error. Any Shares for which the record holder has not, as of
the Election Deadline, properly submitted to the Exchange Agent a properly
completed Election Form will be deemed No-Election Shares. Any Election Form
may be revoked, by the stockholder who submitted such Election Form to the
Exchange Agent, only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior
to the Election Deadline. In addition, all Election Forms shall automatically
be revoked if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Parent and the
Company that the Merger has been abandoned. The Exchange Agent may, with the
mutual agreement of Parent and the Company, make such rules as are consistent
with this Section 4.4 for the implementation of the Elections provided for
herein as shall be necessary or desirable to effect fully such Elections.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will enter into
an exchange agent and nominee agreement with the Exchange Agent, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company, setting forth the procedures to be
used in accomplishing the deliveries and other actions contemplated by this
Section 4.4, the provisions of which     -7-   agreement may vary the
provisions of such Sections in any respect not material and adverse to the
stockholders of the Company.   (b) At or promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock ("New Certificates")
and an amount of cash (such New Certificates and cash, together with any
dividends or distributions with a record date occurring after the Effective
Date with respect thereto (without any interest on any such cash, dividends
or distributions) and any cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund")
sufficient to deliver to the holders of Shares the aggregate Consideration to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 4.1, together with all
cash and other property to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to
Sections 4.2 and 4.3 in respect of dividends and distributions or cash in
lieu of fractional share interests. At the time of such deposit, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation will irrevocably instruct the Exchange Agent to
deliver such Consideration to such holders after the Effective Time in
accordance with the procedures of the Exchange Agent referred to in Section
4.4(a).   (c) The Surviving Corporation will cause the New Certificates
into which Shares are converted into the right to receive at the Effective
Time and/or any cash in respect of any Per Share Cash Consideration, cash in
lieu of fractional share interests or dividends or distributions which such
person is entitled to receive to be delivered to such stockholder upon
delivery (if not previously delivered) to the Exchange Agent of Old
Certificates representing such Shares owned by such stockholder (or, if any
of such Old Certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed, the procedures of
Section 4.4(g) are followed). No interest will be paid on any Consideration,
or any cash in respect of fractional share interests or dividends or
distributions, that any such person is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article IV upon such delivery to the Exchange Agent of Old Certificates.  
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto will be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount delivered
in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.   (e) No dividends or other distributions on shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date occurring after the Effective Time
will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate representing
Shares converted in the Merger into the right to receive such shares of
Parent Common Stock until the holder thereof is entitled to receive New
Certificates in exchange therefor in accordance with this Article IV, and no
such Shares will be eligible to be voted at any meeting of holders of shares
of Parent Common Stock until the holder of the related Old Certificates is
entitled to receive New Certificates in accordance with this Article IV.
After becoming so entitled in accordance with this Article IV, the record
holder will be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock such holder had the right to receive
upon surrender of such Old Certificates.  (f) Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Old Certificates for six months
after the Effective Time will be returned to or to the direction of Parent.
Any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with
this     -8-   Article IV thereafter shall look only to Parent for
payment of their claim for Per Share Stock Consideration, Per Share Cash
Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each
Share represented by such Old Certificates such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest
thereon.   (g) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
(as defined below) claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the shares of
Parent Common Stock and any cash payable and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions in respect thereof pursuant to this Article IV upon due
surrender of and deliverable in respect of the Shares represented by such Old
Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.   For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Person" or "person" shall mean any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(d)) or other
entity of any kind or nature.   (h) Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Old Certificates surrendered for exchange by any
"affiliate" (as determined pursuant to Section 6.8) of the Company shall not
be exchanged until Parent has received a written agreement from such Person
as provided in Section 6.8 hereof.   4.5. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution.
In the event that the Company changes the number of Shares or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares, or Parent changes
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock, issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse split), dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, combination,
issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share
Cash Consideration and/or the Per Share Stock Consideration will be
adjusted appropriately to provide to the holders of Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such reclassification,
split, dividend, distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision,
combination, tender or exchange or similar transaction.   4.6. Dissenting
Stockholders. Dissenters\' Shares will be paid for by or at the direction of
Parent in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any written demands for fair value received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for fair
value for Dissenters\' Shares or offer to settle, or settle, or negotiate in
respect of any such demands.     -9-    4.7. Right to Withhold Taxes;
Real Estate Transfer Taxes. (a) Parent shall be entitled to deduct or
withhold any Taxes required to be deducted or withheld from the Per Share
Cash Consideration under Law. Any such amount deducted or withheld shall be
treated as if paid to the stockholder.   (b) Parent shall pay or cause to be
paid all state or local real property transfer, gains or similar Taxes, if
any (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes"), attributable to the transfer of the
beneficial ownership of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' real
properties, any penalties or interest with respect thereto, payable in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and/or the Subsequent Merger.
The Company shall cooperate with Parent in the filing of any returns with
respect to the Transfer Taxes, including supplying in a timely manner a
complete list of all real property interests held by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any information with respect to such properties that is
reasonably necessary to complete such returns. The portion of
the consideration allocable to the real properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall be determined by Parent in its reasonable discretion.
The shareholders of the Company shall be deemed to have agreed to be bound by
the allocation established pursuant to this Section 4.7(b) in the preparation
of any return with respect to Transfer Taxes.   4.8. Subscription for
Surviving Corporation Common Stock. At the Effective Time, in consideration
for the issuance by Parent of Parent Common Stock and the payment, if any, by
Parent of cash to the holders of Shares in accordance with Article IV, the
Surviving Corporation shall issue to Parent one hundred (100) shares of newly
issued, fully-paid and non-assessable common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE V   Representations and
Warranties   5.1. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as
set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure
schedule delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering into this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:   (a) Organization, Good
Standing and Qualification. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own and operate its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its assets
or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority when taken together with all other such
failures, is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below). The Company has made available to Parent a complete and
correct copy of the certificates of incorporation and by-laws or equivalent
organizational documents ("Organizational Documents") of the Company and its
"Significant Subsidiaries" (as defined in     -10-   Rule 1.02(w) of
Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act")), each as amended to date. The Organizational
Documents so made available are in full force and effect. Section 5.1(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list of each
jurisdiction where the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (other than any
Subsidiaries that have no operations and have no employees) is organized
and qualified to do business.   As used in this Agreement, the term (i)
"Subsidiary" means, with respect to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, any entity, whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which at
least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their
terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or
other persons performing similar functions is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by such party or by one or more of its respective Subsidiaries or
by such party and any one or more of its respective Subsidiaries and (ii)
"Company Material Adverse Effect" means an effect or change that,
individually or in the aggregate with other such effects or changes, is both
material and adverse with respect to the financial condition, business,
operations, results of operations, properties, assets, or liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that (i) to
the extent any effect or change is caused by or results from conditions
affecting the United States economy generally, it shall not be taken into
account in determining whether there has been (or whether there is reasonably
likely to be) a "Company Material Adverse Effect," and (ii) to the extent any
effect or change is caused by or results from conditions generally affecting
the industries (including the form and label and commercial print industries)
in which the Company conducts its business, it shall not be taken into
account in determining whether there has been (or whether there is reasonably
likely to be) a "Company Material Adverse Effect" and (iii) to the extent any
effect or change is caused by or results from the announcement or pendency of
this Agreement, it shall not be taken into account in determining whether
there has been (or whether there is reasonably likely to be) a
"Company Material Adverse Effect."   (b) Capital Structure. The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common
Stock and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $50.00 per share
("Preferred Shares"). As of the close of business on January 10, 2003
42,065,499 shares of Company Common Stock were outstanding, no Preferred
Shares were issued or outstanding and 3,698,022 shares of Company Common
Stock were held in the treasury or by Subsidiaries of the Company. All of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company has no shares
reserved for issuance, except that, as of January 12, 2003, (x) there were
(i) 3,824,436 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant
to outstanding options granted under the Company\'s 2001 Stock Incentive
Plan, 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and 1989 Stock Option Plan and 1,417,593
shares reserved for issuance pursuant to future grants or options under such
plans and the Company\'s Stock Deferral Plan, (ii) 1,405,859 shares
of Company Common Stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to the
Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (iii) 62,089 shares of Company
Common Stock reserved for future issuance pursuant to the Company\'s Director
Retainer Fee Plan and (iv) shares of Company Common Stock to be delivered in
respect of dividends on shares of Company Common Stock deferred pursuant to
the Company\'s Amended and Restated Executive Incentive Plan, under which
165,425.2 shares of Company Common Stock were deferred under such plan as of
January 15, 2003 (the "Stock Plans"), and (y) there were 3,437,088 Preferred
Shares reserved for issuance     -11-   pursuant to the rights (the
"Rights") under the Stockholder Rights Agreement, dated as of March 14, 2000,
between the Company and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Rights Agent (the
"Rights Agreement"). The Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and
complete list of each outstanding option to purchase Shares under the Stock
Plans other than pursuant to the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(each a "Company Option"), including the holder, date of grant, exercise
price and number of Shares subject thereto. Each of the outstanding shares of
capital stock or other securities of each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
any lien, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance. There are no
preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights,
stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities
or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.
The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders
of the Company on any matter ("Voting Debt"). The Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any voting interest in any Person that may require a
filing by Parent under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976, as amended (the "HSR Act").   (c) Corporate Authority; Approval and
Fairness. (i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and
has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate, subject only
to approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Requisite Vote"), the Merger.
This Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms.   (ii) The Board of
Directors of the Company (A) has unanimously approved this Agreement and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) has received
the opinion of its financial advisor, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, Inc.,
to the effect that the Consideration is fair from a financial point of view
to holders of Shares (other than Parent and its "Affiliates" (as defined in
Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act)), a copy of which opinion has
been delivered to Parent. It is agreed and understood that such opinion is
for the benefit of the Company\'s Board of Directors and may not be relied on
by Parent or Merger Sub.   (d) Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain
Contracts. (i) Other than the filings, notices and/or approvals (A) pursuant
to Section 1.3, (B) under the HSR Act, (C) under the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), (D) to comply with
state securities or "blue-sky" laws, (E) required to be made with the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") and (F) required and customary filings
pursuant to any state environmental transfer statutes including, without
limitation, the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act N.J.S.A. 13:1K-6 et
seq. and the Connecticut Transfer Act, C.G.S. 22a-134a et seq., no notices,
reports or other filings are required to be made by the Company with, nor
are     -12-   any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by the Company from, any governmental
or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body or other governmental
entity ("Governmental Entity"), in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the
failure to make or obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (ii) The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company do not,
and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the Organizational Documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, or a
default under, the acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a lien,
pledge, security interest or other encumbrance on the assets of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or both)
pursuant to, any agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage,
indenture, arrangement or other obligation ("Contracts") binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Law (as defined in Section 5.1(i))
or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the rights or
obligations of any party under any of the Contracts, except, in the case of
clause (B) or (C) above, for any breach, violation, default, acceleration,
creation or change that, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay
or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.1(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of (i) any of the
top fifty customer Contracts of the Company based upon five months revenues
prior to January 1, 2002 and (ii) any real property leases of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for more than 20,000 square feet of space, in each case,
pursuant to which consents or waivers are or may be required prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether or
not subject to the exception set forth with respect to clauses (B) and (C)
above).   (e) Company Reports; Financial Statements. The Company has
delivered to the Parent each registration statement, report, proxy statement
or information statement prepared by it since July 31, 2002 (the "Audit
Date"), including the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended July 31, 2002 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended
October 31, 2002 (including exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto)
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") (collectively,
including any other reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof
and as amended, the "Company Reports"). As of their respective dates (or, if
amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment), the
Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with the SEC
subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company     -13-   Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its subsidiaries as of its date and each of the
consolidated statements of income and of changes in financial position
included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including
any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the
results of operations, retained earnings and changes in financial position,
as the case may be, of the Company and its subsidiaries for the periods set
forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and
normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or
effect), in each case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") consistently applied during the periods involved, except
as may be noted therein. The Company has no cash obligations or liabilities
with respect to any restructuring plan, including with respect to the
Company\'s 2000 and 2002 restructuring plans.   (f) Absence of Certain
Changes. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to the date
hereof, since the Audit Date the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any material
transaction other than according to, the ordinary and usual course of such
businesses and there has not been (i) any change in the financial condition,
business, operations, results of operations, properties, assets or
liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any development
or combination of developments of which management of the Company has
knowledge that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any material damage,
destruction or other casualty loss with respect to any material asset or
property owned, leased or otherwise used by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance; (iii) any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution in cash, stock
or property in respect of the capital stock of the Company, except for
dividends or other distributions on its capital stock publicly announced
prior to the date hereof and except as expressly permitted hereby; or (iv)
any change by the Company in accounting principles or any material accounting
practices or methods. Since the Audit Date, except as provided for herein or
as disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof, there has
not been any increase in the compensation payable or that could become
payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to officers or key
employees or any amendment of any of the Compensation and Benefit Plans other
than increases or amendments in the ordinary course.   (g) Litigation and
Liabilities. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, there are no (i) civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Affiliates or (ii) obligations or liabilities, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be
disclosed, including those relating to Environmental Law (as defined in
Section 5.1(k)) or any other facts or circumstances of which the Company has
knowledge that could result in any claims against, or obligations or
liabilities of, the Company or any of its Affiliates, except for those that
are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially burden or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   (h) Employee Benefits. (i) A copy of each written, and
a description of each unwritten, bonus, deferred compensation, pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock
bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option, employment,
termination, severance, compensation, medical, health or other plan,
agreement,     -14-   policy or arrangement that covers employees,
directors, former employees or former directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Compensation and Benefit Plans") and any trust agreement
or insurance contract forming a part of such Compensation and Benefit Plan
has been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof. The Compensation
and Benefit Plans are listed in Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and any Compensation and Benefit Plan that is the subject of a
favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service National Office,
including any master or prototype plan, has been separately identified in
such Section 5.1(h)(i).   (ii) To the knowledge of the Company, except as
set forth in Section 5.1(h)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, all
Compensation and Benefit Plans that are subject to the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), other than "Multiemployer
Plans" (as within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA), (the "ERISA Plans")
are in material compliance with all applicable law, including the Code and
ERISA. Each ERISA Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") and that is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is the subject of a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") covering
all tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA"), is the subject of a request to the IRS
for such favorable determination letter submitted within the applicable
remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, or is entitled to
rely upon the favorable opinion letters described above, and the Company is
not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable opinion or determination letter. Except as set forth in
Section 5.1(h)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each "employee pension
benefit plan" set forth in Section 5.1(h)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule which was merged into an ERISA Plan and that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is the subject of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS covering all tax law changes between 1994
and 2000 (collectively, "GUST"), was entitled to rely upon a favorable GUST
opinion letter as described above or was merged into an ERISA Plan prior to
the expiration of the GUST remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of
the Code. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
material litigation relating to the ERISA Plans. To the knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period
of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would subject the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has filed, or is considering filing, an application under
the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or the Department of
Labor\'s (the "DOL") Voluntary Fiduciary Correction program with respect to
any ERISA Plan.   (iii) As of the date hereof, no liability under Subtitle C
or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the
Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated
"single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA,
currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan
of any entity which is considered a single employer together with the Company
pursuant to Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA
Affiliate"). The Company and its Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not
expect to incur any material withdrawal liability with respect to a
Multiemployer Plan (regardless of whether based on contributions of an
ERISA     -15-   Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within
the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting
requirement has not been waived or extended, other than pursuant to PBGC Reg.
Section 4043.66, has been required to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any
ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will
be required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (iv) All contributions or premiums required to be made
under the terms of any Compensation and Benefit Plan or by law as of the date
hereof have been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company

faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any extension of time

failures, is not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below). Parent has made available to the Company a complete and
correct copy of Parent\'s and its Significant Subsidiaries\' Organizational

other such effects or changes, is both material and adverse with respect to

properties, assets or liabilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a

caused by or results from conditions affecting the United States economy
generally, it shall not be taken into account in determining whether there
has been (or whether there is reasonably likely to be) a "Parent Material
Adverse Effect," and (ii) to the extent any effect or change is caused by or
results from conditions generally affecting the industries (including the
form and label and commercial print industries) in which Parent conducts its
business, it shall not be taken into account in determining whether there has
been (or whether there is reasonably likely to be) a "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" and (iii) to the extent any effect or change is caused by or results
from the announcement or pendency of this Agreement, it shall not be taken
into account in determining whether there has been (or whether there is

obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving
any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company
or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, and no securities or
obligation evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.

of Parent on any matter ("Parent Voting Debt").   (d) Corporate Authority.
(i) Except as may be required by The Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX"), no vote

obtained by Parent or Merger Sub from, any Governmental Entity, in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub
and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or
obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (ii) The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the Organizational Documents or,
if applicable, the resolutions of     -23-   stockholders, of Parent
and Merger Sub, (B) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the
acceleration of any obligations or the creation of a lien, pledge, security
interest or other encumbrance on the assets of Parent or any of its

Contracts binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Law
or governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations
of any party under any of the Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or
(C) above, for breach, violation, default, acceleration, creation or change

impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.2(e) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of Contracts of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (other than Contracts terminable upon sixty or fewer days\'

with the SEC (collectively, including any such reports filed subsequent to

Parent Reports did not, and any Parent Reports filed with the SEC subsequent

position included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly
present, the results of operations, retained earnings and changes in

amount or effect), in each case in accordance with Canadian generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the
periods involved, except as may be noted therein.   (g) Absence of Certain

hereof, since the Parent Audit Date Parent and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in any
material transaction other than according to, the ordinary and usual course
of such businesses and there has not been (i) any change in the financial
condition, business, operations, results of operations, properties, assets or
liabilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries or any development or combination
of developments of which management of Parent has knowledge

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or    
-24-   prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any
material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to any
material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether or not covered by insurance; (iii) any

in cash, stock or property in respect of the capital stock of Parent, except

course.   (h) Litigation and Liabilities. Except as disclosed in the

criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, investigations
or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent or any of its Affiliates or (ii) obligations or liabilities, whether
or not accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether or not required to be
disclosed, including those relating to matters involving any Environmental
Law, or any other facts or circumstances of which the Parent has knowledge
that could result in any claims against, or obligations or liabilities of,
Parent or any of its Affiliates, except for those that are not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or materially burden or materially impair the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (i) Employee Benefits. (i) A copy of each written, and a
description of each unwritten, bonus, deferred compensation, pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock
bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option, employment,
termination, severance, compensation, medical, health or other plan,
agreement, policy or arrangement that covers employees, directors, former
employees or former directors of Parent and its Subsidiaries (the "Parent
Compensation and Benefit Plans") and any trust agreement or insurance
contract forming a part of such Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan has been
made available to the Company prior to the date hereof. The Parent
Compensation and Benefit Plans are listed in Section 5.2(i)(i) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule and any Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan that is the
subject of a favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue
Service National Office, including any master or prototype plan, has been
separately identified in such Section 5.2(i)(i).   (ii) To the knowledge of
Parent, except as set forth in Section 5.2(i)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, all Compensation and Benefit Plans that are subject to ERISA, other
than Multiemployer Plans, (the "Parent ERISA Plans") are in material
compliance with all applicable law, including the Code and ERISA. Each Parent
ERISA Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Parent Pension Plan") and that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is the subject of a favorable
determination letter from the IRS covering all tax law changes prior to the
EGTRRA, is the subject of a request to the IRS for such
favorable determination letter submitted within the applicable remedial
amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, or is entitled to rely
upon the favorable opinion letters described above and Parent is not aware of
any circumstances     -25-   likely to result in revocation of any such
favorable opinion or determination letter. There is no pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened material litigation relating to the Parent
ERISA Plans. To the knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Parent ERISA
Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the
date hereof, would subject Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to a material
tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed, or is
considering filing, an application under the IRS Employee Plans Compliance
Resolution System or the DOL\'s Voluntary Fiduciary Correction program with
respect to any Parent ERISA Plan.   (iii) As of the date hereof, no
liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected
to be incurred by Parent or any Subsidiary with respect to any ongoing,
frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them, or the
single-employer plan of any entity which is considered an ERISA Affiliate of
Parent. Parent and its Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to
incur any material withdrawal liability with respect to a Multiemployer Plan
(regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate of
Parent). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section
4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived
or extended, other than pursuant to PBGC Reg. Section 4043.66, has been
required to be filed for any Parent Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate of
Parent within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will be
required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   (iv) All contributions and premiums required to be made
under the terms of any Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan as of the date
hereof have been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Parent
Reports prior to the date hereof. Neither any Parent Pension Plan nor any
"single-employer plan," as defined above, of an ERISA Affiliate of Parent has
an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the
meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA
Affiliate of Parent has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither Parent nor its
Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Parent
Pension Plan or to any "single-employer plan" of an ERISA Affiliate of Parent
pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.   (v) Under each Parent Pension
Plan which is a single-employer plan, as of the last day of the most recent
plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially determined present
value of all "benefit liabilities," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16)
of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained
in the Parent Pension Plan\'s most recent actuarial valuation), did not
exceed the then current value of the assets of such Parent Pension Plan, and
there has been no material change in the financial condition of such Parent
Pension Plan since the last day of the most recent plan year. The withdrawal
liability of Parent and its Subsidiaries under each Multiemployer Plan to
which Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or an ERISA Affiliate has contributed
during the preceding 12 months, determined as if a "complete withdrawal"
within the meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA, had occurred as of the date
hereof, does not exceed $5,000,000.     -26-    (vi) Neither Parent nor
its Subsidiaries have any material obligations for retiree health and life
benefits under any Parent ERISA Plan, except as set forth in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule. Each such plan contains provisions that allow Parent or
its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate such plan at any time.   (vii) There
has been no amendment to, announcement by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, any
Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan which would increase materially the
expense of maintaining such Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan above
the level of the expense incurred therefore for the most recent fiscal year.
Parent confirms that, as of the date hereof, Parent does not intend to make
any material change to the Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans. The
execution of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement, or
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not (u) entitle any employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries to
severance pay, (v) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any
payment of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Parent
Compensation and Benefit Plans, (w) result in any breach or violation of, or
default under, any of the Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans, (x) limit or
restrict the right of Parent to merge, amend or terminate any of the Parent
Compensation and Benefit Plans, (y) cause Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to record additional compensation expense on its income statement with
respect to any outstanding stock option or other equity-based award or (z)
result in payments under any of Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans that
are not deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code or
pursuant to the Income Tax Act (Canada) to the extent such payments were so
deductible prior to said events.   (viii) All Parent Compensation and
Benefit Plans covering current or former non-U.S. employees or former
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries ("Non-U.S. Parent Compensation and
Benefit Plans") are and have been registered, qualified, invested and
administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable local law
and the terms of such Non-U.S. Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans. Parent
and its Subsidiaries have complied with all material obligations under such
Non-U.S. Parent Compensation and Benefit Plans and there is no proceeding,
action, complaint, investigation or claim in respect of any Non-U.S. Parent
Compensation and Benefit Plan initiated by any regulatory authority or any
other person (other than routine inquiries and claims for benefits). Each
Non-U.S. Parent Compensation and Benefit Plan which is a funded plan is fully
funded as of the last actuarial valuation date on both a going concern and a
solvency basis pursuant to the actuarial assumptions and methodology utilized
in the most recent actuarial valuation therefore as filed with applicable
regulatory authorities. None of the Non-U.S. Parent Compensation and Benefit
Plan (other than pension plan) provide benefits to retired employees or to
the beneficiaries or dependants of retired employees.   (j) Compliance with
Laws; Permits. Except as set forth in the Parent Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, the businesses of each of Parent and its Subsidiaries have not
been, and are not being, conducted in violation in any material respect of
any Laws, except for any violation that is not material. Except as set forth
in the Parent Reports filed prior to the date hereof and except as to matters
that individually and in the aggregate are immaterial, no investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of
its     -27-   Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct
the same. To the knowledge of Parent, no material change is required in
Parent\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' processes, properties or procedures in
connection with any such Laws, and Parent has not received any notice or
communication of any material noncompliance with any such Laws that has not
been cured as of the date hereof. Parent and its Subsidiaries each has all
permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and other
governmental authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to conduct its
business in all material respects as presently conducted.   (k) Takeover
Statutes. No Takeover Statute or any anti-takeover provision in the Parent\'s
Organizational Documents is, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to
Parent, the Parent Common Stock, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (l) Environmental Matters. Except as
disclosed in the Parent Reports prior to the date hereof and except for
matters that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially burden or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement: (i) the Parent and its Subsidiaries have
complied at all times with all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) no
property currently owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including soils, groundwater, surface water, buildings or other structures)
is contaminated with any Hazardous Substance which could reasonably be
expected to require remediation pursuant to any Environmental Law; (iii)
no property formerly owned or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
was contaminated with any Hazardous Substance during or prior to such period
of ownership or operation which contamination could reasonably be expected
to require remediation pursuant to any Environmental Law; (iv) neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable for any Hazardous Substance disposal
or contamination on any third party property; (v) neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any notice, demand, letter, claim or request
for information alleging that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may be in
violation of or subject to liability under any Environmental Law; (vii)
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any order, decree,
injunction indemnity or other agreement with any Governmental Entity or third
party relating to liability under any Environmental Law or relating to
Hazardous Substances; (viii) there are no other circumstances or conditions
involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected
to result in any claim, liability, investigation, cost or restriction on the
ownership, use, or transfer of any property pursuant to any Environmental
Law; and (ix) Parent has made available to the Company copies of all material
environmental reports, studies, assessments, sampling data and other
environmental documents in its possession relating to Parent or its
Subsidiaries or their respective current and former properties or
operations.   (m) Financing Commitment Letter; Ownership of Shares. (i)
Parent has delivered to the Company a complete and correct copy of the
commitment letter, dated the date hereof, pursuant to which the lenders have
committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
provide financing to Parent in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Financing Commitment").     -28-    (ii) Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries "Beneficially Owns" or is the "Beneficial
Owner" of (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement, as amended) any
Shares.   (n) Intellectual Property. (i) Parent and/or each of its
Subsidiaries owns, is licensed or otherwise possesses legally enforceable
rights to use all patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain
names, copyrights, and any applications therefor, technology, trade secrets,
know-how, computer software and tangible or intangible proprietary
information or materials that are used in the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and to the knowledge of Parent, all
patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names and copyrights
owned by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting.   (ii)
Except as disclosed in Parent Reports filed prior to the date hereof:   (A)
neither Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is, nor will Parent or  any of its
Subsidiaries be as a result of the execution and delivery of  this Agreement
or the performance of Parent\'s obligations hereunder, in  violation of any
material licenses, sublicenses or other agreements as to  which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which  Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is authorized to use any third-party  patents, trademarks,
service marks, domain names, copyrights, technology,  trade secrets, know-
how, computer software or tangible or intangible  proprietary information or
materials (collectively, "Parent Third-Party  Intellectual Property
Rights");   (B) no claims with respect to (I) the patents, registered and
material  unregistered trademarks and service marks, domain names, registered
and  material unregistered copyrights, trade names, and any applications 
therefor, technology, trade secrets, know-how, computer software or  tangible
or intangible proprietary information or materials owned by Parent  or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Parent Intellectual Property  Rights");
or (II) Parent Third-Party Intellectual Property Rights are  currently
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, are threatened by any  Person, except
for immaterial claims;   (C) to the knowledge of Parent, there are no valid
grounds for any bona  fide claims (I) to the effect that the manufacture,

secret or other  proprietary right of any Person; (II) against the use by

Parent or any  of its Subsidiaries; and   (D) to the knowledge of Parent,
there is no unauthorized use,  infringement or misappropriation or violation
of any of the Parent  Intellectual Property Rights by any   -29-   
third party, including any employee or former employee of Parent or any of 
its Subsidiaries.   (o) Taxes. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (i) have
prepared in good faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any
extension of time within which to file) all Tax Returns required to be filed
by any of them, except where failures to so prepare or file Tax Returns are
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; (ii) all such filed Tax Returns are complete and
accurate in all respects, except where failure to be complete and accurate
are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, (iii) have duly and timely paid all Taxes (as
defined below) that are required to be paid or that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries are obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee,
creditor or third party, except with respect to matters contested in good
faith in appropriate proceedings and reserved for in accordance with Canadian
GAAP and except where failures to so pay are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; and
(iv) have not waived any statute of limitations with respect to any material
Taxes or, to the extent related to such Taxes, agreed to any extension of
time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, in each case to the
extent such waiver or agreement is currently in effect. The Tax
Returns referred to in clause (i) of the previous sentence, to the extent
related to income, sales or use Taxes, have been examined by the IRS or the
appropriate state, local or foreign taxing authority or the period for
assessment of the Taxes in respect of which such Tax Returns were required to
be filed has expired. As of December 31, 2001, there were no material audits,
examinations, investigations or other proceedings pending or threatened in
writing in respect of Taxes or Tax matters. Parent has made available to the
Company true and correct copies of the United States federal, state, local
and foreign income Tax Returns filed by Parent and its Subsidiaries for
taxable years ended after December 31, 1995 and before the date hereof.
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have complied with all United States
federal information reporting requirements and has retained all necessary
information in its files to permit continued compliance with informational
reporting requirements, except where failures to so comply or retain are not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. There are no material liens on any of the assets of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, except for liens relating to current taxes not yet
due and payable. No closing or similar agreements have been entered into by
any taxing authority with the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except
closing and similar agreements that are not reasonably expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries. Neither
Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any predecessor to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has made with respect to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, or any
predecessor of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries any consent under Section
341 of the Code. Neither Moore Holdings USA, Inc. nor any of its Subsidiaries
is or has been a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning of Section
1504(a) of the Code) filing consolidated United States federal income Tax
Returns (other than such a group the common parent of which is or was Moore
Holdings USA, Inc.). Neither Parent nor any of the Subsidiaries of Parent has
been a party to any distribution during the last 3 years in which the parties
to such distribution treated the distribution as one to which Section 355 of
the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law)
applied.   (p) Brokers and Finders. Neither Parent nor any of its
officers, directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any brokerage fees,     -30-   commissions
or finders, fees in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except that Parent has employed Morgan
Stanley and Co. Incorporated as its financial advisor, the arrangements with
which have been disclosed to the Company prior to the date hereof.   (q)
Insurance. Parent and its Subsidiaries maintain fire and casualty, general
liability, business interruption, product liability, and sprinkler and water
damage and other insurance policies, as applicable, that are consistent with
that of other companies of substantially similar size and scope of operations
in the same or substantially similar businesses.   ARTICLE VI

necessary to consummate the Merger or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (II) significantly increase the risk of any

neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors
of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\' employees, agents
and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly,
initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise knowingly facilitate any inquiries
or the making by any third party of any proposal or offer with respect to a
purchase, merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar
transaction involving any material portion of the consolidated assets of the
Company or fifteen (15%) or more of any equity securities of the Company (any
such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an "Acquisition
Proposal"). The Company further agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives (including
any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential     -33-   information or data
to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained
in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from
(A) complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal; (B) at any time prior, but not after,
the Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 6.4) is convened,
providing information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of
Directors receives from the Person so requesting such information an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7); (C)
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; or (D) recommending such
an Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of the Company, if and only to
the extent that, (i) in each such case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D)
above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable law and
(ii) in the case referred to in clause (C) or (D) above, the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal and
could, in the case of (C), and would, in the case of (D), if consummated,
result in a transaction more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders from a
financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(any such more favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to in this
Agreement as a "Superior Proposal"). The Company agrees that it will
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in
the first sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section
6.2 and in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7). The
Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly if any such inquiries,
proposals or offers are received by, any such information is requested from,
or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, any of its representatives indicating, in connection with
such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of
any proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a
current basis, on the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and
the status of any such discussions or negotiations. The Company also agrees
that it will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
it or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any
of its Subsidiaries.   6.3. Information Supplied. The Company and Parent
each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to
be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger (including the proxy statement and
prospectus (the "Prospectus/ Proxy Statement") constituting a part thereof)
(the "S-4 Registration Statement") will, at the time the S-4 Registration
Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or     -34-   necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and (ii) the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Company and Parent will cause the Form S-4 to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder.   6.4. Stockholders Meeting. The
Company will take, in accordance with applicable law and its Organizational
Documents, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares
(the "Stockholders Meeting") as promptly as practicable after the S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective to consider and vote upon the
approval of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company may postpone
or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting to a date promptly after Parent has
entered into definitive financing agreements or provided other evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Company that Parent has the ability to borrow
at the Closing funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share
Cash Consideration, transaction expenses, refinance indebtedness of Parent,
the Company and their respective Subsidiaries and otherwise consummate
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the Commitment
Letter (entering into such definitive financing agreements or providing such
evidence being the "Financing Event"). Subject to fiduciary obligations under
applicable law, the Company\'s Board of Directors shall recommend and not
withdraw such approval and shall take all lawful action to solicit such
approval.   6.5. Filings; Other Actions; Notification. (a) Parent and the
Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement, and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the S-4
Registration Statement as promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company
each shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the S-4 Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, including procuring any opinions necessary for
such declaration and promptly thereafter mail the Prospectus/Proxy Statement
to the stockholders of the Company. Parent shall also use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the effective date of the S-4
Registration Statement any necessary state securities law or "blue sky"
permits and approvals required in connection with the Merger and
to consummate the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will
pay all expenses incident thereto.   (b) The Company and Parent each shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered a letter of its
independent auditors, dated (i) the date on which the S-4 Registration
Statement shall become effective and (ii) the Closing Date, and addressed to
the other party and its directors, in form and substance customary for
"comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the S-4 Registration Statement,
except that the "comfort" letter delivered by the independent auditors of the
Company need only cover the fiscal year ended July 31, 2002 and any periods
reviewed by such independent auditors subsequent to such period.   (c) The
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to take
or cause     -35-   to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement
and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger, the
financing for the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly
as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and
other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents,
registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable
to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order
to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.5 shall
require, or be construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell
or hold separate and agree to sell, before or after the Effective Time, any
assets, businesses, or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, or
agreement to sell, by the Company of any of its assets or businesses) or to
agree to any material changes or restriction in the operations of any such
assets or businesses. Subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on,
all the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.   (d) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (e) The Company and Parent each shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary rulings or orders of
Canadian securities regulatory authorities to exempt the distribution by
Parent of the Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement from the
registration and prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities
law and ensure that the first trade in the shares of Parent Common Stock so
distributed shall not be considered to be a distribution, provided that the
conditions set out in subsection (3) or (4) of section 2.6 of the
Multilateral Instrument 45-102 and equivalent provisions in the province of
Quebec are satisfied.   (f) The Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notice or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case
may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent each shall give prompt
notice to the other of any change that is reasonably likely to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect,
respectively. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers
or any other representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other party in     -36-   advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.   (g) Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Section 6.5, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to satisfy the conditions contained in Section 7.2(e) of this
Agreement.   (h) The Company and Parent shall promptly make all
filings, notifications, applications, permit transfers and other submissions
relating to the Offer and Merger required or customary pursuant to any
Environmental Laws including without limitation those relating to the
ownership, operation or transfer of real property such as the New Jersey
Industrial Site Recovery Act N.J.S.A. 13:1K-6 et seq. and the Connecticut
Transfer Act, C.G.S. 22a-134a et seq. ("Environmental Submissions"). The
Company and the Parent shall provide each other with copies of all
Environmental Submissions at the time of filing and the parties shall
cooperate with each other in the preparation and execution of all
Environmental Submissions.   6.6. Taxation. None of Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation shall knowingly take or cause to be taken any
action, whether before or, if the Subsequent Merger is consummated, after the
Effective Time, that would disqualify the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.   6.7. Access. Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise
be required by applicable law, each of the Company and Parent shall (and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford the officers, employees,
counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives of the other
party ("Representatives") reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books,
contracts, records and personnel and, during such period, each of the Company
and Parent shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to the other all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by any party hereto and provided, further,
that nothing in this Section 6.7 shall require any party hereto to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of such party would result in (a) the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if such party shall have used commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or
(b) any violation of laws relating to the sharing of information between
competitors, it being understood that the parties will provide extracts, or
summaries, or aggregations or other information to the greatest extent
practicable in a manner that does not result in any such violation or
improper disclosure. The parties agree that requests for access to the
properties and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries by
environmental consultants and testing firms upon reasonable notice and during
normal business hours shall be reasonably requested. In connection with and
subject to the foregoing, the Company agrees to make available to Parent and
its Representatives, promptly after they are available, monthly summary
profit and loss statements for the Company consolidated and for each division
and a summary month end consolidated balance sheet for the Company. The
Company also agrees to give Representatives of Parent, upon reasonable notice
and accompanied by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Operating Officer
of the Company or another executive designated by one of them, an opportunity
to meet periodically with sales     -37-   and operations (including
plant comptrollers) management of the Company to discuss integration plans
and issues. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.7
shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, or such Person as may be designated by such party. All such
information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.   6.8. Affiliates. Prior to the date of the
Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of names and
addresses of those Persons who are, in the opinion of the Company, as of the
time of the Stockholders Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company within the
meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall provide to
Parent such information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for
purposes of reviewing such list. There shall be added to such list the names
and addresses of any other Person subsequently identified by either Parent or
the Company as a Person who may be deemed to be such an affiliate of the
Company; provided, however, that no such Person identified by Parent shall be
added to the list of affiliates of the Company if Parent shall receive from
the Company, on or before the date of the Stockholders Meeting, an opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such Person is
not such an affiliate. The Company shall exercise its commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the Closing
Date, from each affiliate of the Company identified in the foregoing list (as
the same may be supplemented as aforesaid), a letter dated as of the Closing
Date substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A (the "Affiliates
Letter"). Parent shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the
S-4 Registration Statement or any other registration statement under the
Securities Act for the purposes of resale of Parent Common Stock by such
affiliates received in the Merger and the certificates representing Parent
Common Stock received by such affiliates shall bear a customary legend
regarding applicable Securities Act restrictions and the provisions of this
Section 6.8.   6.9. Stock Exchange Listing and De-listing. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for issuance and listing on the TSX and
the NYSE subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.
The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Shares to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.   6.10. Publicity;
Employee Communications. (a) The initial press release shall be a joint press
release and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult with each
other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings
with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national
securities exchange) with respect thereto, except as may be required by law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
national securities exchange.   (b) Except to the extent such notice is not
practicable, at least two business days prior to making or issuing any formal
communication or correspondence to its or its Subsidiaries\' employees
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the effects
thereof, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of such proposed
communication or correspondence and give Parent the opportunity to comment on
such communication or     -38-   correspondence and shall not
unreasonably reject any comments Parent shall make. Parent has commented on
and approved the materials provided to it prior to the date hereof regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   6.11. Benefits, etc. (a)
Stock Options. Prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option,
whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled and only entitle the
holder thereof, as soon as reasonably practicable after surrender thereof, to
receive from the Company an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
total number of Shares subject to the Company Option and (y) the excess of
the Per Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such
Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld in respect of
such Company Option. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company
shall cooperate in taking all commercially reasonable efforts necessary or
advisable to effect the foregoing.   (b) Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The
Company shall terminate its Employee Stock Purchase Plan effective
immediately following the last day of the offering period ending after the
date of this Agreement, with the effect of such termination being that no
Offering, within the meaning of such plan, shall commence after the date of
this Agreement.   (c) Employee Benefits. (i) Parent agrees that, as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall arrange
for the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to participate in the
employee benefit plans of Parent, including but not limited to Parent
Compensation and Benefit Plans, on substantially the same terms and
conditions of similarly situated employees of Parent. In the interim, Parent
shall not reduce the aggregate level of benefits provided to the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries under the Compensation and Benefit Plans
(other than Stock Plans pursuant to which no new awards will be granted).
Parent shall cause its employee benefit plans (including but not limited to
vacation, severance and disability plans) to take into account for purposes
of eligibility, benefits (excluding accruals under a defined benefit plan)
and vesting thereunder service by employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent to the same extent that such
service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company. For purposes of
each Parent employee benefit plan providing medical, dental, prescription
drug, vision, life insurance or disability benefits to any employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, Parent shall cause its employee benefit plans to
(a) waive all pre-existing condition exclusions of its employee benefit plans
with respect to such employees and their dependents to the same extent such
exclusions were waived under a comparable plan of the Company and (b) take
into account any eligible expenses incurred by such employees and their
dependents for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employees and their covered
dependents under the applicable employee benefit plan of Parent. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all employee
benefit obligations to current and former employees under the Compensation
and Benefit Plans and, to the extent set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, all employee severance plans (or policies) in existence on the date
hereof and set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule and all employment or
severance agreements entered into by the Company or adopted by the Board of
Directors of the Company prior to the date hereof.   (ii) The Company agrees
that, prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company, the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof will (x) take any    
-39-   action or omit to take any action which would cause a "Material
Change" to occur under the terms of any applicable Compensation and Benefit
Plan or (y) deposit any cash, marketable securities or other property or
funds into the Company\'s Benefit Trust dated December 8, 1995, as thereafter
amended.   (iii) The Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or any
duly authorized committee thereof may implement a retention plan for the
benefit of those classes of key employees identified, including reasonably
numerous classes and the minimum numbers of participants in each such class,
by the Company to Parent which classes and allocation of benefit among
classes are approved in writing by Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) after the date hereof; provided, that the
implementation of such a retention plan shall not have an aggregate cost in
excess of $3,000,000, $1,500,000 of which shall be payable on the Closing
Date and $1,500,000 of which shall be payable on the date that is six months
after the Closing Date (or if earlier, upon termination, with respect to any
employee who is terminated by the Company after the Closing).   (iv) Prior
to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take such actions as are
necessary to cause the right of any nonemployee director to receive a
deferred Share pursuant to the Company\'s Director Retainer Fee Plan or any
employee to receive a deferred Share pursuant to the Company\'s
Executive Incentive Plan, as such plans have been or are to be amended in
accordance with this Agreement (the "Share Deferral Plans"), to be converted
as of the Effective Time into either a right to receive from Parent the Per
Share Cash Consideration or a right to receive from Parent the Per Share
Stock Consideration, as elected by such nonemployee director or employee in
the same manner as that set forth in Section 4.1 of this Agreement with
respect to an issued and outstanding Share held by such nonemployee director
or employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. The payment of cash or
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Section 6.11(c)(iv) shall be
made at the same time, and in the same manner, as provided under the terms of
the applicable Share Deferral Plan; provided, however, that a right to
receive a cash payment shall be credited with interest from the Effective
Time until such payment, compounded quarterly, at the rate equivalent to the
average Moody\'s Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield for the preceding calendar
quarter as determined from the Moody\'s Investor Service, Inc. (or any
successor thereto).   (d) Election to Parent\'s Board of Directors. (i)
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall offer three members of the Board of
Directors of the Company the opportunity to serve on Parent\'s Board of
Directors after the Effective Time.   (ii) Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall increase the size of its Board of Directors and cause
those individuals who have accepted Parent\'s offer referred to in clause (i)
above, to be appointed to Parent\'s Board of Directors and, subject to
fiduciary obligations under applicable law, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such individuals to be elected as directors of Parent
at the first annual meeting of stockholders of Parent with a proxy mailing
date after the Effective Time.   6.12. Expenses. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in
connection with the transactions contemplated in Article IV, and Parent shall
reimburse the Surviving Corporation for such charges and expenses.    
-40-   Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5(b), whether or not the
Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, except that
expenses incurred in connection with the filing fee for the S-4 Registration
Statement and printing and mailing the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4
Registration Statement shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company.  
6.13. Indemnification; Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance. (a) Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, and shall itself honor as if
it were the Surviving Corporation, in each case, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, for a period of not less than six years from the
Effective Time (or, in the case of matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time that have not been resolved prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, until such matters are finally resolved), all rights to
indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of a director, officer,
employee, agent or employee benefit plan fiduciary (an "Indemnified Party")
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation,
rights relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification rights to
which such persons are entitled because they are serving as a director,
officer, agent or employee of another entity at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries), as provided in the Organizational Documents of the
Company or any indemnification agreement, in each case, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, and relating to actions or events through the
Effective Time; provided, however, that any determination required to be made
with respect to whether an Indemnified Party\'s conduct complies with the
standards set forth under the DGCL, the Organizational Documents of the
Company or any such agreement, as the case may be, shall be made by
independent legal counsel jointly selected by such Indemnified Party and
Parent; and provided, further, that nothing in this Section 6.13 shall impair
any rights of any Indemnified Party. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, in the event that any Indemnified Party becomes involved
in any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation
covered by this Section 6.13 after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
promptly advance to such Indemnified Party his or her legal or other expenses
(including the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in
connection therewith), subject to the providing by such Indemnified Party of
an undertaking to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the event of a non-
appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled thereto.   (b) The Surviving
Corporation shall maintain the Company\'s existing officers\' and directors\'
liability insurance ("DandO; Insurance") for a period of six years after the
Effective Time so long as the annual premium therefor is not in excess of
300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof (the "Current
Premium"); provided, however, that if the existing DandO; Insurance expires, is
terminated or cancelled during such six-year period or is at an annual
premium in excess of 300% of the Current Premium, the Surviving Corporation
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as much DandO; Insurance
as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for a premium not in
excess of 300% (on an annualized basis) of the Current Premium.   (c) If the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or     -41-   substantially all of
its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.13.   (d) The provisions of this
Section 6.13 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.   6.14. Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and its Board of Directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that
such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
transactions.   6.15. Parent Name. After the Effective Time, Parent will
take all commercially reasonable efforts to amend its Organizational
Documents to change its name to "Moore Wallace Incorporated."   6.16.
Section 16(b). The Board of Directors of the Company and Parent shall, prior
to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) to exempt (i)
the conversion of Shares into cash or Parent Common Stock, (ii) the
conversion of rights to receive deferred Shares into rights to receive cash
or Parent Common Stock and (iii) the acquisition of Parent Common Stock and
the right to receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement by officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees or
directors of the Company who may become an officer or director of Parent
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
Parent and the Company shall provide to counsel to the other party copies of
the resolutions to be adopted by the respective Boards of Directors to
implement the foregoing.   ARTICLE VII   Conditions   7.1. Conditions to

transactions contemplated hereby by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
have been made or obtained (as the case may be), other than any immaterial

representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement
other than those listed in the preceding sentence, shall be true and correct,
without giving effect to any "material adverse effect" or other materiality
qualifiers within such representations and warranties, as of the Closing Date
as though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and could not
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent or to materially burden or materially impair the ability of the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent
shall have received a signed certificate of a senior executive officer of the
Company to such effect.   (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The

the consent or approval of each Person whose consent or approval shall be
required under any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

a Company Material Adverse Effect or is not reasonably likely to prevent or
to materially burden or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Since the date hereof, there shall not have
been any effect, change or development that, individually or in the aggregate
with other such effects, changes or developments, has had, or could
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (e)
Financing. Parent shall have entered into definitive financing agreements and

the Company to effect the Merger is also subject to the satisfaction or
waiver by the Company at or prior to the Effective Time of the following
conditions:   (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of Parent set forth in Sections 5.2(a) (Capitalization of Merger
Sub), 5.2(b) (Organization, Good Standing and Qualification), 5.2(c) (Capital

correct with respect to those matters that are qualified by Parent Material
Adverse Effect or materiality and shall be true     -44-   and correct
in all material respects with respect to those matters that are not so
qualified, in each case as of the Closing Date as though made on and as
of the Closing Date (except to the extent any such representation and
warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date). The representations and
warranties of Parent set forth in this Agreement other than those listed in
the preceding sentence shall be true and correct, without giving effect to
any "material adverse effect" or other materiality qualifiers within such
representations and warranties, as of the Closing Date as though made on the
Closing Date (except to the extent any such representation and warranty
expressly speaks as of an earlier date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or to materially burden or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall have received a signed
certificate of a senior executive officer of Parent to such effect.   (b)

Under Agreements. Parent shall have obtained the consent or approval of each
Person whose consent or approval shall be required in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Contract to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except those for which failure
to obtain such consents or approvals, individually or in the aggregate, is
not reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or is
not reasonably likely to prevent or to materially burden or materially impair
the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (d) Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Since the date hereof,
there shall not have been any effect, change or development that,
individually or in the aggregate with other such effects, changes or
developments, has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Parent

FORM OF COMPANY AFFILIATE LETTER    ___________,
2003  [Parent] [Address]   Ladies and Gentlemen:   I have been advised
that as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Wallace
Computer Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), as such term
is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules
and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act").   Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of January 16, 2003 (as it may be amended, supplemented or
modified from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), among the Company, Moore
Corporation Limited ("Parent"), and M-W Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Merger Sub
will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). Capitalized terms
used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Merger Agreement.   I have been advised that the issuance of
the Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act on a Registration
Statement on Form S-4. I have also been advised, however, that since I may be
deemed to be an affiliate of the Company at the time the Merger Agreement is
submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Company, my ability to sell,
assign or transfer any Parent Common Stock that I receive in exchange for any
shares of common stock, without par value, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such sale, assignment
or transfer is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available. I understand that such exemptions are limited and
I have obtained advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such
exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to the
sale of such Securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the
Securities Act.   I hereby represent and warrant to and covenant with
Parent that I will not sell, assign or transfer any shares of Parent Common
Stock except (i) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, (ii) by a sale made in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 (and otherwise in accordance with Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, if I am an affiliate of Parent and if so required at the
time) or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion of independent counsel
reasonably   A-1   satisfactory to Parent or as described in a "no-
action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission reasonably satisfactory to Parent, is not required to be
registered under the Securities Act. In the event of a sale of shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, I will supply Parent with evidence
of compliance with such Rule, in the form of customary seller\'s and
broker\'s Rule 145 representation letters or as Parent may otherwise
reasonably request.   I understand that Parent is under no obligation to
register the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of the shares of
Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take
any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from
such registration available solely as a result of the Merger.   I
acknowledge and agree that appropriate legends will be placed on certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to me or held by a
transferee thereof, which legends will be removed if (i) one year shall have
elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the
Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then available to me, (ii)
two years shall have elapsed from the date I acquired the Parent Common Stock
received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then
applicable to me, or (iii) Parent has received either an opinion of counsel,
which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a
"no action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule
145 under the Securities Act no longer apply to me.   I further understand
and agree that Parent may instruct the registrar for the Parent Common Stock
not to register the transfer of any Parent Common Stock held by me unless any
such transfer is made in accordance with this letter agreement.   Execution
of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part that I am an
"affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph of this
letter, or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I
am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.   This letter
agreement constitutes the complete understanding between Parent and me
concerning the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement shall be governed
by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts to be performed wholly in the State of
Delaware.   If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so
indicate by signing below and returning a copy of this letter to the
undersigned, at which time this letter shall become a binding agreement
between us.     A-2    Very truly yours,
