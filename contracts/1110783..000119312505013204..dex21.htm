Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock in the Merger (" _Dissenting Shares_
"), shall not, in the case of the Company Common Stock, be converted into or
be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and
until such holder of Company Common Stock as the case may be, fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL (and, in the case of the Preferred Stock, shall be treated in
accordance with the DGCL). If, after the Effective Time, any such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such Dissenting
Shares shall: (w) in the case of Company Common Stock, thereupon be treated as
if such shares had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled,
without interest or dividends thereon; and (x) in the case of Company
Preferred Stock, be treated in accordance with the DGCL. The Company shall
give Parent (y) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, if
applicable, attempted written withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to  



 

-12-  stockholders rights to appraisal with respect to the Merger; and (z) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any exercise of such appraisal rights under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for payment of fair value for capital stock of the
Company, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal
of any such demands.



SECTION 3.10. _List of Other Equity Awards; Treatment of Other Equity Awards_.



(a) Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
complete list (the " _Award List_ ") of each option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Stock Option_ ") and each restricted stock unit ( "
_RSU_ ") granted under each employee and director stock incentive or
compensation plan, agreement or arrangement (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ")
outstanding as of the date hereof (along with the exercise prices thereof, if
applicable).



(b) At the Award Cancellation Time, each then-outstanding Stock Option and RSU
(whether vested or unvested), shall be canceled and, in consideration of such
cancellation, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder on the
first Business Day following the Award Cancellation Time, in full satisfaction
of such Stock Option or RSU, as applicable, less any applicable withholding
tax, an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) (x) in the case of any
Stock Option, the excess of the Per Share Amount over the exercise price per
share of such unexercised Stock Option, if any, or (y) in the case of any RSU,
the Per Share Amount and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Stock Option, or RSU, as applicable.



(c) The Company shall (i) take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the
actions and effects specified in Section 3.10(b) to occur, (ii) take
all actions reasonably necessary, with Parents assistance, to ensure that,
effective as of the Award Cancellation Time, no holder of Stock Options or RSU
will have any right to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company or,
if applicable, the Surviving Corporation, upon exercise of any Stock Option
or settlement of any RSU, as applicable, or any other event, and (iii) provide
its reasonable cooperation to Parent in connection with the actions
contemplated by this Section 3.10. 



SECTION 3.11. _Payment for Shares_.



(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof but in no
event later than the earlier of (i) 30 days after the date hereof and (ii)
five days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall mail by overnight courier to
each record holder of an outstanding Certificate(s), whose shares of Company
Common Stock are to be converted pursuant to Section 3.8(d) into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate(s) to
Parent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions not
inconsistent with this Agreement as Parent may reasonably designate), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration (together, the " _Transmittal
Documents_ "). Upon surrender of a Certificate(s) for cancellation to Parent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together
with such letter of transmittal and any other required documents, duly
executed,  



 

-13-  the holder of such Certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor as of the Effective Time the Merger Consideration in respect of
all shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such surrendered
Certificate(s), without any interest thereon, pursuant to Section 3.8(d). The
Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the
Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate(s) is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on the
Certificate(s) or any related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and
that the Person requesting such payment shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate(s) surrendered have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of and as
contemplated by this Section 3.11, any Certificate(s) (other than
Certificate(s) representing shares of Company Common Stock subject to Sections
3.8(b) and (c) and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed, at any time
after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash without interest as contemplated by this Section 3.11.
Upon the surrender of a Certificate(s) in accordance with the terms and
instructions contained in the Transmittal Documents, Parent shall pay to the
holder of such Certificate(s) in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration (other than Certificate(s) representing shares of
Company Common Stock subject to Sections 3.8(b) and (c) and other
than Dissenting Shares) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account(s) designated by such holder on or before (i) the Closing Date, if
such holder surrendered such documentation to the Parent on or prior to
12:00p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day preceding the Closing
Date, or (ii) the second Business Day after such delivery, if such delivery is
made after such time.



(b) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall not be any further registration of transfers of
any shares of capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If,
after the Effective Time, a Certificate (other than those subject to Sections
3.8(b) and (c)) is presented to the Surviving Corporation, it shall be
canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth, in this Section 3.11. No interest shall accrue
or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of a Certificate.



(c) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
shall cease to have any rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates except as otherwise provided herein or by
applicable law.



(d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the relevant portion
of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.8(d) for shares of
Company Common Stock represented thereby. When authorizing such payment of any
portion of the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor, Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to give the Surviving
Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



 

-14- (e) Promptly following the date that is one year after the Effective Time,
holders of Certificates shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws) only as a
general creditor thereof with respect to any portion of the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any
interest thereon.



(f) The Merger Consideration paid in the Merger shall be net to the holder of
shares of Company Common Stock in cash, subject to reduction only for any
applicable required federal, state, local or foreign withholding Taxes. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such withholding was made.



(g) Anything to the contrary in this Section 3.11 notwithstanding, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If Certificates are not surrendered prior to
two years after the Effective Time, unclaimed funds payable with respect to
such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.



SECTION 3.12. _Co-Investment Rights_.



(a) Subject to the terms of Section 3.12(b), provided that the holder of co-
investment rights set forth in any of the Co-Investment Agreements (the "Co-
Investment Rights") has executed the Support Agreement, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in the Co-Investment Agreement applicable
to such Co-Investment Rights, on the Closing Date, such Co-Investment Rights
will be terminated, and, in consideration of such termination, the Company
shall pay to the holder of such Co-Investment Rights as of the Effective Time,
in full satisfaction of its Co-Investment Rights, less any applicable
withholding tax, an amount in cash (a " _Co-Investment Rights Payment_ ")
equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Per Share Amount over $3.40 and
(ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that each holder of Co-
Investment Rights is entitled to receive pursuant to its Co-Investment Rights
as set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.



(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Marinet may, no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, deliver to Parent a
notice informing Parent that Marinet elects to reduce the Co-Investment Rights
Payment it would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.12(a)
in exchange for the contingent value right described in the CVR Agreement
(the " _CVR Option Notice_ "). In the event Marinet delivers to Parent a CVR
Option Notice in accordance with this Section 3.12(b), (i) the Co-Investment
Rights Payment otherwise payable to Marinet pursuant to Section 3.12(a) will
be reduced by $50,000,000 and (ii) Parent and Marinet will execute and deliver
the CVR Agreement at the Closing.



SECTION 3.13. _Warrant Agreements_. Provided that the holder of outstanding
warrants to purchase Company Common Stock (the "Warrants") granted under any
of the Warrant Agreements has executed the Support Agreement, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in the Warrant Agreement applicable to such
Warrants, upon consummation of the Merger,  



 

-15-  such Warrants, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be acquired
by the Company for cancellation in consideration of payment to the holder of
such Warrants of an amount in respect thereof equal to the product of (A) the
excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the per share exercise price
thereof and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto
(such payment to be net of applicable required withholding taxes) as set
forth in Section 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

antitrust or merger control matters. Neither the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or the Related Agreements to which it is a party

or the lapse of time or both would constitute a default, breach or violation)
of any term, condition or provision of (a) its certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or similar governing documents), (b) any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is now a party or

bound or (c) any order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or
regulation applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets, except in the case of (b) or (c) above for

Knowledge, against any Person whose liability for any Environmental Claim the

retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law.



(c) The only representations and warranties given in respect of environmental

complete and accurate list of all real property (including land, buildings
and other improvements) and interests in real property owned by the Company
or its Subsidiaries that exceed $200,000 in value (the " _Owned Real Property_
"), including, for each parcel of Owned Real Property, a description
thereof, including the approximate size and use of the property. Section
4.18(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule also sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all real property leased, subleased or otherwise occupied by
the Company or its Subsidiaries that require annual payments in excess of (or
reasonably expected to be in excess of ) $100,000 (the " _Leased Real
Property_ "), which description shall include (for all Leased Real Property) a
list of all leases and subleases (and amendments and modifications)
pertaining thereto and approximate size of the premises leased thereunder, and
the use of such premises. The Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property
shall be hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Real Property_." The
Company or its Subsidiaries has good and valid fee or leasehold title (as the
case may be) to the Real Property, free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Liens. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Permitted Liens  



 

-31-  do not and will not impair or adversely affect the value of any Real
Property, the current or contemplated (the term "contemplated," as used
in this Section 4.18(a), meaning contemplated or planned prior to the Closing
Date) use, occupancy or operation thereof, or the business, operations or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
All aspects of the Real Property are in compliance in all respects with any
and all restrictions and other provisions included in the Permitted Liens, and
there are no matters which create, or which with notice or the passage of time
would create, a default under any of the documents evidencing the Permitted
Liens, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The Company owns or leases all of the real property used to conduct the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the manner conducted prior
to the date hereof. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, all buildings, structures,
improvements and fixtures located on, under, over or within each of the Real
Properties and all other aspects of each of the Real Properties: (i) are in
good operating condition and repair and are structurally sound and free of any
material defects, with no material alterations or repairs being required
thereto under applicable law or insurance company requirements; (ii) consist
of sufficient land and improvements and lawful means of access and utility
service to permit the use thereof in the manner and for the purposes to which
they are presently devoted or to which they are contemplated to be devoted;
and (iii) are located adjacent to public roads or streets with adequate
ingress and egress available between such roads or streets and such Real
Property for all purposes related to the current operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and are otherwise suitable and adequate for their current
use, operation and occupancy.



(c) There are no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened material
proceedings regarding the amount of the Taxes on, or the assessed valuation
of, any Real Property, or relating to eminent domain or the condemnation of
any portion of the Real Property, or impact fees, special assessments or
similar matters with respect thereto. To the Companys Knowledge, no such
action or proceeding is contemplated.



(d) All certificates, permits, variances or licenses from any
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over any of the Real Property and all
agreements, easements or other rights that are necessary to permit the lawful
use and operation of the buildings and improvements, in the manner such
buildings and improvements are used and operated on any of the Real Property
have been obtained and are in full force and effect and there is no pending
threat of modification or cancellation of any of same, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(e) All of the Real Property Leases are valid, binding and in full force and
effect. True and complete copies of the Real Property Leases have previously
been delivered to Parent, including all amendments or modifications thereof
and all side letters or other instruments affecting the obligations of any
party thereunder. The lessee (identified in Section 4.18(a)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) under each Real Property Lease is now in possession of
the Leased Real Property. There is no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened suit, action or proceeding that might interfere with the quiet
enjoyment of each tenant. There are no outstanding defaults or circumstances
that, upon the giving of notice or passage of  



 

-32-  time or both, would constitute a default or breach by either party under any
Real Property Lease. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not
assigned, mortgaged, pledged or otherwise encumbered, in any material manner,
their interest, if any, under any Real Property Lease. Between the date hereof
and the Closing, the Company or its Subsidiaries will exercise within the time
prescribed in each Real Property Lease any option provided therein to extend
or renew the term thereof, (i) so long as such Real Property Lease is still
necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as conducted during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004 and (ii) since
such time an alternate lease has not been entered into with terms, in the
aggregate, generally not less favorable to the Company or its Subsidiaries. As
used herein, the term "lease" shall also include subleases and the term
"lessee" shall also include any sublessee.



SECTION 4.19. _Tangible Personal Property; Sufficiency of Assets_.



(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and valid title, free and clear
of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), to all tangible personal property
that they use in the operation of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including all such tangible personal property reflected in the
Company Balance Sheet as being owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
except for such tangible personal property disposed of to third parties since
September 30, 2004 in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice and which disposals would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The tangible personal property of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is generally in good working order, reasonable
wear and tear excepted, and is suitable for the use for which it is intended
in all material respects.



(b) Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company and its Subsidiaries
will own or have valid rights to use all of the rights, facilities, assets,
properties and interests which are used in, and are sufficient for, the
operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the manner in
which such business was conducted during the fiscal year ended September 30,
2004 and since such time in all material respects.

agreement, dated October 13, 2004, from the Parent to the Company and Alfonso
Romo Garza (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, no later than 30 days
following the end of each month and 45 days following the end of each
quarter, prepare and deliver to Parent upon completion the balance sheet,

Effective Time.

 



SECTION 6.6. _Additional Agreements, Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under any applicable laws, rules or regulations to consummate
and make effective as promptly as practicable the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements,
including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and
notices required to be filed to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the taking of such actions as
are necessary to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, orders, exemptions
or waivers by any third party, including any Governmental Entity, and (ii) the
satisfaction of the other parties conditions to the consummation of the
Merger and the Related Transactions. Without limiting this Section
6.6, Parent and the Company shall each use its commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree,
order, or judgment that would restrain or prevent the Closing, on or before
the Outside Date, including defending through litigation on the  



 

-41-  merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person. In addition, no party
hereto shall take any action after the date hereof that would reasonably
be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining,
any permission, approval or consent from any Governmental Entity, necessary to
be obtained prior to the consummation of the Merger and the Related
Transactions.

 



(b) At Parents expense, the Company agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with
its efforts to refinance the Companys existing Indebtedness in connection
with the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ that in no event shall the
Company be required to accelerate payment under, or otherwise take any action
that would adversely affect its rights or obligations under, any of its
existing Indebtedness prior to the Effective Time.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and Parent or its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall permit the other
parties hereto to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed written (or
any material proposed oral) communication with any Governmental Entity
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Related Agreements. The Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Parent or its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall promptly inform the
other parties hereto of, and if in writing, furnish the other parties with
copies of (or, in the case of material oral communication, advise the other
parties orally of) any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Related
Agreements. If the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or
its Affiliates, on the other hand, receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger or the Related Transactions, then such party will
endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other parties hereto,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request. None of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or its Affiliates, on the
other hand, shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger or the Related Transactions unless it consults with the
other parties hereto in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat. To the extent not otherwise provided in this Section
6.6(c), the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent or its
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall furnish the other parties hereto with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications between it and any
such Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger; _provided_ , that either
the Company or Parent or an Affiliate of Parent may redact any information
from such correspondence, filings, and communications that discusses or
reflects its valuation of the Merger. Tax return filings in the ordinary
course and Tax proceedings with a Governmental Entity shall not be subject to
the above provisions of this Section 6.6(c). The Company or its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and Parent or its Affiliates, on the other hand, shall
furnish the other parties hereto with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in
connection with their preparation of necessary filings or submissions of
information to any Governmental Entity. To the extent that transfers of
Company Permits are required as a result of execution of this Agreement or the
Related Agreements or consummation of the Merger, the Company and Parent shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to effect such transfers.



 

-42- (d) Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to identify and secure or provide any
consents or notices required as a result of the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or the Related Agreements or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.



SECTION 6.7. _Public Announcements_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, as
the case may be, will consult with each other before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement, the
Related Agreements, the Merger, the Related Transactions or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of
the other parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national market system to which Parent, its Affiliates, the Company or its
Subsidiaries is a party.



SECTION 6.8. _Director and Officer Indemnification_.



(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification
or exculpation now existing in favor of the directors, officers, employees
and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or other governing documents) or
otherwise in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect after the Effective Time. Any rights to indemnification
or exculpation pursuant to this Section 6.8(a) shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at
the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or agents of the
Company.



(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to
the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and each such individual who served at the request of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts
paid in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil,
administrative or investigative, based on the fact that such individual is or
was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission occurring at or before
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby). The
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to assume the defense of any such
claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of separate counsel
or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party advises
that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Party or such  



 

-43-  Indemnified Party shall have legal defenses available to it that are
different from or in addition to those available to the Surviving Corporation,
the Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as
statements therefor are received; _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for the fees of more than one counsel with respect to a
particular claim, action, suit, investigation or proceeding, for all
Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel, unless a conflict of interest
shall be caused thereby; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).



(c) The Surviving Corporation shall provide or maintain in effect for six
years from the Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ "), through the purchase of
"run-off" coverage or otherwise, directors and officers and corporate
liability insurance covering those individuals who are covered by the
directors and officers and corporate liability insurance policy provided for
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof (the " _Existing Policy_ ") on terms (other than with respect to
minimum aggregate limits of liability for directors and officers and
corporate liability insurance coverage) comparable to the Existing Policy and
such coverage shall contain minimum aggregate limits of liability for
directors and officers and corporate liability insurance coverage for
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries of at least $10
million and deductibles no larger than those customary for such type
of insurance coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of $1,000,000 in
aggregate premiums for such insurance coverage with respect to the Tail
Period, and if the premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to maintain or obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.



(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.8.



(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 6.8 shall be in
addition to any rights such individual may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or other governing documents) of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, under the DGCL or any other applicable laws or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.



SECTION 6.9. _No Solicitation_.



(a) Except as set forth in this Section 6.9, the Company agrees that,
during the term of this Agreement, it shall not, and shall not authorize or
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its or its Subsidiaries directors,  



 

-44-  officers, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, agents or
representatives, directly or indirectly, not to (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or facilitate, or furnish or disclose non-public
information in furtherance of, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
with respect to a Company Competing Transaction, (ii) negotiate, explore or
otherwise engage in discussions with, or furnish any information to, any
Person (other than Parent, or its directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) with respect to any Company Competing Transaction, or (iii)
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to a
Company Competing Transaction. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Companys and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers, investment
bankers, consultants, attorneys, agents and representatives immediately to
cease all existing activities, discussions and negotiations with any parties
conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any inquiries or proposals
relating to a Company Competing Transaction.



(b) The Company Board shall not approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Company Competing Transaction.



(c) From and after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly
advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information or of any
proposal in connection with a Company Competing Transaction, the material
terms and conditions of such request or proposal and the identity of the
Person making such request or proposal.



SECTION 6.10. _Resignation of Directors_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent of
the resignation of all directors of the Company (other than those directors
set forth in a written notice of Parent to the Company), such resignations to
become effective as of the Effective Time.



SECTION 6.11.  _Privilege_. The parties agree and acknowledge that the
disclosure, provision or furnishing of information, directly or indirectly, by
the Company under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any privilege
under applicable law that has been or may be asserted, including privileges
arising under or relating to the attorney-client relationship (which shall
include the attorney-client and work product privileges).



SECTION 6.12. _Employee Matters_.



(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the employees of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time who continue employment,
employee benefit programs that provide employee compensation and benefits that
are, in the aggregate, generally comparable to those provided under employee
benefit programs provided for employees of the Company generally as of the
date hereof; _provided_ , that, other than as required by applicable law or
employment agreements binding upon the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries (in the absence of the consent of the individuals party to
such employment agreements), the Surviving Corporation may at any time
increase or reduce the level of such benefit programs if such an increase or
reduction shall be determined to be advisable in the sole business judgment
of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section
6.12(a) shall not be  



 

-45-  construed as a guarantee of continued employment of the Companys employees
for a specified period.



(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits
(but not benefit accrual under pension or similar plans) under the employee
benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the "New
Plans"), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit
plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in
a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company employee benefit plans
or compensation arrangements or agreements in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be
waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.



(c) For a period of at least one year following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall continue and cause to be honored the
Companys severance plan/policy listed on Section 6.12(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule as in effect prior to the Effective Time without any
amendments adverse to Company Employees.



(d) The Companys annual bonuses for the fiscal year ending in 2005 under the
Companys Executive Incentive Plan shall be determined based upon the
incentive compensation targets set forth in Section 6.12(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.



(e) Each party hereto shall use all reasonable efforts, at request of the
other, to take all actions necessary and sufficient to satisfy any notice
or information requirements relating to disclosure of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement (i) to each works council or other similar
body established or maintained for the benefit of the employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, as may be required under applicable law or
regulation in the jurisdiction in which such employees are employed by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) to any Governmental Entity, as may be
required under applicable law or otherwise from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (iii) as may be required under any collective bargaining
agreement  



 

-46-  applicable to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. A list of
such notice or information requests is set forth in Section 6.12(e) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.



SECTION 6.13. _Interests in Subsidiaries_. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause, effective as of the Effective Time, each
person set forth in Exhibit E hereto to transfer to Parent or Parents
designee all equity interests held by such Person in the Subsidiary or
Subsidiaries of the Company set forth opposite such Persons name on Exhibit
E.



SECTION 6.14. _Management Agreement_. The Company shall terminate the
Management Agreement at or prior to Closing.



SECTION 6.15. _Debt_.

Seeds, Inc. to comply with its obligation to make a "Change of Control Offer"
in accordance with Section 4.08 of the Company Indenture.
