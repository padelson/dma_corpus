Section 2.1 Purchase and Sale. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, at the Closing, (a) each of the Sellers (other than the
Reorganization Parties) shall sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to
the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase from each such Seller, its Company
Shares and (b) each of the Reorganization Parties shall sell, convey,
transfer, assign and deliver to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase from
each such Reorganization Party, its Holdco Shares, in each case free and clear
of all Encumbrances.

  

  

Section 2.2 Purchase Price. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, in consideration of the sale of the Company Shares and the
Holdco Shares, at the Closing, the Buyer shall pay to LaBarge Weinstein, as
nominee of the Sellers' Representative, in full satisfaction of the Buyer's
payment obligation under this Section 2.2, an aggregate amount in cash equal
to the U.S. Dollar equivalent of $208,790,767 Canadian Dollars (the "Initial
Cash Amount"), payable in Canadian dollars in accordance with Section 2.6(a)
and as adjusted in accordance with Section 2.3(b) (the "Purchase Price"), such
that the aggregate purchase price payable by the Buyer (a) to the Sellers
under this Section 2.2 and (b) to the Minority Shareholders under the Minority
Purchase Agreements, shall be $213 Million Canadian Dollars, as adjusted in
accordance with Section 2.3(b). The Purchase Price shall be subject to further
adjustment to the extent of the Closing Adjustment Amount, if any, as provided
in Section 2.4(e).

  

  

Section 2.3 Pre-Closing Working Capital Adjustment. (a) No later than the
second Business Day prior to the Parties' good faith estimate of the Closing
Date, the Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, the Estimated
Working Capital Statement, which shall set forth the Company's good faith
estimate of Working Capital, including the Current Assets and the Current
Liabilities, of the Transferred Companies as of the Closing (based on the
definitions, approach and related assumptions agreed to by the Parties herein
and in the form of the example provided in Schedule D). Upon completion of the
Estimated Working Capital Statement, the Company shall deliver the Estimated
Working Capital Statement to the Buyer.

  

  

(b) The Initial Cash Amount shall be adjusted by an amount (the "Pre-Closing
Adjustment Amount") equal to the Base Working Capital less the Estimated
Working Capital and expressed as a positive, if positive, or as a negative, if
negative. If (x) the Pre-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then
the Initial Cash Amount shall be decreased, and (y) if the Pre-Closing
Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the Initial Cash Amount shall be
increased, in each case by the Pre-Closing Adjustment Amount and the resulting
amount shall be the Purchase Price, including for purposes of the payment
obligation of the Buyer under Section 2.6(a). If the Pre-Closing Adjustment
Amount is equal to zero, then no adjustment shall be made and the Initial Cash
Amount shall be the Purchase Price.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 2.4 Closing Working Capital Adjustment. (a) As soon as practicable,
but in no event more than 45 days, following the Closing, the Buyer shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, the Closing Date Working Capital Statement,
which shall set forth the Working Capital, including the Current Assets and
the Current Liabilities, of the Transferred Companies as of the Closing (based
on the definitions, approach and related assumptions agreed to by the Parties
herein and in the form of the example provided in Schedule D). In preparing
the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, the Buyer shall utilize the Tax
Payable and Tax Receivable calculations prepared by PWC and delivered to Buyer
within such 45-day period. Upon completion of the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement, the Buyer shall deliver the Closing Date Working Capital Statement
to PWC, with a copy to the Sellers' Representative, and the Buyer and the
Sellers' Representative shall cause PWC to audit the Closing Date Working
Capital Statement (based on the definitions, approach and related assumptions
agreed to by the Parties herein and in the form of the example provided in
Schedule D) and to deliver the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, with
such adjustments, if any, as its deems necessary, together with its audit
report thereon, to the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative no later than 45
days after the delivery of the Closing Date Working Capital Statement to PWC.

  

  

(b) The Sellers and the Buyer shall complete their review of the Closing Date
Working Capital Statement and the calculation of the Closing Date Working
Capital within 30 days after delivery thereof to the Sellers' Representative
and the Buyer by PWC (the "Review Period"). If either the Sellers or the Buyer
in good faith disputes all or any part of the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement, the Sellers' Representative or the Buyer, as the case may be,
shall, on or before the last day of the Review Period, so inform the Buyer (in
the case of the Sellers) or the Sellers' Representative (in the case of the
Buyer) in writing (the "Objection"), setting forth a description in reasonable
detail of the basis of their or its determination and proposed adjustments to
the Closing Date Working Capital Statement and the corresponding adjustments
to the Closing Date Working Capital that the Sellers or the Buyer, as the case
may be, believe should be made. If no Objection is received by the Buyer or
the Sellers' Representative on or before the last day of the Review Period,
then the Closing Date Working Capital set forth on the Closing Date Working
Capital Statement delivered by PWC shall be final, conclusive and binding upon
the Parties.

  

  

(c) If an Objection is received by the Buyer or the Sellers' Representative on
or before the last day of the Review Period, and if the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with respect
to the proposed adjustments set forth in the relevant Objection(s), either
Party may refer the matter to the CPA/CA Firm, which, acting as experts and
not as arbitrators, shall determine, on the basis set forth herein and in
accordance with the definitions, approach and related assumptions agreed to by
the Buyer and the Sellers herein and in the form of the example provided in
Schedule D, whether and to what extent, if any, the Closing Date Working
Capital Statement and the Closing Date Working Capital require adjustment (in
their entirety and not, for greater certainty, only as to the Objection,
unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative). The Buyer and the Sellers' Representative shall instruct the
CPA/CA Firm to deliver its written determination to the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative no later than 45 days after the matter is referred to the
CPA/CA Firm. The CPA/CA Firm's determination shall be final, conclusive and
binding upon the Buyer and the Sellers. The (i) fees and disbursements of the
CPA/CA Firm and (ii) the fees and disbursements of PWC in auditing and
adjusting, as necessary, the Closing

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

Date Working Capital Statement delivered by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.4(a),
but not, for greater certainty, any fees and disbursements of PWC in preparing
any Tax Receivable or Tax Payable calculations delivered by PWC pursuant to
Section 2.4(a) (the fees and disbursements referred to in clauses (i) and (ii)
being referred to herein as the "Working Capital Fees") shall be borne equally
by the Buyer and the Sellers (in the latter case, as a payment from amounts
set aside in respect of Acquisition Related Expenses pursuant to Section 6.14;
it being understood that, to the extent that the Sellers' share of the actual
Working Capital Fees exceeds the amount received by LaBarge Weinstein in
respect of estimated Working Capital Fees, the Sellers shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to the CPA/CA Firm or to PWC, as applicable, any such excess within
five Business Days after receipt of the Buyer's invoice therefor). The Buyer
and the Sellers shall make readily available to the CPA/CA Firm all relevant
Books and Records and any work papers (including those of the Parties'
respective accountants, to the extent permitted by such accountants) relating
to the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, the calculation of the Closing
Date Working Capital, any Objection and all other items reasonably requested
by the CPA/CA Firm in connection therewith.

  

  

(d) The Sellers shall have full access to all information used by the Buyer in
preparing the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, including the work
papers of its accountants (to the extent permitted by such accountants). The
Sellers' Representative shall reasonably cooperate with the Buyer in obtaining
all information used in the preparation of the Deferred Revenue, Tax Payable
and Tax Receivable information.

  

  

(e) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted by an amount (the "Closing Adjustment
Amount") equal to the Estimated Working Capital less the Closing Date Working
Capital. If the Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Closing Adjustment Amount and the
Sellers shall promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) after the
final determination thereof instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to the Buyer the
Closing Adjustment Amount, plus interest and other income earned on such funds
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement from the Closing Date to, but
not including, the date of payment, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Buyer. If the Closing Adjustment Amount
is a negative number, then the Purchase Price shall be increased by the
Closing Adjustment Amount and the Buyer shall promptly (and in any event
within five Business Days) after final determination thereof pay to the
Sellers' Representative or his nominee, for distribution to the Sellers, in
full satisfaction of the Buyer's payment obligations hereunder (except as
otherwise provided in Section 6.4(e)), the Closing Adjustment Amount, plus
interest in an amount equal to the interest and other income that would on
have been earned on a like amount of funds pursuant to the Escrow Agreement at
such time from the Closing Date to, but not including, the date of payment, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Sellers' Representative. If the Closing Adjustment Amount is equal to zero,
then no payment will be made by either the Buyer or the Sellers.

  

  

Section 2.5 Closing. The Closing shall take place at the offices of LaBarge
Weinstein Professional Corporation, 515 Legget Drive, Suite 800, Ottawa,
Ontario K2K 3G4 at 10:00 A.M., local time, on the third Business Day following

conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject
to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied or
waived, or at such other time and place as the Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is
called the "Closing Date." The Closing will be deemed to have been completed
at the Closing Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 2.6 Deliveries by the Buyer. At the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver

available funds by wire transfer to an account, which has been designated in
writing by the Sellers' Representative at least two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date;

  

  

(b) a duly executed counterpart of each Ancillary Agreement to which the Buyer
is a party;

  

  

(c) if the Closing occurs after the date of this Agreement, the certificate to

(f) such other customary instruments of transfer, assumptions, filings or

of delivery thereof to the Sellers' Representative or his nominee pursuant to
Section 2.6(a), the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent an amount in cash

"Escrow Amount"), payable in Canadian Dollars in immediately available funds
by wire transfer to an account designated by the Escrow Agent.

contrary contained in this Agreement, the Buyer may elect to have any or all
of the Company Shares or Holdco Shares conveyed or transferred to one or more
of its Affiliates designated by the Buyer at least two Business Days before
the Closing Date; provided, however, that no such election shall relieve the
Buyer or the Parent of any of their obligations to the Sellers hereunder or
result in any adverse effect on any Seller, including, (i) any adverse effect
on the after-tax consideration to be received by any Seller in the
transactions contemplated herein, or (ii) any adverse effect on the Company,
to the extent that any Seller would have liability to the Buyer for any such
adverse effect pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 2.10 Reorganization. The Parties agree that they shall reasonably
cooperate to effect those aspects of the Reorganization prior to Closing that
are intended to enhance the after-tax proceeds of the transactions
contemplated hereby to Joseph Abdul-Nour, Simon Nehme and their respective
family trusts; provided, however, that the Reorganization shall not have any
adverse impact on the other Sellers, the Company or the Buyer. The Company and
the Sellers hereby irrevocably direct and shall cause LaBarge Weinstein to
reimburse Buyer promptly after Closing, from amounts received by LaBarge
Weinstein in respect of Acquisition Related Expenses pursuant to Section 6.14,
for all reasonable costs incurred by Buyer to evaluate or effect the
Reorganization (the "Reorganization Costs"); it being understood that, to the
extent that the Buyer's actual Reorganization Costs exceed the amount received
by LaBarge Weinstein in respect of estimated Reorganization Costs, the Sellers
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Buyer any such excess within five
Business Days after receipt of the Buyer's invoice therefor. Reorganization
Costs that are not otherwise reimbursed as of the Closing shall be treated as
a Current Liability, and any cash set aside or retained by the Company against
the payment of such Reorganization Costs shall be treated as a Current Asset,
for purposes of calculating Working Capital.

referred to and payable under this Agreement shall be in Canadian Dollars.

any Transferred Company or any other Person has breached any IP Contract.
Except as set forth in Section 4.13(j)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, there
exists no event, condition or occurrence that with the giving of notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach or default by any
Transferred Company or, to the Company's Knowledge, another Person under any
IP Contract. No party to any IP Contract has given any of the Transferred
Companies notice of its intention to cancel, terminate, change the scope of
rights under, or fail to renew any IP Contract. Neither the Company nor any
other Transferred Company nor, to the Company's Knowledge, any other party to
any IP Contract has repudiated in writing any material provision thereof.

rights of any third party.

required by each Transferred Company in connection with its Business as
currently conducted, and, except as set forth in Section 4.13(m) of the
Disclosure Schedule, have not materially malfunctioned or failed within the
past two years. The IT Assets do not contain any "time bombs," "Trojan

Section 6.1 Access and Information. Subject to, and in accordance with, the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreements, from the date hereof
until the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the Subsidiary to, make
full disclosure to the Buyer and its Permitted Representatives (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreements) of all the information that is reasonably
requested by the Buyer with regard to the Transferred Companies.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement or any other
agreement between the Parties shall obligate the Company or the Subsidiary to
disclose to the Buyer, or its agents or representatives, prior to the Closing,
any information concerning (a) the Mutual Litigation, (b) source code for any
software owned or used by the Transferred Companies, or (c) the names or other
identifying information (email, phone, mailing or IP address, etc.) of any
customers (except in the case of a random sampling of an agreed upon number of
customers performed by an independent third party agent of Buyer for
verification purposes only). No investigation pursuant to this Section shall
alter any representation or warranty given hereunder by the Sellers or the
Company. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section shall be
directed to the Sellers' Representative or such Person or Persons as may be
designated by the Sellers' Representative. All information received pursuant
to this Section shall be governed by Section 6.10 and the Confidentiality
Agreements, together with any other agreement entered into regarding the
confidentiality and/or dissemination of information of the Company to the
Buyer or to its counsel. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if, in
the opinion of counsel to the Company, it may be potentially harmful to
disclose certain documents or information to the Buyer, having regards to the
competitive and/or litigation position of the Company in the event the Closing
is not consummated pursuant to this Agreement, then such documents or
information shall not be provided to the Buyer, the Parent or any of their
Representatives.

Section 6.3 Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Each of the Parties hereto shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to fulfill as promptly as practicable
the conditions precedent to the obligations hereunder of the Buyer or the
Sellers, as the case may be, including obtaining, giving or making, as
applicable, all consents, approvals, waivers, authorizations, notices and
filings required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company and the Buyer will consult and cooperate with one another in good
faith in connection therewith, including by providing drafts of any requests
for consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations, and of any notices or
filings, to the Buyer (in the case of the Company) or the Sellers'

if requested, giving due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested in connection therewith.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that, to the extent any

Investment Canada Act or U.S. Antitrust Laws after Closing, the Buyer shall be
entitled to control and direct the making of any such filings and submissions
and the resolution of any investigation or other inquiry by any Government
Entity under such Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
in each case consulting with the Sellers' Representative, as appropriate, and

Section 6.4 Tax Matters. (a) Tax Returns. The Sellers shall, in accordance
with past practice of the applicable Transferred Company (or the applicable
Holdco), prepare, or cause to be prepared, when due all Tax Returns that are
required to be prepared by or with respect to the Transferred Companies (or,
if such Seller is a Reorganization Party, the applicable Holdco) for taxable
years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the Buyer shall file
or cause to be filed when due such Tax Returns. The Sellers shall provide
drafts of all such Tax Returns to the Buyer for its review at least 30 days
prior to their respective due dates, shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments of the Buyer and shall reasonably cooperate with the Buyer
so that any Tax elections made in connection with the Reorganization do not

shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, when due, all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Transferred
Companies for taxable years or periods ending after the Closing Date. The
Sellers shall, subject to the last sentence of this Section, timely pay all
Taxes imposed on the Transferred Companies (or, if such Seller is a
Reorganization Party, the applicable Holdco) for the periods,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

or portions thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date, and the Buyer shall
timely pay all Taxes imposed on the Transferred Companies for the periods, or
portions thereof, beginning after the Closing Date. The covenants of the
Sellers contained in this Section 6.4(a) are several, and not joint or joint
and several, and the liability of each Seller under this Section shall not
exceed its Proportionate Amount of such liability up to its Proportionate
Amount of the Aggregate Indemnity Cap. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the Tax Payables of the Transferred Companies for the taxable years or periods
ending on or before the Closing Date are treated as Current Liabilities of the
Company, and related cash set aside for the payment of such Tax Liabilities is
included as a Current Asset, in each case for purposes of calculating Working
Capital, and Buyer covenants that it will cause such cash, to the extent
included as a Current Asset in the Closing Date Working Capital, to be
allocated to the payment of such Tax Liabilities in the Ordinary Course after
the Closing or, to the extent not required for such purpose, to be paid to the
Sellers' Representative or his nominee, for distribution to the Sellers, in
full satisfaction of the Buyer's payment obligations to the Sellers under this
Section 6.4(a), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Sellers' Representative.

  

  

(b) Information. Until the expiration of all periods allowed for objecting to
or appealing from the final determination of any proceedings relating to any
assessment or reassessment of the Transferred Companies in respect of the Tax
Returns that are required to be prepared by or with respect to the Transferred
Companies for taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
the Sellers and the Buyer agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Buyer (in the case of the Sellers) or the Sellers' Representative (in the case
of the Buyer), promptly upon reasonable request, such information and
assistance relating to the Transferred Companies as is reasonably necessary in
connection with the filing of any Tax Returns or elections related to Taxes,
the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority, the response to any
inquiry by a taxing authority, the mailing or filing of any notice and the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax
Returns or any other filing required to be made with any taxing authority or
any other matter related to Taxes. In addition, the Buyer and the Sellers
agree to maintain or arrange for the maintenance of all records necessary to
comply with this Section 6.4 for a period of seven years from the Closing Date
(or such longer period as may be reasonably requested in writing by the Buyer
or the Sellers' Representative) and each Party agrees to afford the other
reasonable access to such records during normal business hours.

  

  

(c) Transfer Taxes. Any excise, sales, use, value-added, goods and services,
harmonized sales, transfer, stamp, documentary or other similar Taxes and fees
(collectively, the "Transfer Taxes"), that are payable or that arise as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and any
recording or filing fees with respect thereto, will be borne by the Sellers in
their respective Proportionate Amounts. The party that has the primary legal
responsibility for the payment of any particular Transfer Tax shall prepare
and timely file all relevant Tax Returns required to be filed in respect of
such Transfer Tax and pay the Transfer Tax shown on such Tax return.

  

  

(d) No Changes in Tax Filings. The Buyer hereby covenants and agrees with the
Sellers and the Transferred Companies that, during the period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on the date that is six years from the Closing
Date, it shall not take any actions without the consent of the Sellers'
Representative (exercised in their sole discretion) to cancel,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

terminate, supplement or amend the Tax Returns prepared by the Company, except
as required by Law. In furtherance of Section 6.15(c), the Buyer hereby
covenants and agrees with the Sellers and the Transferred Companies that the
Buyer (a) shall, and shall cause the Company to, make the applicable elections
under draft paragraph 110(1.1)(a) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) to forego the
deduction of payments made to retire employee stock options pursuant to
Section 6.15(c), and (b) shall not, and shall cause the Transferred Companies
not to, rescind, amend or otherwise modify or seek to nullify any such
election.

  

  

(e) Distribution of Refunds. If, following the Closing Date, any Transferred
Company receives any amount payable to such Transferred Company by any
Government Entity in respect of a Tax Receivable that is in excess of the
amount of such Tax Receivable included as a Current Asset in the Closing Date
Working Capital in respect of any taxation or deemed taxation period or year
ending on or prior to the Closing Date (and without duplication of any payment
made by the Buyer to the Sellers pursuant to the last sentence of Section
6.4(a) hereof), then the Buyer shall, within 10 Business Days after the
receipt of such amount, cause the Company to pay to the Sellers'
Representative or his nominee, for distribution to the Sellers, in full
satisfaction of the Buyer's payment obligations under this Section 6.4(e),
such excess amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by the Sellers' Representative. Any payment made to the
Sellers pursuant to this Section shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes. The Buyer shall make good faith, commercially
reasonable efforts to collect all Tax refunds payable to any Transferred
Company in respect of any taxation or deemed taxation period or year ending on
or prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 6.5 Employee Benefits. (a) The Company shall cooperate with the Buyer
in making any and all appropriate government filings, giving employee notices
or taking any other actions reasonably necessary to maintain, amend, terminate
and administer the Compensation Plans as the Buyer deems fit.

  

  

(b) Prior to making any written or oral communications to any Employee
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall provide the Buyer with a
copy of the intended communication, the Buyer shall have a reasonable period
of time to review and comment on the communication, and the Buyer and the
Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable
communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that the Buyer
shall be entitled to control all such communications to Employees regarding
2010 Employee Bonuses in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the
Buyer shall provide the Sellers' Representative with a copy of the intended
communication.

  

  

Section 6.6 Ancillary Agreements. At the Closing, each of the Sellers and the
Company shall execute each Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party, and the
Buyer shall execute and deliver each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is a party.

  

  

Section 6.7 Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing Date, each
Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly execute, acknowledge
and deliver any other assurances or documents or instruments of transfer
reasonably requested by the Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be, and
necessary for the requesting party to satisfy its obligations hereunder or to
obtain the benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 6.8 Notification. From the date hereof until the Closing, (a) the
Company and the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand,
(the "First Party") shall promptly notify the other (the "Other Party") in
writing if the First Party or its respective Affiliates becomes aware of any
fact or condition that causes or constitutes a material breach of any of the
representations and warranties of such First Party as of the date hereof, or
if any First Party or their respective Affiliates becomes aware of the
occurrence after the date hereof of any fact or condition that could (except
as expressly contemplated hereby) cause or constitute a breach of any of the
representations and warranties of the First Party had such representation and
warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or
condition, and (b) the Other Party shall promptly notify the First Party (or
the Sellers' Representative in the case of the Company or the Sellers) in
writing if the Other Party becomes aware of any such fact, condition or
occurrence with respect to the representations and warranties of the First
Party. During the same period, (i) the First Party shall promptly notify the
Other Party of the occurrence of any breach of any covenant, agreement,
undertaking or obligation of the First Party contained in this Agreement or of
the occurrence of any event that may make the satisfaction of any of the
conditions in Article VI impossible or not reasonably likely, and (ii) the
Other Party shall promptly notify the First Party (or the Sellers'
Representative in the case of the Company or the Sellers) of the occurrence of
any breach of any covenant, agreement, undertaking or obligation of the First
Party contained herein or of the occurrence of any event that may make the
satisfaction of any condition in Article VII impossible or not reasonably
likely. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Buyer or any
of the Seller or the Company fails to timely perform any of its notification
obligations under this Section, such party's rights hereunder shall only be
affected to the extent such failure has a material prejudicial effect on the
defenses or rights of the other party.

  

  

Section 6.9 No Shop. Until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
and the Closing, the Sellers and the Company shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit any inquiries or proposals, or enter into any discussions,

direct or indirect disposition, whether by sale, merger or otherwise, of all
or any portion of the Transferred Shares or the Business to any Person other
than the Buyer or its Affiliates, or (ii) knowingly disclose, directly or
indirectly, to any Person any confidential information concerning the Company,
the Subsidiary or the Business except as necessary to conduct the Business in

its Affiliates to, treat as confidential and shall safeguard any and all
information, knowledge and data included in the assets of each Transferred
Company, in each case by using the same degree of care, but no less than a
reasonable standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination or
disclosure of such information, knowledge and data as such Seller or its
Affiliates used with respect thereto prior to the execution of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The Buyer and the Sellers acknowledge that the confidentiality obligations
set forth herein shall not extend to information, knowledge and data that is
publicly available or becomes publicly available through no act or omission of
any Seller, or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than a party owing a duty of confidentiality so long as such source is
not known by any Seller to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or
other obligations of secrecy to the Buyer or any Transferred Company or
required to be disclosed by a Government Entity.

  

  

(c) The Parties hereby agree that the confidentiality obligations outlined in
this Section 6.10 shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the
Confidentiality Agreements. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality
obligations hereunder by the Buyer or any of the Sellers, the Sellers or the
Buyer, as the case may be, in addition to all other available remedies, will
be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this Section in
any court of competent jurisdiction.

  

  

Section 6.11 Additional Financial Statements; Reissuance of Financial
Statements. (a) The Company will prepare and furnish to the Buyer as soon as
they become available, and in any event, not later than 15 days after the end
of each month, unaudited balance sheets and unaudited income statements for
the Company and the Subsidiary for each full monthly period prior to the
Closing and for the then current year-to-date. The Company will prepare each

basis in accordance with Canadian GAAP, subject to normal year-end adjustments
and the absence of footnotes and similar presentation items therein, and shall
cooperate with the Buyer in good faith to provide such other financial
information as the Buyer reasonably requires to fulfill its reporting
obligations under the applicable Securities Laws.

consolidated statement of income, changes in equity and cash flows for the
Company and the Subsidiary as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008 in accordance with Canadian GAAP with the inclusion of note
disclosure on the U.S. GAAP and Canadian GAAP differences; provided, however,
that the cost of such review and the relevant audit opinions (the "PWC Fees")
shall be borne by the Buyer and accordingly shall not, if applicable, be
reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement as a Current
Liability; it being further understood that, if the Company is requested by
the Buyer and agrees to commence the audit work contemplated under this
Section 6.11(b) prior to Closing, then the Buyer shall pay the PWC Fees if the
Closing does not occur.

  

  

Section 6.12 Updated Disclosure Schedule. The Company shall update the

in this Agreement or set forth in Section 6.13 of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company and each of the Sellers (to the extent such Seller or any of its
Affiliates is a party thereto) shall take all actions necessary to terminate,

Companies, on the one hand, and any of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates,
on the other hand. From and after the date hereof, each of the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates shall conduct all transactions with the
Transferred Companies only in the Ordinary Course, except as contemplated
hereby.

  

  

Section 6.14 Payment of Acquisition Related Expenses and Distribution of
Excess Cash. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall pay to LaBarge Weinstein
(to be set aside by LaBarge Weinstein in trust for payment conditional on
Closing) an amount in respect of all Acquisition Related Expenses and the
Company and the Sellers hereby irrevocably direct and shall cause LaBarge
Weinstein to make the applicable payments promptly after Closing. In the event
that any Acquisition Related Expenses are not paid by the Company as of the
Closing, such expenses shall be treated as Current Liabilities of the Company,
and any cash set aside or retained by the Company against the payment of such
expenses shall be treated as a Current Asset, for purposes of calculating
Working Capital. Subject to addressing the Acquisition Related Expenses (by
payment or setting aside or retention of cash for payment as aforesaid), and
immediately prior to Closing, the Company shall pay to LaBarge Weinstein (to
be set aside by LaBarge Weinstein in trust for payment conditional on Closing)
the balance of all cash and cash equivalents of the Company, other than an
amount, based on the Company's reasonable, good faith estimate (to be provided
to the Buyer concurrently with the Estimated Working Capital Statement),
required to be retained by the Company so as ensure that the Company's Working
Capital at Closing equals the Base Working Capital (the "Cash Distribution");
it being understood that the Option Holders' aggregate pro rata share of the
Cash Distribution, assuming the cancellation of all their respective options,
shall be added to the amount of Acquisition Related Expenses held in trust by
LaBarge. The Company and the Sellers hereby irrevocably direct and shall cause
LaBarge Weinstein to distribute to (a) the Escrow Agent, no later than the
Business Day following the Closing, an amount equal to 50% of the Escrow Fees
and (b) each Seller, promptly after Closing, (i) its pro rata share of the
Purchase Price, less an amount equal to 50% of the Escrow Fees and (ii) its
pro rata share of the Cash Distribution, and (c) each Minority Shareholder,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Minority Purchase Agreement, (i)
the applicable Purchase Price (as defined in the Minority Purchase Agreement)
and (ii) its pro rata share of the Cash Distribution. To the extent that any
Acquisition Related Expenses are not paid prior to Closing and cash is left in
the Company for the satisfaction of such Acquisition Related Expenses (and the
foregoing resulting treatment of the Working Capital applies), then the Buyer
shall promptly pay or cause the Company to promptly pay, any such Acquisition
Related Expenses using such cash.

  

  

Section 6.15 Post Closing Covenants of the Buyer. (a) The Buyer hereby
covenants and agrees with the Sellers and the Transferred Companies that,
during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that
is three years from the Closing, it shall not take any actions to cancel,
terminate, supplement, amend or let lapse the directors and officers insurance
policy (policy number 15010937, underwritten by Creechurch International
Underwriters Ltd.) without the prior written consent of the Sellers'
Representative, such policy having been fully pre-paid by the Company prior to
the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) The Buyer hereby covenants and agrees with the Sellers and the Transferred
Companies that, upon Closing, the Company shall cause all 2010 Employee
Bonuses to be fully accrued as if fully earned to December 31, 2010 and
treated as Current Liabilities of the Company for purposes of calculating
Working Capital (and the related amounts set aside for payment of such 2010
Employee Bonuses as a Current Asset), and shall cause the applicable
Transferred Company to pay to each Employee employed by such Transferred
Company as at the Closing Date such Employee's 2010 Employee Bonus in full and
without deductions (other than applicable statutory deductions) on March 30,
2011; provided, however that such Employee remains employed by the Company on
such date, except as set forth in Schedule F. Within 10 Business Days after
March 30, 2011, the Buyer shall provide a report to the Sellers'
Representative regarding all payments made in respect of 2010 Employee
Bonuses.

  

  

(c) Immediately following the Closing, the Company shall send to all Option
Holders a written communication under the Option Plan, pursuant to which each
Option Holder will be notified that (i) his or her unvested options will be
cancelled for a cash payment equal to the Fully Diluted Per-Share Price,
multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of such options,
less the aggregate exercise price of such options, if a positive number, and
discounted to reflect the time remaining until such options would have vested,
and (ii) in respect of their vested options, the Option Holder shall be
entitled to elect to require the Company to (A) cancel all (but not less than
all) of his or her options awarded under the Option Plan for an amount in cash
equal to (x) the Fully Diluted Per-Share Price, multiplied by the number of
shares issuable upon the exercise of such options, less (y) the aggregate
exercise price of such options, plus (z) his or her pro rata share of the Cash
Distribution, if a positive number, or (B) deem all (but not less than all) of
his or her options duly exercised, subject to payment of the aggregate
exercise price of such options and the entry into a Minority Purchase
Agreement, pursuant to which such Option Holder agrees to sell to the Buyer
all shares issuable upon the exercise of such options for an amount in cash
equal to the Per-Share Price, multiplied by such number of shares. The
Company's written communication shall require all Option Holders to make their
respective elections on or before the date that is three Business Days after
the Closing and, in the absence of any such election or the delivery of a duly
executed Minority Purchase Agreement with the Buyer within such period, such
Option Holder shall be deemed to have elected to require the Company to cancel
all his or her options as contemplated by Section 6.15(c)(ii)(A). The Company
and the Sellers hereby irrevocably direct and shall cause LaBarge Weinstein to
pay or arrange to pay, no later than the second Business Day following the
expiration of such three Business Day period, to such Option Holders, all
amounts due in respect of the cancellation of all options awarded under the
Option Plan (provided, however, that to the extent that such amounts are not
paid through the Company's payroll service, LaBarge Weinstein will provide the
Company with all information regarding such payments as the Company may
reasonably request). In the event that less than the entire Option Retirement
Amount is required for the retirement of the Options (as a result of the
exercise of Options by some Option Holders and the resulting reduction in the
proceeds payable to them), the balance of the Option Retirement Amount shall
be retained by the Sellers' Representative or his nominee to be used on
account of, or distributed to, the Sellers.

  

  

Section 6.16 Guaranty of Parent. (a) The Parent hereby irrevocably, absolutely
and unconditionally guarantees to the Sellers the prompt, complete and full
performance, when due, of all of the Buyer's covenants and obligations under
this Agreement and the Ancillary

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

Agreements, including the Buyer's obligation to make and deliver the Purchase
Price and the Closing Adjustment Amount, if any, to the Sellers and the
Buyer's indemnification obligations in accordance with Article VIII, when the
same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. This guaranty shall be a continuing guaranty and shall remain in
full force and effect until, and Parent's Liability under this guaranty shall
terminate upon, the termination of all of the Buyer's covenants and
obligations pursuant to, and in accordance with, this Agreement. The Parent
acknowledges that its obligations under this Section shall not be released or
discharged in whole or in part by the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation,
termination, dissolution, merger, consolidation or other business combination
of the Buyer. The guaranty contemplated in this Section 6.16 shall apply to
any obligation of the Buyer hereunder, regardless of whether the Parent is
specifically cited herein as being a party to such obligation. The Parent
shall be liable as principal debtor and not solely as surety with respect to
the performance of the obligations guaranteed hereunder. The Sellers shall not
be bound to exhaust their recourse against the Buyer or any other Person
before being entitled to payment or other recourse under the guarantee
provided by the Parent herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Parent shall promptly after Closing take all actions required
of it, and cause its Affiliates to take all such actions required of them, to
give effect to the terms of the Mutual Release, including the actions required
in Section 3.1(e) thereof.

  

  

(b) The Parent represents and warrants to the Sellers as of the date hereof
and as of the Closing Date: (i) it is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation and has full corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and
to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, (ii) the execution,
delivery and performance by the Parent of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party has been duly and validly authorized by the
Buyer and the Parent and no additional corporate, shareholder or other similar
authorization or consent is required in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by the Parent of this Agreement, and (iii) this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, when executed
and delivered by the Company and the Sellers, will constitute a valid and
legally binding obligation of the Parent enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, except insofar as (A) enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other applicable Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and (B) the availability of equitable
remedies such as specific performance and injunction may be limited by
applicable Law and the discretion that a court may exercise in granting the
same.

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES

  

  

Section 8.1 Survival. The representations and warranties of the Sellers, the
Company and the Buyer contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
for the applicable period set forth in this Section or as expressly provided
in Schedule G. All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
and all claims with respect thereto shall terminate upon the expiration of

Sections 5.1 (Organization of Buyer), 5.2 (Authorization) and 5.5 (Binding
Effect) shall survive forever (the representations and warranties referred to
in this clause (iii) being referred to herein as the "Longer Surviving
Representations"); it being understood that, if any Claim Notice has been
properly given (as provided in Section 10.2) within the applicable survival
period, the representations and warranties that are the subject of such
indemnification claim shall survive with respect to such claim until such time
as such claim becomes the subject of a Final Determination.

  

  

Section 8.2 Indemnification by the Sellers. (a) Subject to the provisions of
this Article VIII (including the provisions of Sections 8.2(b) and 8.7), each
of the Sellers severally, and not jointly nor jointly and severally, hereby
agrees, from and after the Closing, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Buyer, its Affiliates (including, post-Closing, the Transferred Companies) and
their respective Representatives and their heirs, successors and permitted
assigns, each in its capacity as such (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties,"
collectively with the Seller Indemnified Parties, the "Indemnified Parties")
from, against and in respect of any damages, losses, charges, obligations,
Liabilities, claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, payments,
judgments, settlements, assessments, deficiencies, Taxes (without duplication,
in the event that a claim for Taxes arises under both Sections 4.9 and
6.4(a)), royalties, fines, interest, penalties and reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants,
consultants and other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred in the
investigation, preparation, defense, settlement and ongoing monitoring of any
of the same or in asserting, preserving or enforcing rights under this
Agreement) (collectively, "Losses") imposed on, sustained, incurred or
suffered by, any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, whether in respect of
third-party claims, claims among the Buyer and the Sellers, or otherwise,
directly or indirectly, relating to or arising out of or resulting from (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty made by such Seller or the
Company contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; it being
understood that, for purposes of Section 8.2(a)(i), any qualifications
relating to materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" contained in such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded for purposes of determining
whether such representation or warranty was breached, (ii) any breach,
violation or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement of such Seller or
the Company contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (including
as to the payment, or setting aside of cash for payment, of Taxes for which
the Sellers are responsible in accordance with Section 6.4(a)), or (iii) any
action taken or not taken by the Sellers' Representative or his nominee
(including any failure to distribute, or error in the distribution of, the
aggregate

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

purchase price payable by Buyer under this Agreement and the Minority Purchase
Agreements to the Sellers and the Minority Shareholders, whether such
distribution is made by Sellers' Representative or by LaBarge Weinstein or
another nominee) or any action taken or not taken by the Buyer in reliance
upon the actions taken or not taken or communications or writings given or
executed by the Sellers' Representative pursuant to Section 10.11(b). For
greater certainty, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Seller
shall be liable to the Buyer for any breach by another Seller of any of the
Individual Representations of such other Seller or for such Seller's Willful
Misconduct or for the breach of any covenant of another Seller.

  

  

(b) The Sellers shall not be liable to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
under Section 8.2(a)(i) for Losses arising from breaches of the several
representations and warranties of the Company and the Sellers under Article IV
hereof (the "Company Representations") unless and until:

  

  

(i) in the case of the Company Representations other than (x) the Company
Representations in Sections 4.7 (Financial Statements), 4.13 (Intellectual
Property) and 4.29 (Disclosure), which are the subject to Section 8.2(b)(ii),
and (y) the Company Representations in Sections 4.22(b) (Absence of
Indebtedness) and 4.9 (Taxes), which shall not be subject to the following
limitations, (A) each individual Loss exceeds the De Minimis, all such
individual Losses being disregarded in calculating the Aggregate Indemnity
Threshold or Basket; provided, however, that, if all such individual Losses
that do not exceed the De Minimis in the aggregate equal or exceed the De
Minimis Basket, then all such individual Losses and any others shall be
included in calculating the Aggregate Indemnity Threshold or Basket, and (B)
the aggregate amount of all such Losses included pursuant to clause (A)
exceeds the applicable Aggregate Indemnity Threshold, in which case the
Sellers shall be liable only for such Losses as are in excess of the Basket,
all Losses below the Basket being for the account of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties; and

  

  

(ii) in the case of the Company Representations in each of (x) Section 4.7
(Financial Statements), (y) Section 4.13 (Intellectual Property) and (z)
Section 4.29 (Disclosure), (A) each individual Loss exceeds the De Minimis,
all such individual Losses being disregarded in calculating the Aggregate
Indemnity Threshold or Basket; provided, however, that, if all such individual
Losses that do not exceed the De Minimis in the aggregate equal or exceed the
De Minimis Basket, then all such individual Losses and any others shall be
included in calculating the Aggregate Indemnity Threshold or Basket, and (B)
the aggregate amount of all such Losses included in the calculation pursuant
to clause (A) and arising from breaches of the representations and warranties
under the applicable Section exceeds its applicable Aggregate Indemnity
Threshold, in which case the Sellers shall be liable under such Section only
for such Losses as are in excess of such Aggregate Indemnity Threshold, all
Losses below the Aggregate Indemnity Threshold being for the account of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties.

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, Losses resulting from the breach by a Seller of
any of its Individual Representations (which are contained in Article III)
shall not be included in calculating any Aggregate Indemnity Threshold or
Basket. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in
the case of Willful Misconduct (as set forth in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 8.12), breach of the representations and warranties in Section 4.22(b)
(Absence of Indebtedness) (it being understood that Losses resulting from a
breach of the representations and warranties in Section 4.22(b) shall be borne
by the Sellers in their respective Proportionate Amounts), breach of the
covenants of the Company contained in Section 6.14, or as expressly provided
in Schedule G, (A) the Sellers shall not have any liability or obligation to
the Buyer Indemnified Parties, pursuant to the indemnification provisions of
this Article VIII, or otherwise to the Buyer under this Agreement, for any
Losses in excess of an amount equal to the Aggregate Indemnity Cap, and (B)
the liability of each Seller for Losses under this Agreement (including for
Losses arising from breach of the covenants in Section 6.4(a)) shall not
exceed, in respect of any Losses, Seller's Proportionate Amount of the
aggregate amount of such Losses up to the Seller's Proportionate Amount of the
Aggregate Indemnity Cap. For the purposes hereof, "Proportionate Amount"
means, with respect to a Seller, (x) in the event of any Losses for which
payment is made to Buyer from the Escrow Amount, the percentage set forth
opposite the name of such Seller in Section 8.2(a)(x) of the Disclosure
Schedule and (y) in the event of any other Losses or for any other purpose
under this Agreement, the percentage set forth opposite the name of such
Seller in Section 8.2(a)(y) of the Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the provisions of
Sections 8.2(b)(A) and (B) shall not limit the liability of any Seller
hereunder for such Seller's Willful Misconduct, breach of such Seller's
Individual Representations, breach by such Seller of the representations and
warranties in Section 4.22(b) (Absence of Indebtedness), breach by such Seller
of its covenants contained in Section 6.14 or breach by such Seller of the
provisions of the Mutual Release.

  

  

(c) The Parties agree to the provisions with respect to indemnification and
other matters set forth in Schedule G. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 6.1, the Parties agree that the Mutual Litigation
Documents shall be removed from the premises and computer systems of the
Company prior to Closing such that they are not retained by the Company nor
received by the Buyer, the Parent or their respective Affiliates and as
otherwise provided in Schedule G.

  

  

Section 8.3 Indemnification by the Buyer. (a) Subject to the provisions of
this Article VIII, including the provisions of Section 8.3(b) and Section 8.7,
the Buyer hereby agrees, from and after the Closing, to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Sellers and their respective Representatives and their
heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in its capacity as such (the
"Seller Indemnified Parties") from, against and in respect of any Losses
imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted against, any of
the Seller Indemnified Parties, whether in respect of third-party claims,
claims among the Buyer and the Sellers, or otherwise, directly or indirectly
relating to, arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Buyer or the Parent contained in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement for the period such representation or
warranty survives, or (ii) any breach, violation or non-fulfillment of a
covenant or agreement of the Buyer or the Parent contained in this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement.

  

  

(b) The Buyer shall not be liable to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties
under Section 8.3(a)(i) for Losses unless and until the aggregate amount of
all such Losses exceeds the Aggregate Indemnity Threshold, in which case the
Buyer shall be liable only for such Losses as are in excess of the Basket, all
Losses below the Basket being for the account of the Seller Indemnified
Parties; provided, however, that the representations and warranties contained
in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

Sections 5.1 (Organization of Buyer), 5.2 (Authorization) and 5.5 (Binding
Effect) shall not be subject to such limitations. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer shall not have any liability or
obligation to the Seller Indemnified Parties, pursuant to the indemnification
provisions of this Article VIII, or otherwise to the Sellers under this
Agreement, for any Losses in excess of an amount equal to the Aggregate
Indemnity Cap, except in the cases of Willful Misconduct (as set forth in
Section 8.12), breach of the covenants of the Buyer and/or the Parent
contained in Sections 6.4(d), 6.14, 6.15, and 6.16 (but only to the extent the
applicable underlying obligation is uncapped), or breach of the provisions of
the Mutual Release.

  

  

Section 8.4 Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures. (a) If any written
claim or demand for which an indemnifying party (an "Indemnifying Party") may
have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder, is asserted against or
sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party, including
a Government Entity (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly (but no later than three Business Days after receipt thereof) notify
the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third-Party Claim (a "Third-Party
Claim Notice," collectively with Direct Claim Notices, "Claim Notices");
provided, however, that the failure timely to give a Third-Party Claim Notice
shall affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent
that such failure has a material prejudicial effect on the defenses or other
rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third-Party
Claim or the quantum of such Third-Party Claim (including all interest and
other penalties which may accrue as a result of such delay). A Third-Party
Claim Notice shall contain a brief summary of the facts underlying or relating
to such claim to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party and a copy of
any correspondence or notice received from the relevant third party and a
statement that the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification for Losses relating
to such Third-Party Claim.

  

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days (or, assuming no delay in the
delivery of the Third-Party Claim Notice by the Indemnified Party in breach of
this Agreement, such lesser number of days set forth in the Third-Party Claim
Notice as may be required by any Government Entity, court proceeding or
regulatory inquiry or investigation) after receipt of the Third-Party Claim
Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires
to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim unless the
Third Party Claim involves criminal liability; it being understood that, by
assuming the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
acknowledge its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to
all Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted against
the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third-Party Claim (subject only to
the limitations contained in this Article VIII and any amounts actually
recovered as contemplated by Section 8.8(a)). If an Indemnifying Party is
determined to have ultimately had an obligation to defend a Third-Party Claim,
then all Losses sustained, incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party in
defending such Third-Party Claim prior to the assumption of such defense by
the Indemnifying Party shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party, subject
to Section 8.4(a). If an Indemnifying Party is determined to not have
ultimately had an obligation to defend a Third-Party Claim, then all Losses
sustained, incurred or suffered by the Indemnifying Party in connection with
such defense after its assumption of such defense shall be reimbursed by the
Indemnified Party, subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement.

  

  

(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by
appropriate proceedings, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party that
is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense
of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to reasonably participate in any such defense; provided,
however, that such participation does not materially interfere with or
compromise such defense, including the opportunity to reasonably participate
in any discussions or correspondence with any Government Entity, and to employ
separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnified Party shall participate in
any such defense at its own expense unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and counsel to the
Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded, based on advice of legal
counsel, that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or
the availability to the Indemnified Party of one or more defenses or
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the Indemnifying Party in respect thereof, or (ii) the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim after the
Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue a Third-Party Claim it has
assumed, as provided in Section 8.4(d).

  

  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, (ii) is not entitled to
defend the Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 8.4(c) or (iii) after
assuming the defense of a Third-Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps
necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim within 10 Business Days
after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that
the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to assume its own defense; it being understood
that the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification for a Third-Party Claim
shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third-Party
Claim.

  

  

(e) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed defense of a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to the entry of judgment, admit any
liability with respect to, settle, compromise, discharge or offer to settle,
compromise or discharge any Third-Party Claim on a basis that would result in
(i) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would
restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Law, of a violation
of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
or that would have an adverse effect on other claims made or threatened
against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) any monetary
liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party or anything less than a complete release
being provided to the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates. The Indemnified
Party agrees to take all steps necessary to implement the settlement of any
Third Party Claim to which it has consented in accordance with this Section
8.4(e).

  

  

(f) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by
providing access during regular business hours to each other's relevant
business books, records and other documents, and employees; provided, however,
that such cooperation shall not unreasonably

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

interfere with the business or operations of the providing party to a greater
extent than as resulting from such litigation. All reasonable Losses
sustained, incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party in connection with
responding to, complying with or satisfying the Indemnifying Party's requests
for cooperation shall be promptly reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall use all reasonable
measures to minimize such Losses. If the Indemnifying Party disputes the
amount of, or otherwise refuses or fails to reimburse, any such Losses that
the Indemnified Party has incurred and for which the Indemnified Party has
sought reimbursement from the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall
continue providing reasonable cooperation with respect to the defense of the
relevant Third-Party Claim until such dispute has become the subject of a
Final Determination after which point the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party may resolve the dispute regarding any reimbursable Losses
that have not been paid by the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 8.5.

  

  

(g) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

  

  

Section 8.5 Direct Claims. (a) If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim
for indemnification hereunder for Losses that do not result from a Third-Party
Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying
Party in writing of such Direct Claim (a "Direct Claim Notice"), including a
brief summary of the facts underlying or related to such claim to the extent
then known by the Indemnified Party and a statement that the Indemnified Party
seeks indemnification for Losses relating to such claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall have a period of 30 days within which to investigate and respond
to such Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with
such investigation and response.

  

  

(b) If the Indemnifying Party accepts a Direct Claim or does not respond
within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
accepted the Direct Claim and to have conclusively acknowledged its obligation
to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to all Losses imposed on,
sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted against the Indemnified Party
in respect of such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party accepts or is
deemed to accept the Direct Claim within 30 days after the date of such
acceptance, it shall pay (or, if the Indemnifying Party is the Sellers, the
Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay) the amount of
Losses (if any) specified in the Direct Claim Notice for which the
Indemnifying Party has accepted indemnification at that time (which amount
shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Direct Claim).

  

  

(c) If the Indemnifying Party rejects all or any part of the Direct Claim or
does not respond within the 30-day period after the date of the Direct Claim
Notice, or any Losses are not paid in accordance with Section 8.5(b), the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to
resolve such dispute on the Direct Claim during the 30-day period following
the delivery of a response reflecting such dispute or the expiry of the 30-day
notice period, as the case may be. If the dispute is not resolved within such
30-day period, the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to seek
enforcement of its indemnification right under this Article VIII in accordance
with Section 10.9.

  

  

Section 8.6 Claim Notices. A Claim Notice shall state the estimated amount of
Losses (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such
claim) that the Indemnified Party believes it has sustained, incurred or
suffered with respect to any Third-Party Claim or Direct Claim and identify
the representations and warranties of the Indemnifying Party that the
Indemnified Party believes were breached or otherwise identify the bases upon
which the Indemnified Party believes that it is entitled to indemnification
(which bases shall not be conclusive of the final determination of liability
for indemnification).

  

  

Section 8.7 Incidental and Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that Losses shall not include any incidental, consequential, punitive, special
and indirect damages, including any lost profits or diminution of value.

  

  

Section 8.8 Adjustments to Losses. (a) Insurance. In calculating the amount of
any Losses, the proceeds actually received by an Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates under any insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery,
settlement or payment by or against any other Person in each case relating to
the Third-Party Claim or the Direct Claim, net of any actual costs, expenses
or premium increases incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such
proceeds, shall be deducted from such Losses. The Indemnified Parties and
their Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assert any
rights or make any claim or demand under any insurance policy relating to any
Third-Party Claim or Direct Claim or any occurrence, claim or Losses that
results in or would reasonably be expected to result in a payment by or on
behalf of an Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII. The Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to be subrogated to any rights of an Indemnified
Party. Upon request, the Indemnified Parties shall provide the Indemnifying
Party with copies of all of the Indemnified Parties' and their Affiliates'
insurance policies.

  

  

(b) Taxes. In calculating the amount of any Losses, any tax benefits which are
realized by an Indemnified Party relating to such Losses (other than such tax
benefits to the Company as are entitled to be received by, and are remitted
to, the Sellers hereunder) shall be deducted from such Losses.

  

  

(c) Purchase Price Adjustment. In calculating the amount of any Losses for
which any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder,
the amount of any reserve or other negative provision reflected in the Closing
Date Working Capital Statement related to such Losses shall be deducted and,
in the event that such amount or negative provision is greater than the amount
of the Losses, any other Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party under any
provision of this agreement shall be reduced by such excess.

  

  

(d) Reimbursement. If an Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates recovers
an amount from a third party in respect of Losses that are the subject of
indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Losses have been paid
by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party (or, if the Indemnifying Party
is the Sellers, and if the escrow is still in effect, the Escrow Agent) the

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of
such Losses (or, if the Sellers are the Indemnifying Party, any amount paid by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement), plus the amount actually
received from the third party in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount of
Losses.

  

  

Section 8.9 Payments. The Indemnifying Party shall pay (or, if the
Indemnifying Party is the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative shall instruct
the Escrow Agent to pay) all amounts payable pursuant to this Article VIII by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, promptly following receipt from
an Indemnified Party of a bill, together with all accompanying reasonably
detailed back-up documentation, for Losses that are the subject of
indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith
disputes the Losses, in which event it shall so notify the Indemnified Party.
In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay (or, if the Indemnifying Party
is the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
pay) to the Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the amount of any Losses for which it is liable hereunder no later than
five Business Days following any Final Determination of such Losses and the
Indemnifying Party's liability therefor. A "Final Determination" shall exist
when (i) the parties to the dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (ii)
a Government Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final and
binding order or judgment, or (iii) an arbitration or like panel shall have
rendered a final and binding determination or award with respect to disputes
the parties have agreed to submit thereto.

  

  

Section 8.10 Characterization of Indemnification Payments. To the extent
allowed under applicable Law, all payments made by or on behalf of an
Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant to
Section 8.2 (including Schedule G) or 8.3 hereof shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

  

  

Section 8.11 Effect of Waiver of Condition. Neither the Buyer's nor the
Sellers' right to indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII shall be adversely
affected by its waiver of a condition to Closing set forth in Article VII,
unless such party makes clear by the terms of its waiver that it is
foreclosing its right to indemnity with respect to the matter that is the
subject of the waiver.

  

  

Section 8.12 Exclusive Remedy. (a) The remedies expressly provided in this
Article VIII shall constitute the sole and exclusive basis for and means of
recourse of the Buyer and the Sellers and their respective Indemnified Parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, provided that any Losses
arising out of or resulting from fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement with the intent to avoid the
obligations under this Agreement (including the post-closing obligations
contained in Sections 6.4(d), 6.14, 6.15, and 6.16, and the provisions of the
Mutual Release), in each case by any Seller, the Company or the Buyer, as the
case may be, or its Indemnified Parties (collectively, "Willful Misconduct"),
shall be subject to Section 8.12(b).

  

  

(b) (i) Losses resulting from Willful Misconduct of the Transferred Companies
shall not be subject to any limitations on amounts pursuant to Section 8.2
(including Schedule G) or time pursuant to Section 8.1 and, notwithstanding
Section 8.15, the Buyer shall be entitled to recover such Losses from the
Sellers in their respective Proportionate Amounts in the event that the Escrow
Amount is fully depleted and (ii) Losses resulting from Willful Misconduct of
a Seller shall not be subject to any limitations on amounts or time and,
notwithstanding Section 8.15, the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

Buyer shall be entitled to recover such Losses from the applicable Seller in
the event that such Seller's Proportionate Amount of the Escrow Amount is
fully depleted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
indemnification provisions of this Article VIII may not be relied upon by any
Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses that are shown in a Final
Determination to have resulted from the Willful Misconduct of that Indemnified
Party.

  

  

Section 8.13 One Recovery. Any Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to
double recovery for any Losses even though they may have resulted from the
breach of more than one of the representations, warranties, agreements and
covenants made by the Indemnifying Party in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.14 Duty to Mitigate. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way
restrict or limit the general obligation at Law of an Indemnified Party to
mitigate any Losses which it may suffer or incur by reason of the breach by an
Indemnifying Party of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant of
the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement.

  

  

Section 8.15 Limit of Claims to Escrow Amount. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Article VIII and except in the event of Willful Misconduct,
Uncapped Losses and breaches of a Longer Surviving Representation, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive recourse to recover any amounts due
pursuant to Article VIII shall be solely to the Escrow Amount. In the event of
Willful Misconduct, an Uncapped Loss or a breach of a Longer Surviving
Representation, the Buyer shall first seek to recover the related Losses from
the Escrow Amount and, only to the extent that the Escrow Amount has been paid
to Sellers and the amount withheld under the Escrow Agreement is insufficient
to cover such Losses, then from the Sellers or the applicable Seller, as the
case may be.

  

  

ARTICLE IX

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

  

  

(a) by written agreement of the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative;

  

  

(b) by either the Buyer or the Sellers, by giving written notice of such
termination to the Sellers' Representative (in the case of the Buyer) or to
the Buyer (in the case of the Sellers), if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or prior to December 15, 2010 (the "Termination Date") so long as the
terminating party is not in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement;

  

  

(c) by the Buyer, by giving five days' written notice of such termination to
the Sellers' Representative, so long as the Buyer is not in material breach of
its obligations under this Agreement, if any condition set forth in Section
7.1 or Section 7.2 (other than in respect of Section 7.2(a)) shall have become
incapable of satisfaction on or prior to the Termination Date;

  

  

(d) by the Sellers, by giving five days' written notice of such termination to
the Buyer, so long as the Sellers are not in material breach of their
obligations under this Agreement, if any condition set forth in Section 7.1 or
Section 7.3 (other than in respect of Section 7.3(a)) shall have become
incapable of satisfaction on or prior to the Termination Date; or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) by either the Buyer or the Sellers, by giving written notice of such
termination to the Sellers' Representative (in the case of the Buyer) or to
the Buyer (in the case of the Sellers), if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or prior to the 10th Business Day following the satisfaction of all the
conditions set forth in Article VI as a result of any action or inaction by
the Sellers or the Buyer, as the case may be, in breach of its obligations
under this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.2 Liquidated Damages. In the event that the Buyer or the Sellers
shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c), (d) or (e),
as applicable, as a result of the material breach by any of the Sellers or the
Company, on the one hand or the Buyer, on the other hand, of its or their
obligations under this Agreement, then the Company or the Buyer, as the case
may be, shall pay to the terminating party or parties an aggregate fee in
Canadian Dollars equal to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price (the "Break
Fee") by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than five
Business Days after such termination. Each of the Parties acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby and that, without such agreements, the other
Parties would not enter into this Agreement. The Parties agree, on behalf of
themselves and their respective Affiliates, that (a) any payment required to
be made pursuant to this Section shall be in full satisfaction of any claims
hereunder relating to such termination, shall represent liquidated damages and
not a penalty and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers or the
Buyer, as the case may be, and their Affiliates against any other Party for
any Losses suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby to be consummated; provided, however, that any such
payment shall not relieve a Party from liability for any additional Losses
suffered by the Company or the Buyer, as the case may be, as a result of any
Willful Misconduct by such Party; and (b) except as provided in the proviso to
clause (a) of this Section, upon payment of the Break Fee in accordance
herewith, no Party, nor any of its Affiliates, shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that the Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall fail to pay the Break
Fee when due, such fee shall accrue interest for the period commencing on the
date such fee became past due, at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 200 basis points,
and in such event such Party shall also pay all costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by the terminating party or parties in connection
with efforts to collect the Break Fee.

  

  

ARTICLE X

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

Section 10.1 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not to
be performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 10.10. Each of the Parties hereby waives (i) any defenses in any such
action, suit or proceeding for an injunction or specific performance,
including the defense that a remedy at law

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any law to post a bond or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If, prior to
the Termination Date, any Party institutes an action, suit or proceeding to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any
other Party, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the
amount of time during which such action, suit or proceeding is pending, plus
20 Business Days or (ii) such other time period established by the New York
Court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding.

  

  

Section 10.2 Notices. All notices and communications required or permitted to
be given hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given and made if in
writing and if served by personal delivery upon the Party for whom it is
intended or delivered by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, or if sent by facsimile or email; provided, however, that the
facsimile or email is promptly confirmed by telephone confirmation thereof, to

Section 10.3 Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived by an instrument in writing signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Buyer and Sellers' Representative, or in the case of a waiver, by the
Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by a
Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

  

  

Section 10.4 No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. Subject to the
provisions of Sections 2.9 and 2.10, no Party to this Agreement may assign any
of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the Buyer
(in the case of the Sellers) or the Sellers' Representative (in the case of
the Buyer). Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Person other than the Buyer, the Sellers, the Indemnified
Parties and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted
assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Annexes,
Schedules and Exhibits hereto) and the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or
written, with respect to such matters (including the letter of intent between
the Company and the Buyer dated as of November 9, 2010), except for the
Confidentiality Agreements, which shall remain in full force and effect until
the Closing.

  

  

Section 10.6 Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of a Party to any
other Party under this Agreement, or any of the Ancillary Agreements, which
obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of
such Party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by
such Party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 10.7 Public Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, except as may be required to comply with the requirements of
any applicable Law and the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon
which the securities of a Party are listed ("Required Disclosure"), together
with any press release containing no information beyond that included in the
Required Disclosure, from and after the date hereof, no press release or
similar public announcement or communication shall be made or caused to be
made relating to this Agreement unless specifically approved in advance by the
Buyer and the Sellers' Representative.

  

  

Section 10.8 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the Party incurring
such costs and expenses; provided, however, that all such costs and expenses
incurred by the Sellers prior to the Closing shall be borne by the Company.

  

  

Section 10.9 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO and the federal laws of
Canada applicable therein, including with respect to the awarding and fixing
of costs as between parties in the event of a dispute, without regard to any
conflict of laws provisions.

  

  

Section 10.10 Jurisdiction and Venue. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York or any New York court sitting in the City of New
York (the "Chosen Courts") for the purposes of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or out of
the transactions contemplated hereby; it being understood that, with respect
to the Escrow Agreement, this provision shall only apply to the extent that
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Escrow
Agreement or out of the transactions contemplated thereby relates to a dispute
between or among one or more of the parties hereto (and not between a party
hereto and the Escrow Agent). Each Party agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by personal delivery, by registered mail, or by a
recognized international express delivery service to such Party's respective
address set forth in Section 10.1 (as such address may be changed by notice
delivered pursuant to such Section) shall be effective service of process for
any action, suit or proceeding in the applicable Chosen Court with respect to
any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this Section. Each
Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of
venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the applicable Chosen Court, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

  

  

Section 10.11 Sellers' Representative. (a) Each of the Parties agrees and
acknowledges that Joseph Abdul-Nour (and any successor appointed to act on his
behalf in accordance with Section 10.11(c)) is hereby appointed, authorized
and empowered to act as the sole and exclusive representative of the Sellers
(the "Sellers' Representative"), and as each Seller's true and lawful

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

attorney and agent, with full power of substitution, to do in the name of and
on behalf of such Seller anything that such Seller may lawfully do in
connection with the matters contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (other than in respect of a breach or alleged breach of any
Individual Representations and/or individual covenants of such Seller), and
the Sellers' Representative has duly accepted such appointment. The Sellers
hereby agrees that they shall be bound by any and all actions taken on their
behalf by the Sellers' Representative. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Sellers' Representative is hereby authorized and empowered to bind each of the
Sellers to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, and the Sellers
hereby agree that, upon execution of the execution of the Escrow Agreement by
the Sellers' Representative, each of the Sellers shall be bound by the terms
and conditions contained therein.

  

  

(b) The Buyer shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any communications or
writings given or executed by the Sellers' Representative in respect of any
matter described herein for which the Sellers' Representative is authorized to
act on behalf of the Sellers and the Buyer (and, where applicable, Joseph
Abdul-Nour) shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any action taken
or not taken in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or communications
or writings given or executed by the Sellers' Representative. The Buyer shall
be entitled to disregard any notices or communications given or made by any
Seller unless given or made through the Sellers' Representative; provided,
however, that the Buyer shall promptly forward a copy thereof to the Sellers'
Representative.

  

  

(c) In the event of the death of the Sellers' Representative or his inability
or unwillingness to perform his functions hereunder, the Sellers shall jointly
inform the Buyer in writing of a substitute representative. The Sellers'
Representative may be removed and replaced by the Sellers jointly by notice in
writing to the Buyer and the Sellers' Representative.

  

  

Section 10.12 Reorganization Parties. Each of the Reorganization Parties shall
be deemed to (a) give each of the representations and warranties given by its
related Reorganization Parties contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Agreement, jointly and severally with such other Reorganization Parties, (b)
make each of the covenants or agreements made by such other Reorganization
Parties contained in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, jointly and
severally with such other Reorganization Parties, and (c) be liable for any
breach of any such representation or warranty, any breach, violation or non-
fulfillment of any such covenant or agreement and as otherwise set forth in
Article VIII, jointly and severally with, and to the same extent as, such
other Reorganization Parties.

  

  

Section 10.13 Shareholders Agreement. Each of the Sellers hereby consents to
the termination of the Shareholders Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 thereof
effective upon the Closing and hereby agrees that, upon the completion of the
Closing, all of the terms and conditions of the Shareholders Agreement shall
be null and void and of no further force and effect. Further, each of the
Sellers agrees that any consent or approval required pursuant to the
Shareholders Agreement in order to complete the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Minority Purchase Agreements are hereby given and that any
restrictions on transfer of Shares contained in the Shareholders Agreement
shall not apply in respect of the purchase and sale of shares pursuant to this
Agreement or pursuant to the Minority Purchase Agreements and, for greater
certainty, each of the Sellers hereby agrees that the Right of First Offer
pursuant to Section 5.6(a) of the Shareholders Agreement shall not apply in
respect of the purchase and sale of shares pursuant to this Agreement or
pursuant to the Minority Purchase Agreements and such Seller hereby waivers
any right that he, she or it may, shall or does have to receive notice
thereof.

Section 10.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more

original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.15 Headings. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereof are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to

Section 10.16 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.
