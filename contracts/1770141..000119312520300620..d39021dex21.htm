(a) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive a number of shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ");

(b) each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company

13

    

(c) each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding

for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i)
the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration issuable to any Person
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_ shall be calculated on an aggregate basis
with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock held of record by such
Person immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) after such
aggregation, any fractional share of GigCapital2 Common Stock that would
otherwise be issuable to such Person following such aggregation shall be
rounded up to a whole share of GigCapital2 Common Stock.

 

SECTION 3.02 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. On the Closing Date, GigCapital2 shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company that shall be designated
by GigCapital2 and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this _Article III_ , the number of shares of
GigCapital2 Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (such shares of GigCapital2

as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). GigCapital2 shall cause the Exchange Agent
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to pay the Per Share
Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. Except as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.02(c)_, the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
GigCapital2 shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.01_: a letter of
transmittal, which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to GigCapital2
and the Company (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and shall specify (i) that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
evidencing such shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent
(each, a " _Transfer Agent Cancellation_ "); and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to the Letter of
Transmittal. Within two (2) Business Days (but in no event prior to the
Effective Time) after the surrender to the Exchange Agent of all Certificates
held by such holder for cancellation (or a Transfer Agent Cancellation),
together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificates shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefore, and GigCapital2 shall cause the
Exchange Agent to deliver, the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance
with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.01_, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_, each Certificate entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)_ shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Per Share Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)_.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of GigCapital2 Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the

such Certificate in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.02(b)_. Subject to the
effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any
such Certificate, GigCapital2 shall pay or cause to be paid to the holder of
the certificates representing shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock issued in
exchange therefore, without interest, (i) promptly, but in any event within
five (5) Business Days of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment
date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such shares of
GigCapital2 Common Stock.

 



14

    

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Per Share
Merger Consideration payable upon conversion of the Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid and issued
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.

 

(e) _Adjustments to Per Share Consideration_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to GigCapital2 Common Stock occurring on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
3.07_ hereto, any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of Company Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to GigCapital2, upon demand, and any holders of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_
shall thereafter look only to GigCapital2 for the Per Share Merger
Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed
by holders of Company Common Stock as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
government entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of GigCapital2 free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, GigCapital2 or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any such
Company Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.02_.

(h)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and GigCapital2
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to Person such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or GigCapital2, as the
case may be, and timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made (the " _Payee_ ") by the Surviving Corporation or
GigCapital2, as the case may be; provided, however, if Surviving Corporation
or GigCapital2, as the case may be, determines that an amount is required to
be deducted or withheld with respect to any amounts payable, at least two (2)
days prior to the Closing Date or other date the applicable payment is
scheduled to be made, other than with respect to any compensatory payments,
then it shall provide the applicable Payee with written notice of its intent
to deduct and withhold, and it shall reasonably cooperate with the such Payee
to eliminate or reduce the basis for such deduction or withholding (including
providing such Payee with a reasonable opportunity to provide forms or other
evidence that would exempt such amounts from withholding).

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per
Share Merger Consideration that such holder is otherwise entitled to receive
pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)_.

 

SECTION 3.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
representing Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or GigCapital2 for any reason shall be converted into the Per
Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)_.

 



15

    

SECTION 3.04 _Payment of Expenses_.

 

(a) No sooner than five (5) or later than two (2) Business Days prior to the

(b) No sooner than five (5) or later than two (2) Business Days prior to the

consultants, experts, financial advisors and other service providers engaged
by or on behalf of GigCapital2 or Merger Sub in connection with the

Expenses_ "). On the Closing Date following the Closing, GigCapital2 shall pay
or cause to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds all such
Outstanding GigCapital2 Transaction Expenses.

(c) GigCapital2 shall not pay or cause to be paid any Outstanding GigCapital2
Transaction Expenses or Outstanding Company Transaction Expenses other than in

SECTION 3.05 _Appraisal Rights_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the
extent available under the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
stockholders of the Company who shall have neither voted in favor of the
Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly
in writing appraisal for such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL and otherwise complied with all of the provisions of the DGCL
relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters rights (collectively,
the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, and such
stockholders shall have no right to receive, the Per Share Merger
Consideration, unless and until such stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws
or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL. Any stockholder of the Company who fails to perfect or who effectively
withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_, of the Certificate or Certificates that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give GigCapital2 (i) prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal received by the Company and any withdrawals of
such demands, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and

the Code. The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have performed, in all
respects, all obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in
any respect in default under or in violation of, and have no knowledge of any
default or violation in any respect by any party to, any Plan that

or advisory letter from the IRS with respect to the underlying preapproved

that would reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of
the qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust
by the IRS.

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, there has not been any non-exempt
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section

the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There have been no acts or omissions
by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates that have given or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material fines, penalties, taxes or
related charges on the Company or any Company Subsidiary under Sections 502
or 4071 of ERISA or Chapter 43 of the Code.

(i) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Plan have been timely made to the extent due or properly accrued on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
except as would not result in material liability to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
maintains, administers or has any liability (contingent or otherwise) with
respect to a defined benefit plan that is subject to Section 412 of the Code
or Title IV of ERISA or other applicable Law. Each Plan required to be funded

Code Section 4980D or 4980H or any other provision of the PPACA.

(l) Each Plan that constitutes a nonqualified deferred compensation plan

 merger notification requirements of the HSR Act, and filing and recordation
of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL and (ii) where the

or otherwise prevent GigCapital2 or Merger Sub from performing its material
obligations under this Agreement.

SECTION 5.07 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley_.

 

(a) GigCapital2 has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since June 5, 2019,
together with any amendments, restatements or supplements thereto
(collectively, the " _GigCapital2 SEC Reports_ "). GigCapital2 has heretofore
furnished to the Company true and correct copies of all amendments and
modifications that have not been filed by GigCapital2 with the SEC to all
agreements, documents and other instruments that previously had been filed by
GigCapital2 with the SEC and are currently in effect. As of their respective
dates, the GigCapital2 SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time
they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each director and executive officer of GigCapital2 has filed
with the SEC on a timely basis all documents required with respect to
GigCapital2 by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

 

(b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any notes
thereto) contained in the GigCapital2 SEC Reports was prepared in accordance
with GAAP (applied on a consistent basis) and Regulation S-X and Regulation
S-K, as applicable, throughout the periods indicated (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in
all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows of GigCapital2 as at the respective
dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to individually or in
the aggregate be material). GigCapital2 has no off-balance sheet arrangements
that are not disclosed in the GigCapital2 SEC Reports. No financial statements
other than those of GigCapital2 are required by GAAP to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of GigCapital2.

 

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth in the GigCapital2 SEC Reports,
neither GigCapital2 nor Merger Sub has any liability or obligation of a
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required to be
reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for
liabilities and obligations arising in the ordinary course of
GigCapital2s and Merger Subs business.

(d) GigCapital2 is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange.

 



38

    

(e) GigCapital2 has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to GigCapital2 and other material information required
to be disclosed by GigCapital2 in the reports and other documents that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of
the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to GigCapital2s principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting GigCapital2s principal executive officer and
principal financial officer to material information required to be included
in GigCapital2s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

(f) GigCapital2 maintains systems of internal control over financial
reporting that are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and
procedures sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that GigCapital2
maintains records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect, in
all material respects, its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board
of directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. GigCapital2 has delivered to the
Company a true and complete copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a
summary thereof) by any representative of GigCapital2 to GigCapital2s
independent auditors relating to any material weaknesses in internal controls
and any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
controls that would adversely affect the ability of GigCapital2 to record,
process, summarize and report financial data. GigCapital2 has no knowledge of
any fraud or whistle-blower allegations, whether or not material, that
involve management or other employees or consultants who have or had a
significant role in the internal control over financial reporting of
GigCapital2. Since June 5, 2019, there have been no material changes in
GigCapital2 internal control over financial reporting.

SECTION 5.13 _GigCapital2 Trust Fund_. As of the date of this Agreement,
GigCapital2 has no less than $174,272,398.21 in the trust fund established by
GigCapital2 for the benefit of its public stockholders (the " _Trust Fund_ ")
maintained in a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "
_Trust Account_ "). The monies of such Trust Account are invested in United
States Government securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, and held in trust by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the
" _Trustee_ ") pursuant to the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as
of June 10, 2019, between GigCapital2 and the Trustee (the " _Trust
Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and is
valid and in full force and effect and is enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Remedies Exceptions. GigCapital2 has complied in all
material respects with the terms of the Trust Agreement and is not in breach
thereof or default thereunder and there does not exist under the Trust
Agreement any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time,
would constitute such a breach or default by GigCapital2 or the Trustee.
There are no separate contracts, agreements, side letters or other
understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied): (i) between
GigCapital2 and the Trustee that would cause the description of the Trust
Agreement in the GigCapital2 SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material
respect; or (ii) to the knowledge of GigCapital2, that would entitle any
person (other than stockholders of GigCapital2 who shall have elected to
redeem their shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock pursuant to the GigCapital2
Organizational Documents) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account.
Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may
be released except: (A) to pay income and franchise taxes from any interest
income earned in the Trust Account; and (B) upon the exercise of Redemption
Rights in accordance with the provisions of the GigCapital2 Organizational
Documents. As of the date hereof, there are no Actions pending or, to the
knowledge of GigCapital2, threatened in writing with respect to the Trust
Account. Upon consummation of the Merger and notice thereof to the Trustee
pursuant to the Trust Agreement, GigCapital2 shall cause the Trustee to, and
the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to GigCapital2 as
promptly as practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with the Trust
Agreement at which point the Trust Account shall terminate;  _provided_ ,
_however_ that the liabilities and obligations of GigCapital2 due and owing or
incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due,
including all amounts payable (a) to stockholders of GigCapital2 who shall
have exercised their Redemption Rights, (b) with respect to filings,
applications and/or other actions taken pursuant to this Agreement required
under Law, (c) to the Trustee for fees and

Cloudbreak Merger (including fees owed by GigCapital2 to EarlyBirdCapital,
Northland Securities, Inc. and Odeon Capital Group LLC, pursuant to that
certain Business Combination Marketing Agreement, dated June 5, 2019, among
EarlyBirdCapital and GigCapital2). As of the date hereof, assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein and the
compliance by the Company with its respective obligations hereunder,

provide the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who remain

and welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee participates
subsequent to the Closing Date for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance, and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such

year. Following the Closing, Surviving Corporation will honor all accrued but

specified period, or level of compensation or benefits. Nothing contained in
this Agreement, express or implied, shall constitute an amendment or
modification of any employee benefit plan of the Company or shall require the
Company, GigCapital2, the Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries
to continue any Plan or other employee benefit arrangements, or prevent their
amendment, modification or termination.

modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior
to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or
agents of the Company, unless such modification shall be required by

of the bylaws or limited liability company agreements of the Company
Subsidiaries relating to indemnification, advancement or expense

to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or
agents of such Company Subsidiary, unless such modification shall be required
by applicable Law.

 

(b) On the Closing Date, GigCapital2 shall enter into customary
indemnification agreements reasonably satisfactory to each of the Company and
GigCapital2 with the Initial Post-Closing UpHealth Directors and the post-

acts, errors, or omissions for as long as it remains a public company. In
either case (i) or (ii), other than as set forth above, such coverage shall be

but in no case in an amount lower or coverage terms narrower than that
provided under the Companys and respective DandO insurance just prior to
Closing.

 

(d) On and after the Closing Date, for a period of no less than six years,
GigCapital2 shall, with regard to pre-Closing acts, errors, omissions of

and bylaws with provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,

None of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other

effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a

except for the Confidentiality Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned

to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by
such persons).

 

SECTION 10.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All legal actions and

themselves and with respect to their respective properties for the purpose of
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party

the courts described above in Delaware, other than Actions in any court of

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described herein for any reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Action in any such court is brought in an

to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each
of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section_ __ _ 10.07_.

 

SECTION 10.08 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission) in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

SECTION 10.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger)
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if that court does not
have jurisdiction, any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware without proof of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity as expressly
permitted in this Agreement. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a)
any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would
be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post security or a bond
as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

").

II.

 

The address of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of
Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, Corporation Trust Center, Wilmington, DE
19801, New Castle County. The name of the Corporations registered agent at
such address is The Corporation Trust Company.

III. 

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which a corporation may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (" _DGCL_ ").

IV.

 

The Corporation is authorized to issue only one class of stock, to be
designated Common Stock. The total number of shares of Common Stock presently
authorized is Ten Thousand (10,000) shares, with each share having a par value
of $0.0001.

V.

 

A. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the
Corporation shall be vested in its board of directors (" _Board of Directors_
"). The number of directors which shall constitute the whole board of
Directors shall be fixed by the Board of Directors in the manner provided in
the bylaws of the Corporation (" _Bylaws_ ").

B. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal
the Bylaws of the Corporation. The stockholders shall also have power to
adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in addition
to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the
Corporation required by law or by this Certificate of Incorporation, such
action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of

VI.

 

A. To the fullest extent permitted by law, a director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL or
any other law of the State of Delaware is amended to authorize corporate
action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors,
then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

   

B. Any repeal or modification of this  _Article_ __ _ VI_ shall be
prospective and shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director of the Corporation existing at the time of, or increase the liability
of any director with respect to any acts or omissions of such director

a certificate of designation (a " _Preferred Stock Designation_ ") filed
pursuant to the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly vested with the
authority to the full extent provided by law, now or hereafter, to adopt any

Section 4.3 _Common Stock._

 

(a) _Voting._

 

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and

annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the holders

election of directors and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote
of the stockholders of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except

(including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the shares of
Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate (including any amendment to any Preferred
Stock Designation) that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding
series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series of Preferred
Stock are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or
more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

(b) _Dividends._ Subject to applicable law, the rights, if any, of the

ARTICLE V

 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 

Section 5.1 _Board Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the
powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (as
they may be amended from time to time, " _Bylaws_ "), the Board is hereby
empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may
be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the
provisions of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, and any
Bylaws adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation; provided, however, that
no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall
invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such
Bylaws had not been adopted.

Section 5.2 _Number, Election and Term_.

 

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be
elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock voting
separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by
the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, the Board shall be divided into
three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I,
Class II, and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the
Board already in office to Class I, Class II, or Class III. The term of the
initial Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate, the term of the initial Class II Directors
shall expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate, and the term of the initial Class III directors shall expire at
the third annual meeting of the stockholders following the effectiveness of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each succeeding annual
meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning with the first
annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the
effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of the
successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term expires at
that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the
election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject
to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to _Section_ __ _
5.5_ hereof, if the number of directors that constitutes the Board is changed,
any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes
so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as
possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to
the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting
separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one
or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be
determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon.
The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions
thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid
classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (and
therefore such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

 

(c) Subject to _ Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office
until the next annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires
and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject,
however, to such directors earlier death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal.

 

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot. The holders of shares of
Common Stock shall not have cumulative voting rights.

 



3

    

Section 5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to _
Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, newly created directorships resulting from an
increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting
from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause
may be filled solely and exclusively by a majority vote of the remaining
directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining
director (and not by stockholders), and any director so chosen shall hold
office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors to which
the new directorship was added or in which the vacancy occurred and until his
or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to
such directors earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

 

Section 5.4 _Removal_. Subject to _ Section_ __ _ 5.5_ hereof, any or
all of the directors may be removed from office, but only for cause, by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, at
a meeting called for that purpose.

Section 5.5 _Preferred Stock Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _ Article_ __ _ V_, and except as otherwise required by
law, whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall
have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from
office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms
of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such
directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to this
_ Article_ __ _ V_ unless expressly provided by such terms.

ARTICLE VI

 

BYLAWS

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend,
alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total
number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at
which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may
be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders of the
Corporation; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or
by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority
of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders of the
Corporation to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided
further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the
Corporation shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been
valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted. 

ARTICLE VII

 

SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

 

Section 7.1 _Special Meetings_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the
holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the
requirements of applicable law, special meetings of stockholders of the
Corporation may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer of the Corporation, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by
a majority of the Board, and the ability of the stockholders of the
Corporation to call a special meeting is hereby specifically denied. Except as
provided in the foregoing sentence, special meetings of stockholders of
the Corporation may not be called by another person or persons.

Section 7.2 _Advance Notice_. Advance notice of stockholder nominations
for the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders
before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in
the manner provided in the Bylaws.

 

Section 7.3 _Action by Written Consent_. Except as may be otherwise
provided for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights
of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action
required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must
be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders
and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders of the
Corporation.

ARTICLE VIII

 

LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 8.1 _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the
Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is
not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended
unless a director violated his or her duty of loyalty to the Corporation or
its stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the
law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or
unlawful redemptions, or derived improper personal benefit from its actions as
a director. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the
Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

 

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (a " _proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is
or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or
officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit
entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an "
_indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in
connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent
not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, to
the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of
the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified under this _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or otherwise. The
rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this _
Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as
to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent
and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _ Section_
__ _ 8.2(a)_, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses
to an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by
the Board.

 

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any
other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_ by the
stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any
other provision of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent
with this _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be
prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits
the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a
retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way
diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of
such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect
of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened,
commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission
occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent
provision.

 



5

    

(d) This _ Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the
Corporation, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law,
to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY

 

Section 9.1 _Corporate Opportunities and_ __ _ Non-Employee_ __ _
Directors_.

 

(a) In recognition and anticipation that members of the Board who are not
employees of the Corporation (the "Non-Employee Directors") and their
respective Affiliates may now engage and may continue to engage in the same or
similar activities or related lines of business as those in which
the Corporation, directly or indirectly, may engage and/or other business
activities that overlap with or compete with those in which the Corporation,
directly or indirectly, may engage, the provisions of this __ _ Article IX_
are set forth to regulate and define the conduct of certain affairs of the
Corporation with respect to certain classes or categories of business
opportunities as they may involve any of the Non-Employee Directors or their
respective Affiliates and the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the
Corporation and its directors, officers and stockholders in
connection therewith. For purposes of this __ _ Article IX_, (i) "Affiliate"
shall mean, (a) in respect of each Non-Employee Director, any Person that,
directly or indirectly, is controlled by such Non-Employee Director (other
than the Corporation and any entity that is controlled by the Corporation) and
(b) in respect of the Corporation, any Person that, directly or indirectly,
is controlled by the Corporation; and (ii) "Person" shall mean any individual,
corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, trust, association or any other entity.

 

(b) No Non-Employee Director  (including any Non-Employee Director who
serves as an officer of the Corporation in both his or her director and
officer capacities) or his or her Affiliates (such Persons being referred to,
collectively, as "Identified Persons" and, individually, as an "Identified
Person") shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, have any duty to
refrain from directly or indirectly (1) engaging in the same or
similar business activities or lines of business in which the Corporation or
any of its Affiliates now engages or proposes to engage or (2) otherwise
competing with the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, and, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, no Identified Person shall be liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for
breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that such Identified
Person engages in any such activities. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in, or right
to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity which
may be a corporate opportunity for an Identified Person and the Corporation
or any of its Affiliates, except as provided in __ _ Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_
of this __ _ Article IX_. Subject to said __ _ Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_
of this __ _ Article IX_, in the event that any Identified Person acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity which may
be a corporate opportunity for itself, herself or himself and the Corporation
or any of its Affiliates, such Identified Person shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or
other business opportunity to the Corporation or any of its Affiliates and, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, shall not be liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any
fiduciary duty as a stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation solely
by reason of the fact that such Identified Person pursues or acquires such
corporate opportunity for itself, herself or himself, or offers or directs
such corporate opportunity to another Person.

 

(c) The Corporation does not renounce its interest in any corporate
opportunity offered to any Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee
Director who serves as an officer of this Corporation) if such opportunity is
expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director
or officer of the Corporation, and the provisions of __ _ Section_ __ _
9.1(b)_ of this __ _ Article IX_ shall not apply to any such corporate
opportunity. 

 



6

    

(d) In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this __
_ Article IX_, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be a potential
corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business opportunity that
(i) the Corporation is unable, financially or legally, or is
not contractually permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the
line of the Corporations business or is of no practical advantage to the
Corporation or (iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or
reasonable expectancy.

(e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, any Person purchasing or
otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of capital stock of the
Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the
provisions of this __ _ Article IX_.

 

(f) Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or repeal of this
_Article IX_ , nor the adoption of any provision of this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) inconsistent
with this _Article IX_ , shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this _Article
IX_ in respect of any corporate opportunity first identified or any other
matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this
_Article IX_ , would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment,
addition, repeal or adoption.

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

 

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend,
alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and other
provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in
force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed
by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as
set forth in __ _ Article_ __ _ VIII_, all rights, preferences and
privileges of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or
any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to
the right reserved in this __ _ Article_ __ _ X_.

 

ARTICLE XI

EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR CERTAIN LAWSUITS

Section 11.1 _Forum._ Unless the Corporation consents in writing to
the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including
a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought
on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of
a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any
action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or
employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim
against the Corporation, its directors, officers or employees governed by the
internal affairs doctrine and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder
bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on
such stockholders counsel except any action (A) as to which the Court of
Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable
party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the
indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is
vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court
of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject
matter jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this __
_ Section_ __ _ 11.1_ will not apply to suits brought to enforce any
liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which
the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the federal district courts of the United States of America, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, shall be the sole and exclusive forum for
the resolution of any action asserting a cause of action arising under the
Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in any security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice
of and consented to the provisions of this Section 11.1.

Section 11.2 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. If any action the subject matter
of which is within the scope of _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ immediately above is
filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a "
_Foreign Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be
deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any
action brought in any such court to enforce  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_
immediately above (an " _FSC Enforcement Action_ ") and (ii) having service of
process made upon such stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by
service upon such stockholders counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for
such stockholder.

time on or after the Effective Time, the Holders holding at least a majority
in interest of the then-outstanding number of Registrable Securities held by
all the Holders (such Holders, the "Demanding Holders"), may make a written
demand for Registration under the Securities Act of all or part of their
Registrable Securities, which written demand shall describe the amount and
type of securities to be included in such Registration and the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof (such written demand a "Demand
Registration"). The Company shall, within ten (10) days of the Companys
receipt of the Demand Registration, notify, in writing, all other Holders of
Registrable Securities of such demand, and each Holder of Registrable
Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or a portion of such Holders
Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration (each such Holder that
includes all or a portion of such Holders Registrable Securities in such
Registration, a "Requesting Holder") shall so notify the Company, in writing,
within five (5) days after the receipt by the Holder of the notice from the
Company. Upon receipt by the Company of any such written notification from a
Requesting Holder(s) to the Company, such Requesting Holder(s) shall be
entitled to have their Registrable Securities included in a Registration
pursuant to a Demand Registration and the Company shall effect, as soon
thereafter as practicable, but not more than forty five (45) days immediately
after the Companys receipt of the Demand Registration, the Registration of
all Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding Holders and Requesting
Holders pursuant to such Demand Registration. Under no circumstances shall the
Company be obligated to effect more than an aggregate of two (2)
Registrations pursuant to a Demand Registration under this _Section_ __ _
2.1.1_ initiated by Holders; _provided_ , that a Registration shall not be
counted for such purposes unless a Form S-1 or any similar long-form
registration statement that may be available at such time ("Form S-1") has
become effective and all of the Registrable Securities requested by the
Requesting Holders to be registered on behalf of the Requesting Holders in
such Form S-1 Registration have been sold, in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.1_ of this Agreement.

2.1.2 _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1.1_ above or any other part of this Agreement, a

Registration unless and until (i) a Form S-1 filed with the Commission in
connection with the Registration has been declared effective by the Commission
and (ii) the Company has complied with all of its obligations under this
Agreement with respect thereto; _provided_ , that if, after such Registration
Statement has been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities
pursuant to a Demand Registration is interfered with by any stop order or
injunction of the Commission or any other governmental agency or court,
the Registration Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be
deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop
order or injunction is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating such Demand
Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to continue with such Registration
and accordingly notify the Company in writing of such election, which notice
shall be received by the Company not later than five (5) days after the

2.1.3 _Underwritten Offering._ Subject to the provisions of  _Section_ __
_ 2.1.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ hereof, if a majority-in-interest of the
Demanding Holders so advise the Company as part of their Demand Registration
that the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant thereto shall be in the
form of an Underwritten Offering, then the right of such Demanding Holder or
Requesting Holder (if any) to include its Registrable Securities in such
Registration shall be conditioned upon such Holders participation in such
Underwritten Offering and the inclusion of such Holders Registrable
Securities in such Underwritten Offering to the extent provided herein. All
such Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this _Section_ __ _ 2.1.3_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
initiating the Demand Registration.

 

2.1.4 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing Underwriter(s)
for a Demand Registration that is to be an Underwritten Offering, in good
faith, advises the Company, the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders
in writing that the dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities which
the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell,
taken together with all other shares of Common Stock or other equity
securities which the Company desires to sell and the shares of Common Stock,
if any, as to which a Registration has been requested pursuant to separate
written contractual piggy-back registration rights held by other stockholders
of the Company who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or
maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the Underwritten
Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing,
the distribution method, or the probability of success of such Underwritten
Offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of securities, as
applicable, the "Maximum Number of Securities"), then the Company shall
include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable
Securities of the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) (pro
rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be included in
such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of Registrable
Securities that the Demanding Holders and Requesting Holders have requested
be included in such Underwritten Registration (such proportion is referred to
herein as "Pro Rata")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (i), the
Registrable Securities of Holders (Pro Rata, based on the respective number of
Registrable Securities that each Holder has so requested) exercising their
rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2.1_ hereof, without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (iii)
third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the Common Stock or other
equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (iv) fourth, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the Common Stock or other equity
securities of other persons or entities that the Company is obligated to
register in a Registration pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons and that can be sold without exceeding the

Section 2.2 Piggy-Back Registration.

 

2.2.1 _Piggy-Back Rights_. If, at any time on or after the Effective Time,
the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities
Act with respect to an offering of equity securities, or securities or other
obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, equity
securities, by the Company for its own account or for stockholders of the
Company for their account (or by the Company and by stockholders of the
Company including, without limitation, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_),
other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with any employee
stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of
securities solely to the Companys existing stockholders, (iii) for an
offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the Company,
or (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, then the Company shall (x) give
written notice of such proposed filing to the holders of Registrable
Securities as soon as practicable but in no event less than ten (10) days
before the anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe the amount

of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the holders of
Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to register the sale of
such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such holders may request in
writing within five (5) days following receipt of such notice (a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "). The Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable
Securities to be included in such Registration and shall use its best efforts
to cause the managing Underwriter(s) of a proposed Underwritten Offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the
Company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
All holders of Registrable Securities proposing to distribute their securities
through a Piggy-Back Registration that involves an Underwriter(s) shall
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
Underwriter(s) selected for such Piggyback Registration.

2.2.2 _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the
managing Underwriter(s) for a Piggyback Registration that is to be an
Underwritten Offering, in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing
that the dollar amount or number of securities which the Company desires to

any, as to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder, (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which

without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the

other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company shall

securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities, other than the
Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause (A), the
Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their
Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2.1_, Pro Rata based on

Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for
any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter(s) of his, her or its intention to withdraw from such
Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such Piggyback
Registration. The Company (whether on its own good faith determination or as
the result of a request for withdrawal by persons pursuant to separate
written contractual obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement filed
with the Commission in connection with a Piggyback Registration at any time
prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible
for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback
Registration prior to its withdrawal under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2.3. _

2.2.4 _Unlimited Piggyback Registration Rights_. For purposes of clarity,
any Registration effected pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ hereof shall not be
counted as a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration effected under
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_ hereof.

 

Section 2.3 Registration on Form S-3. The Holders of Registrable
Securities may at any time, and from time to time, request in writing that the
Company, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor rule
promulgated thereafter by the Commission), register the resale of any or all
of their Registrable Securities on Form S-3 or any similar short-form
registration statement that may be available at such time ("Form S-3");
_ provided_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to effect such request
through an Underwritten Offering. Within five (5) days of the Companys
receipt of a written request from a Holder or Holders of Registrable
Securities for a Registration on Form S-3, the Company shall promptly give
written notice of the proposed Registration on Form S-3 to all other Holders
of Registrable Securities, and each Holder of Registrable Securities who
thereafter wishes to include all or a portion of such Holders Registrable
Securities in such Registration on Form S-3 shall so notify the Company, in
writing, within ten (10) days after the receipt by the Holder of the notice
from the Company. As soon as practicable thereafter, but not more than twelve
(12) days after the Companys initial receipt of such written request for a
Registration on Form S-3, the Company shall register all or such portion of
such Holders Registrable Securities as are specified in such written request,
together with all or such portion of Registrable Securities of any other
Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in the written
notification given by such Holder or Holders; _provided_ , that the Company
shall not be obligated to effect any such Registration pursuant to _ Section_
__ _ 2.3_ hereof if (i) a Form S-3 is not available for such offering; or
(ii) the Holders of Registrable Securities, together with the Holders of any
other equity securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such
Registration, propose to sell the Registrable Securities and such other equity
securities (if any) at any aggregate price to the public of less than
$5,000,000. Registrations effected pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 2.3_
shall not be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.1_.

 

Section 2.4 Restrictions on Registration Rights. If (A) during the
period starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Companys good
faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred
and twenty (120) days after the effective date of, a Company initiated
Registration and provided that the Company has delivered written notice to
the Holders prior to receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.1.1_ and it continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable
efforts to cause the applicable Registration Statement to become effective;
(B) the Holders have requested an Underwritten Registration and the Company
and the Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to firmly
underwrite the offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment of the Board such
Registration would be seriously detrimental to the Company and the Board
concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall
furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board
stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be seriously
detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be filed in
the near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of
such Registration Statement. In such event, the Company shall have the right
to defer such filing for a period of not more than thirty (30) days;
_provided_ , that the Company may not defer its obligation in this manner
more than once in any 12-month period.

its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective and remain effective until all Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement have been sold;

 

3.1.2 prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-
effective amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to
the Prospectus, as may be reasonably requested by the Holders or any

regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by
the Company or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder to
keep the Registration Statement effective until all Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement are sold in accordance with the
intended plan of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or
supplement to the Prospectus;

3.1.3 prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the Underwriters,

Statement as proposed to be filed, each amendment and supplement to such
Registration Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein), the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement (including each preliminary Prospectus), and such
other documents as the Underwriters and the Holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration or the legal counsel for any such Holders may

owned by such Holders;

3.1.4 prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its best
efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the

distribution) may request and (ii) take such action necessary to cause such
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered
with or approved by such other governmental authorities as may be necessary by
virtue of the business and operations of the Company and do any and all other
acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the Holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to consummate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do
business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to
qualify or take any action to which it would be subject to general service of
process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then otherwise so
subject;

 

3.1.5 cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities
exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by
the Company are then listed;

3.1.6 provide a transfer agent or warrant agent, as applicable, and
registrar for all such Registrable Securities no later than the effective date

3.1.7 advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly after it

Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose
and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any
stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

 



8

thereof, of the time when such registration statement has been declared

reference into such Registration Statement or Prospectus, furnish a copy
thereof to each seller of such Registrable Securities or its counsel;

 

3.1.10 notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to such
Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
of the happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes a Misstatement, and
then to correct such Misstatement as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.4_
hereof;

3.1.11 permit a representative of the Holders (such representative to be
selected by a majority of the participating Holders), the Underwriters, if
any, and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders or Underwriter to
participate, at each such persons own expense, in the preparation of
the Registration Statement, and cause the Companys officers, directors and
employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with the
Registration;  _provided_ , that such representatives or Underwriters enter
into a confidentiality agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, prior to the release or disclosure of any such
information;

 

3.1.12 obtain a "comfort" letter from the Companys independent registered
public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Registration, in customary
form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "comfort"
letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably request, and may be found
reasonably satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the participating
Holders;

 

3.1.13 on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale
pursuant to such Registration, obtain an opinion, dated such date, of counsel
representing the Company for the purposes of such Registration, addressed to
the Holders, the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the Underwriters,
if any, covering such legal matters with respect to the Registration in

reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of the Company to
participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably
requested by the Underwriter in any Underwritten Offering; and

 

3.1.17 otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such
customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in
connection with such Registration.

 

Section 3.2 Registration Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein,
the Registration Expenses of all Registrations shall be borne by the Company.

selling expenses relating to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as

marketing costs and, other than as set forth in the definition of
"Registration Expenses," all reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
representing the Holders.

 



9

    

Section 3.3 Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings. No
person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of
the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company hereunder
unless such person or entity(i) agrees to sell such persons or entitys
securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
the Company and (ii) completes and executes all customary questionnaires,
powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements
and other customary documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of
such underwriting arrangements.

 

Section 3.4 Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure. Upon receipt of
written notice from the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus
contains a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities until such Holder has received copies of
a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being
understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplemented or amended Prospectus as soon as practicable after the time of
such notice), or until he, she or it is advised in writing by the Company
that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial
effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any
Registration at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for
reasons beyond the Companys control, the Company may, upon giving prompt
written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the
shortest period of time, but in no event more than thirty (30) days,
determined in good faith by the Company to be necessary for such purpose. In
the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the
Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice
referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any Registration
in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. The
Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of any period
during which it exercised its rights under this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, and
upon the expiration of such period the Holders shall be entitled to resume
the use of any such Prospectus in connection with any sale or offer to sell
Registrable Securities, and upon the expiration of such period the Holders
shall be entitled to resume the use of any such Prospectus in connection with
any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities.

 

Section 3.5 Reporting Obligations. As long as any Holder shall own
Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be reporting
under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in
respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports
required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant to
_Sections_ __ _ 13(a)_ or _15(d)_ of the Exchange Act and to promptly
furnish the Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings. The
Company further covenants that it shall take such further action as any
Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to
enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities held by such Holder without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor
rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal
opinions. Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such
Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it
has complied with such requirements.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

 

Section 4.1 Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to
indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, and hold harmless each Holder of
Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and each person who
controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) from and
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any of them, or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as
the same is contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company
by the Holder expressly for use therein. The Company also shall indemnify any
Underwriter of the Registrable Securities, their officers and directors and
each person who controls such Underwriter (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) on substantially the same basis as that of the
indemnification of the Holder provided in this _Section_ __ _ 4.1_.

 



10

    

Section 4.2 __ Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities. In
connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of Registrable
Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the Company in
writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests
for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and,
to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company, its directors and
officers and agents and each person who controls the Company (within
the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys
fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact contained in the
Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in
any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Holder expressly
for use therein; _provided_ , that the obligation to indemnify shall be
several, not joint and several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities,
and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in
proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the
sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. Each
Holder shall indemnify any Underwriter of Registrable Securities sold by such
Holder, their officers, directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent
as provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.

Section 4.3  Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. Any person entitled
to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification
(provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any
persons right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not
materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such
indemnified partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim,
permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is
not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be
obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim,
unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of
interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such
indemnified parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party shall,
without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all respects
by the payment of money (and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party
pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which settlement does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect
to such claim or litigation.

 

Section 4.4 Survival. The indemnification provided for under this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling
person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities.
The Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an
offering also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by
any indemnified party for contribution to such party in the event the
Companys or such Holders indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

Section 4.5 Contribution. If the indemnification provided under _Section_
__ _ 4.1_ hereof from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient
to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying
party, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in
question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, was made by, or
relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified
party, and the indemnifying partys and indemnified partys relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
action; _provided_ , that the liability of any Holder under this _Section_ __
_ 4.5_ shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such
Holder in such offering giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or
payable by a party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to
above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in
_Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ and _4.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ were
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

ARTICLE VI

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 6.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including _Schedule A_
hereto) constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the
parties as to the matters covered herein and supersedes and replaces any prior
understanding, agreement or statement of intent, in each case, written or
oral, of any and every nature with respect thereto.

Section 6.2 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or
permitted to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon
receipt when delivered by hand, (b) upon transmission, if sent by facsimile
or electronic transmission (in each case with receipt verified by electronic
confirmation), or (c) one (1) Business Day after being sent by courier or
express delivery service, specifying next day delivery, with proof of receipt.
The addresses, email addresses and facsimile numbers for such notices and
communications are those set forth on the signature pages hereof, or such
other address, email address or facsimile numbers as may be designated in
writing hereafter, in the same manner, by any such person.

Section 6.3 Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and
the rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be
assigned or delegated by the Company in whole or in part. This Agreement and
the rights, duties and obligations of the Holders hereunder may be freely
assigned or delegated by such Holder in conjunction with and to the extent of
any transfer of Common Stock by any such Holder. This Agreement and the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each
of the parties and the permitted assigns of the applicable Holder or of any
assignee of the applicable Holder. This Agreement is not intended to confer
any rights or benefits on any persons that are not party hereto other than as
expressly set forth in  _Article 4_ and this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. No
assignment by any party hereto of such partys rights, duties and obligations
hereunder shall be binding upon or obligate the Company unless and until the
Company shall have received (i) written notice of such assignment and (ii)
the written agreement of the assignee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, to be bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement (which
may be accomplished by an addendum or certificate of joinder to this
Agreement).

Section 6.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart and such counterparts may be
delivered by the parties hereto via facsimile or electronic transmission.

 

Section 6.5 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or modified,
and any provision hereof may be waived, in whole or in part, at any time
pursuant to an agreement in writing executed by the Company and Holders
holding a majority of the Registrable Securities at such time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or
waiver hereof that adversely affects one Holder, solely in his, her or its
capacity as a holder of the shares of capital stock of the Company, in a
manner that is materially different from the other Holders (in such capacity)
shall require the consent of the Holder so affected. Any failure by any party
at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be
construed a waiver of such provision or any other provisions hereof.

Section 6.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of
this Agreement or the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application
of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto.

 

Section 6.7 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by,
interpreted under, and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed within the
State of New York, without giving effect to any choice-of-law provisions
thereof that would compel the application of the substantive laws of any other
jurisdiction.

 



13

    

Section 6.8 Specific Performance. Each party acknowledges and agrees that
the other parties hereto would be irreparably harmed and would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed by such first party in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached by such first party. Accordingly,
each party agrees that the other parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such parties are entitled at law or in
equity.

SCHEDULE 7.06(C)

 

Thrasys Incentive Restricted Stock Units

 

1\. Following the Closing and the filing of a registration statement under
Form S-8 for the Equity Plan, each of the individuals listed in the tables
below shall, subject to the approval of the UpHealth Board, be issued the
number of restricted stock units of GigCapital2 under the Equity Plan as set
forth next to such individuals name in Section 2 below, subject to the
vesting restrictions set forth below; provided, that, an individuals right to
receive any restricted stock units shall be conditioned upon the receipt by
GigCapital2 of an agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to GigCapital2
pursuant to which such individual agrees to waive any right to receive any
stock options, restricted stock units or any other equity interests of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, GigCapital2 or any of the Company
Subsidiaries and agrees to release all claims against GigCapital2, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any
failure by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to issue stock
options, restricted stock units or other equity interests of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision
of this _Schedule 7.06(c)_ shall (a) create any third-party beneficiary or
other rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of GigCapital2, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, any
of their respective Affiliates or any other Person other than the parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (b)
constitute or create or be deemed to constitute or create an employment
agreement or (c) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any
employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by GigCapital2, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates. For the
avoidance of doubt, all grants shall be subject to the approval of the
UpHealth Board and any restrictions deemed appropriate or necessary by the
UpHealth Board. An individual shall be eligible to receive a grant only if he
or she is a service provider to GigCapital2, the Surviving Corporation or any
of the Company Subsidiaries as of the date of grant. All grants shall be
subject to the terms of the Equity Plan and the form of agreement thereunder.

2\. Subject to Section 1, following the Closing, GigCapital2 shall grant to
the individuals set forth below the number of restricted stock units of
GigCapital2 as set forth next to each such individuals name, which restricted
stock units shall vest into shares of GigCapital2 Common Stock at the earlier
of (i) the date that is one year after the Closing Date of the business
combination, (ii) the date on which the last sale price of the common stock
equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any
20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 90 days
after the Closing Date of the business combination, or (iii) the date on which
the Company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar
transaction that results in all of the Companys stockholders having the right
to exchange their shares of Common Stock for cash, securities or other
property. If an individual set forth below ceases to be a service provider to
GigCapital2, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Company Subsidiaries
prior to any vesting date, the unvested portion of the restricted stock units
shall be cancelled and surrendered to GigCapital2.

 

The Thrasys Incentive Amount that shall be eligible to be granted shall be (a)
32.016% multiplied by (b) 15.167% multiplied by (c) the Adjusted Aggregate
Merger/Incentive Amount.

The Adjusted Aggregate Merger/Incentive Amount shall be (a) the Aggregate
Merger Consideration Value divided by (b) $10.00.

remaining individuals.
