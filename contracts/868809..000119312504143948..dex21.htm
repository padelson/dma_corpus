CHEVRON U.S.A. INC., a Pennsylvania corporation with a mailing address of 1111
Bagby, Houston, Texas 77002 ("Seller") and XTO ENERGY INC., a Delaware
corporation with a mailing address of 810 Houston Street, Fort Worth, TX
76102-6298 ("Buyer").



_W I T N E S S E T H_ :



That Seller desires to sell to Buyer and Buyer desires to purchase from Seller
on the terms set forth in this Agreement those certain oil and gas interests
and associated assets described herein. Accordingly, in consideration of the
mutual promises contained herein, the mutual benefits to be derived by each
party hereunder and other good and valuable considerations, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Buyer and Seller agree as
follows:



1\. _Sale and Purchase of Assets_



1.1 _Assets to be Sold_. Seller shall sell, transfer, grant, and assign, or
cause others to sell, transfer, grant and assign and deliver to Buyer, and
Buyer shall purchase and receive all of Sellers undivided interests (but
exclusive of the equipment, machinery, and other real, personal, movable,
immovable and mixed property expressly reserved by Seller pursuant to Section
1.5 hereof) in and to the following:



 

(a) The oil, gas and mineral leases and/or deeds, operating rights, working
interests, mineral interests, royalty interests, overriding
royalty interests, payments out of production and other similar agreements
and rights, whether producing or non-producing, and any other oil, gas or
mineral rights or portions of same, representing Sellers ownership rights in
the Fields described in Exhibit "A" or identified as being included in this
transaction pursuant to Section 1.1 (g) below, and further including any
renewals, extensions, ratifications and amendments to such leases and/or deeds
or portions of same (collectively, the "Leases"), together with all oil and
gas unitization, pooling and/or communitization agreements, declarations,
designations and/or orders relating to the Leases and statutorily, judicially
or administratively created drilling, spacing and/or production units,
whether recorded or unrecorded, insofar as they relate to the Leases, and all
of Sellers interest in and to the properties covered or units created thereby
to the extent attributable to the Leases (collectively, the "Units"); but
reserving to Seller (i) all of Sellers rights, title and interests under
certain of said Leases to explore for and produce oil, gas and minerals
outside the surface boundaries of a Field described in Exhibit "A" or above
or below the depths associated with the specific Fields described in Exhibit
"A-1" (the "Retained Interests"), which Retained Interests shall be more
completely described in the detailed listing of the Assets to be conveyed
that will be delivered by Seller to Buyer after execution of this Agreement as
set forth in the final paragraph of this Section 1.1, and (ii) the right to
enter upon and use such portion or portions of the surface as are necessary
for its drilling and operations in the Retained Interests, which operations shall not unreasonably interfere with
those of Buyer and shall be conducted at Sellers (and, if applicable, its
co-owners) risk and expense. The term "Field" as used in this Section 1.1 and
elsewhere in this Agreement shall mean the aggregate of the Level 6 Accounting
Codes from Sellers accounting system that are listed as line items in
Exhibit "A" and are associated with a single Level 5 Accounting Code listed on
Exhibit "A", but specifically excluding any Level 6 Accounting Codes that are
not listed on Exhibit "A". The included Level 6 Accounting Codes have been
represented to Buyer as having generated the Production History referenced in
the last paragraph of this Section 1.1 and attached as Exhibit "A-2".



(b) Any and all oil and gas wells, salt water disposal wells, injection
wells and other wells and wellbores, whether abandoned, not abandoned,
plugged or unplugged, located on the Leases or within the Units or Land (as
defined below) (collectively, the "Wells").



(c) All buildings, structures, facilities, foundations, wellheads,
tanks, pumps, compressors, separators, casing, tubing, pumps, motors, gauges,
valves, heaters, treaters, gathering lines, gas lines, water lines, vessels,
boilers, equipment, machinery, fixtures, flowlines, materials, improvements,
and any other real, personal, immovable and mixed property located on and
currently or formerly used in the operation of, or relating to the in-field
production, treatment, sale, or disposal of Hydrocarbons (as hereinafter
defined), water, and associated substances produced from, the Leases, Land or
the Units (collectively, the "Personal Property").



(d) All natural gas, casinghead gas, drip gasoline, natural gasoline, natural
gas liquids, condensate, products, crude oil and other hydrocarbons,
whether gaseous or liquid ("Hydrocarbons"), produced and severed from, or
allocable, after severance, to the Leases, Land, the Units, the Wells or the
Contracts (as hereinafter defined) on and after the Effective Date (as defined
in Section 2.6) (collectively, the "Sale Hydrocarbons").



(e) To the extent transferable, and subject to Section 1.9, all contracts,
permits, rights-of-way, easements, servitudes, surface leases, subsurface use
agreements, licenses, pooling agreements, operating agreements, processing
agreements, division orders, farm-in and farm-out agreements, and other
agreements of any kind or nature, whether recorded or not (including but not
limited to those described on Exhibit "A") INSOFAR ONLY as they directly
relate and are attributable to the Leases, Units, the production from either
or both, the Land, Wells or Personal Property or the ownership or operation
thereof, or the production, treatment, sale, transportation, gathering,
storage or disposal of Sale Hydrocarbons, water, or substances associated
therewith (the "Contracts").



(f) All of the fee lands and real or immovable property (the "Land")
identified on the detailed listing of the Assets to be conveyed that will be
delivered by Seller to Buyer after execution of this Agreement as set forth in
the final paragraph of this Section 1.1 or identified under Section 1.1 (g)
below, which shall be conveyed to Buyer under a conveyance in a form legally
sufficient to transfer Sellers title under the laws of the State in which
such Land is located, and otherwise consistent with the terms of this
Agreement.



 

2 (g) Such other oil and gas leases or fee properties located in the vicinity of
the Fields described on Exhibit "A" that Seller may elect to transfer to
Buyer without additional consideration (the "Additional Properties"); provided
that Buyer may elect not to accept any Additional Property by giving written
notice to Seller prior to the Closing that Buyer in good faith believes that
such Additional Property has a negative fair market value. The Additional
Properties shall, upon such election by Seller, be considered part of the
Leases, the Units and/or the Lands, as applicable, except for any Additional
Properties that Buyer has elected not to accept as set forth herein.



(h) Records directly relating to the Leases, Units, Wells, Sale Hydrocarbons,
Contracts, Land and Personal Property, in the possession of Seller
(the "Records"), but excluding any records which (i) Seller is prohibited
from transferring to Buyer by law or existing contractual relationship, (ii)
have been archived pursuant to Sellers records management policies, or which
(iii) constitute Excluded Assets (as defined in Section 1.5); provided,
however, that Seller agrees to use reasonable efforts to make available to
Buyer upon request archived records in Sellers possession relating to the
Assets if such records are required by Buyer for purposes of responding to or
defending any litigation or claim pertaining to the Assets. Seller will
deliver originals, rather than copies, of those Records that pertain only to
Assets being transferred to Buyer. If the Records pertain both to Assets
being transferred to Buyer and to Excluded Assets as defined in Section 1.5
Seller may deliver copies to Buyer and retain the originals.



 

(i) All rights and obligations attributable to Production Imbalances and
Assigned Agreement Imbalances as defined in Section 14.1 (the
"Assigned Imbalances").



All such Leases, Units, Wells, Personal Property, Sale Hydrocarbons,
Contracts, Land, Records and Assigned Imbalances are hereinafter collectively
referred to as the "Assets." Within 15 days following execution of this
Agreement, Seller shall develop and deliver to Buyer for review
and verification a detailed listing of the Assets to be conveyed at the
Closing provided for in this Agreement. It is the intent of the parties that
such detailed listing shall describe and include all of Sellers undivided
interest in the Leases, Units, Wells, Personal Property, Contracts and Land
that generated the production information (net barrels of oil equivalent) and
operating cost information (net dollars) provided to Buyer by Seller for the
period from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003 (the "Production
History") as identified on Exhibit "A-2" hereto, plus any Additional
Properties that Seller may elect to transfer to Buyer pursuant to Section 1.1
(g) above.



1.2 _License of Seismic Data_. __As part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Seller shall grant to Buyer, at no additional cost or
consideration but subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, a non-
exclusive license to use the seismic data identified on Exhibit "B" hereto.
Seller shall only be obligated to license to Buyer each set of data listed on
Exhibit "B" to the extent that Seller has the right to grant such a license
and can, using reasonable commercial efforts prior to or within 60 days after
Closing, obtain all necessary consents and waivers from third parties without
additional cost to Seller. Subject to the foregoing limitations, Seller shall
grant the non-exclusive license using a form of License Agreement
substantially similar to that



 

3 attached hereto as Exhibit "B-1" (the "License"). The seismic data to be
licensed by Seller to Buyer shall be licensed "as is, where is" with the
express conditions and limitations noted in the License. Any use of such
seismic data by Buyer shall be at Buyers sole risk.



1.3 _Transfer of Assets_. __The risk of loss and transfer of possession and
control of the Assets shall occur and be made at Closing (as defined in
Section 12.3), but transfer of title to the Assets shall be made effective as
of the Effective Date (as defined in Section 2.6). Seller and Buyer shall
promptly execute such additional documents as may be necessary to
transfer the rights, titles or interests herein sold and purchased on the
records of any purchaser of Sale Hydrocarbons.



1.4 _Certain Assets Owned by Seller s Affiliates_. __Certain of the Assets
(identified on Exhibit "A") are owned entirely or in part by affiliates of
Seller and such affiliates  interests therein may not be sold without the
consent of such affiliates. Four Star Oil and Gas Company ("FSOG") owns an
interest in certain of the Assets listed on Exhibit "A" and has agreed in
writing to ratify and adopt this Agreement insofar as it pertains to those
interests owned by FSOG, such ratification, and any subsequent ratifications
by other Sellers, to be in a form substantially similar to that attached
hereto as Exhibit "D", and to convey such interests to Buyer at the Closing,
subject to all terms and conditions hereof. Upon execution of this Agreement
by Buyer and Seller, Seller will seek ratification of this Agreement by those
of its other affiliates that own interests in the Assets described herein.
Upon such ratification, such other affiliates shall be bound by all of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, insofar as this Agreement applies to
assets owned by them, and such assets will be conveyed by such affiliates to
Buyer at the Closing in accordance with this Agreement. Should any affiliate
of Seller, other than FSOG, that owns Assets described herein withhold its
ratification and consent to this Agreement, then such affiliates ownership
interest in the affected Assets will be excluded herefrom and Seller, at its
option, may also exclude herefrom Sellers own interest in the same Assets. In
the event of any such exclusions, the Purchase Price will be reduced by the
amount allocated to such Assets pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, with a pro
rata reduction in the event less than the full ownership interest of Seller
and its affiliates in a particular Asset is excluded, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary (including the
provisions of Section 6 or Section 8).



1.5 _Exclusions and Reservations_. __Specifically excepted and reserved from
the transactions are the following, hereinafter referred to as the "Excluded
Assets":



(a) Sellers proprietary data, reserve estimates and reports,
economic analyses, computer programs and applications, pricing forecasts,
legal files and legal opinions (except abstracts of title, title opinions,
certificates of title, or title curative documents), attorney-client
communications, attorney work product, and records and documents subject to
confidentiality provisions, claims of privilege or other restrictions on
access.



(b) Sellers rights, title and interests in the Contracts to the extent such
are applicable, attributable and allocable to rights and interest retained by
Seller, as more specifically described in Section 1.9.



 

4 (c) All of Sellers separate proprietary software and derivatives therefrom,
geophysical data, data licensing agreements and seismic licenses between
Seller and third parties, if any, and any and all geologic/geophysical
interpretations and proprietary or licensed raw or processed geophysical data

4.3  _Payment of Taxes  Assets Located in States Other Than Texas and
Oklahoma_. __



(a) All real estate, occupation, ad valorem, personal property taxes and
charges on any of the equipment, facilities, plants or other Assets located in
states other than Texas and Oklahoma for the current tax year shall be
prorated as of the Effective Date. Ad valorem or property taxes on the mineral
estate, the producing leasehold or the produced mineral, which are based on
production, severance and/or revenue received and which are taxed in a year
following the year of production, shall be subject to proration based on
production and revenue received by Buyer and Seller. Seller shall be
responsible for taxes based on production, severance and revenue received up
to the Effective Date, and shall be entitled to all refunds and rebates with
regard to such period; Buyer shall be responsible for taxes based on
production, severance and revenue from the Effective Date and thereafter,
regardless of the year in which the taxes are due or paid. Seller shall be
responsible for all oil and gas severance taxes, production taxes, windfall
profits taxes, and any other similar taxes applicable to oil and gas
production occurring prior to the Effective Date, and shall be entitled to all
refunds and rebates with regard to such period; Buyer



 

15 shall be responsible for all such taxes applicable to oil and gas production
occurring on and after the Effective Date. 



(b) Buyer shall be responsible for all sales, use and similar taxes arising
out of the sale of the Assets, if any. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller
all state and local sales or use taxes applicable to that portion of the
Assets which is tangible personal property, and Seller shall remit such amount
to the appropriate taxing authority in accordance with applicable law,
provided, however, that if Buyer holds a direct payment permit or other tax
registration which is valid at the time of the Closing, Buyer shall assume all
responsibility for remitting to the appropriate taxing authority the state
and local sales and use taxes due, and shall provide Seller with any exemption
certificates or other documentation required under applicable law in lieu of
paying Seller the taxes due. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller and the Seller Parties for any sales or use taxes assessed against
Seller at or after the Effective Date by any taxing authority in respect of
this sale, including the amounts of any penalties, interest, court costs and
attorneys fees. Any legal expenses incurred by Seller to reduce or avoid any
of the aforementioned taxes attributable to Buyer shall be paid or reimbursed
by the Buyer. In the event that the Effective Date is not within the same
calendar month as the Closing Date, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any
interest and penalties due and owing on any late reported sales or other
taxes. Buyer and Seller shall agree to reasonably cooperate to minimize the
assessment of any sales or use taxes assessed upon the Seller on any of the
Assets purchased by the Buyer.

20 6\. _Title Matters_



 

6.1 _Asset Title Review_. __Until Closing, Buyer shall have reasonable access,
without express or implied warranty of any kind regarding the accuracy of
such information, to copies of non-privileged information in Seller s
possession regarding Sellers title to the Assets, which information Buyer may
copy at its sole cost and expense (unless prohibited by agreement between
Seller and a third party). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be required to perform any additional title work. Any
existing abstracts and title opinions have not been made and will not be made
current by Seller. Buyer specifically agrees that any conclusions made from
any examination done or caused to be done from Seller furnished information
regarding title have resulted and shall result from its own independent
review, skill, knowledge and judgment only.



6.2 _Notice of Alleged Title Defects_. __If, prior to Closing, Buyer
determines the existence of an "Alleged Title Defect" as defined in Section
6.3, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of any matter Buyer considers to be
an Alleged Title Defect as soon as reasonably practicable after Buyer becomes
aware of such Alleged Title Defect, but, in any event, by not later than 4:00
p.m. Central Prevailing Time ("CPT"), 10 days prior to Closing (the "Defect
Notice Date"). Such notice ("Notice of Alleged Title Defect") shall include
(i) a specific description of the matter Buyer asserts as an Alleged Title
Defect, (ii) a specific description of the Asset or portion of the Assets that
is affected by the Alleged Title Defect, (iii) Buyer s calculation of the
amount by which each Alleged Title Defect has diminished the value of the
Assets, such amount to be determined by Buyer in good faith and in a
commercially reasonable manner, and (iv) all necessary and desirable
supporting documentation, including any abstracts and title opinions or
updates thereto that describe or explain the Alleged Title Defect.



6.3 _Alleged Title Defect_. __The term "Alleged Title Defect" shall refer to
any defect or deficiency in title, except for Permitted Encumbrances, that (i)
creates a lien, claim, encumbrance or other obligation affecting the
interests of Seller in the Assets, (ii) diminishes Seller s net revenue
interest (defined as Sellers share of the proceeds as of the Effective Date
from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from and allocable to the Assets, net
of all royalties, overriding royalties, and other burdens on production) from
that set forth on Exhibit "A", or (iii) increases Sellers working interest
(defined as Sellers share of the costs of operation, development or
production borne by the owner of such interest as of the Effective Date) from
that set forth in Exhibit "A" without a corresponding increase in Sellers net
revenue interest, or which creates an obligation to pay costs or expenses in
an amount greater than such interest. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 6.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement, no adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Alleged Title Defects shall be made unless and until, and
only to the extent that, (a) the individual value of each Alleged Title
Defect (with respect to all Assets affected) exceeds $200,000 and (b) the
value of all Aggregate Alleged Defects exceeds the Minimum Threshold amount
provided for in Section 8.1 below.



 

21 6.4 _Permitted Encumbrances_. __As used in this Section 6, the term "Permitted
Encumbrances" means: 



(a) Lessors royalties, non-participating royalties, overriding royalties,
division orders, sales and transportation contracts containing customary terms
and provisions, reversionary interests, and similar burdens if the net
cumulative effect of such burdens does not operate to reduce the net
revenue interest in any Asset as of the Effective Date to an amount less than
the net revenue interest set forth on Exhibit "A" or increase the working
interest of any Asset from that set forth in Exhibit "A" without a
corresponding increase in the revenue interest.



(b) Preferential rights to purchase and required non-governmental third party
consents to assignments and similar agreements with respect to which prior to
Closing (i) waivers or consents are obtained from the appropriate parties, or
(ii) the appropriate time period for asserting such rights has expired
without an exercise of such rights.



(c) Liens for taxes or assessments not yet due or delinquent or, if
delinquent, that are being contested in good faith in the normal course of
business.



(d) All rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other
actions by governmental entities in connection with the sale or conveyance of
oil and gas leases or interests therein, if the same are customarily obtained
subsequent to such sale or conveyance and Buyer and Seller have no reason to
believe they cannot be obtained.



(e) Alleged Title Defects or other deficiencies or irregularities that
have been waived by Buyer in writing or not asserted on or before the Defect
Notice Date.



(f) Easements, rights-of way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other
rights in respect of surface operations, provided they do not materially
interfere with Buyers operation or use of the Assets. 



(g) Defects, irregularities and deficiencies in title of or to any rights-of-
way, easements, surface leases or other rights which in the aggregate do not
materially impair the use of such rights-of-way, easements, surface leases or
other rights for the purpose for which such rights will be held by Buyer
and would not have a material adverse effect on the operation or value of any
of the Assets.



(h) Environmental laws and regulations, to the extent valid and applicable to
the Assets.



(i) Vendors, carriers, warehousemens, repairmens, mechanics, workmens,
materialmens, construction or other like liens which have expired as a
matter of law, or arising by operation of law in the ordinary course of
business or incident to the construction or improvement of any property in
respect of obligations which are not yet due.



 

22 (j) All other liens, claims, charges, encumbrances, contracts, agreements,
instruments, obligations, defects, and irregularities affecting the Assets
relating to obligations not yet in default, and/or which individually or in
the aggregate are not such as to interfere materially with the operation,
value, or use of any of the Assets, do not materially prevent Buyer from
receiving the proceeds of production from the Assets, do not reduce the net
revenue interest of any of the Assets as of the Effective Date to less than
the net revenue interest set forth on Exhibit "A" and do not obligate Buyer
to bear costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development, and
operation of any of the interests in any amount greater than the working
interest set forth on "A" (unless the net revenue interest for such Asset is
greater than the net revenue interest set forth in Exhibit "A" in the same
proportion as any increase in such working interest).



6.5 _Remedies for Title Failures_. __With respect to each Alleged Title Defect
asserted by Buyer in the Notice of Alleged Title Defect, if Seller
requests, Seller and Buyer shall discuss and agree whether a particular
matter constitutes an Alleged Title Defect. Seller shall have the right but
not the obligation to cure any Alleged Title Defect asserted in such Notice at
its own expense prior to Closing, in which case the parties shall proceed to
Closing without adjustment of the Purchase Price. If Seller fails to cure any
Alleged Title Defect on or prior to Closing, it shall be deemed to be a title
failure ("Title Failure") for the relevant Asset. Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to reach agreement regarding the value of any Title
Failure, and unless waived by Buyer shall mutually agree to one of the
following options with respect to each Title Failure, subject, however, to
the provisions of Section 8.1 hereof:



(a) If the Title Failure results from a difference in the net revenue
interest for a Lease as of the Effective Date from that shown on Exhibit "A",
the parties shall proceed to Closing and reduce the Purchase Price by an
amount (the "Defect Amount") determined by multiplying the amount of the
Purchase Price allocated to the affected Lease by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the difference between the actual net revenue interest being
conveyed and the net revenue interest shown on Exhibit "A" and the
denominator of which shall be the net revenue interest shown on Exhibit "A".



(b) If the Title Failure results from a difference in the working interest for
a Lease from that shown on Exhibit "A", the parties shall proceed to Closing
and reduce the Purchase Price by a Defect Amount determined by multiplying the
amount of the Purchase Price allocated to the affected Lease by a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the difference between the actual working
interest being conveyed and the working interest shown on Exhibit "A" and the
denominator of which shall be the working interest shown on Exhibit "A".



(c) If the Title Failure is one other than described in Sections 6.5 (a) or
(b), the Defect Amount shall be an amount determined in good faith by the
mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller, taking into account the portion of the
Purchase Price to be allocated by agreement of Seller and Buyer to the portion
of the Assets affected by the Title Failure, the legal effect of the Title
Failure, and the potential economic effect of the Title Failure over the life
of the Assets.



 

23 6.6 _Waiver; Effect of Seller s Special Warranty_. __Except for the special
warranty of title given by Seller in the Assignment(s), as limited by this
Section 6.6, Buyer waives for all purposes all objections associated with the
title to the Assets (including Alleged Title Defects), unless raised by proper
notice within the applicable time period set forth in Section 6.2 and not
cured or settled under Section 6.5; and Buyer (and on behalf of the Buyer
Parties and their successors and assigns) irrevocably waives any and all
claims they may have against Seller and the Seller Parties associated with
the same. Any Alleged Title Defect created by, through or under Seller and
constituting a breach of Seller s Special Warranty of Title shall not be
subject to the dollar limitations set forth in Section 6.3 or the Minimum
Threshold for Aggregate Alleged Defects set forth in Section 8.1. It is
agreed, however, that no Permitted Encumbrance, as defined in Section 6.4,
shall be deemed to breach Sellers Special Warranty of Title, except for any
matter that falls within the definition of "Permitted Encumbrance" solely as
a result of Buyers failure to assert such matter on or before the Defect
Notice Date as referenced in Section 6.4 (e).



7\. _Environmental Matters_



7.1 _Environmental Review_. __Until Closing, Buyer may request access to the
Assets (if operated by Seller) and the non-privileged environmental data
in Seller s files pertaining to the Assets. Buyer may request Sellers
assistance in gaining access to Assets operated by others, but Buyer will be
responsible for contacting the operators of such Assets to arrange for review
and inspection, at Buyers sole cost, risk and expense. Buyer specifically
acknowledges that (a) any access to Seller-operated Assets or Sellers data is
given as an accommodation only, at Buyers sole cost, risk and expense, that
Seller makes no representations whatsoever as to the accuracy, completeness,
or reliability of any such environmental information so, or otherwise,
disclosed to or obtained by Buyer and (b) Buyer relies and depends on and uses
any and all such environmental information, review or inspection exclusively
and entirely at its own risk and without any recourse to Seller whatsoever.
Seller shall cooperate with Buyer for the performance by Buyer of any
additional environmental testing at Buyers expense prior to Closing, which
testing shall be conducted in a reasonable manner so as not to interfere with
Sellers or operators operation of the Assets, and Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate to ensure that such testing is performed on an expedited and
confidential basis before Closing. Results of any such tests shall be treated
as confidential, except to the extent disclosure is required under applicable
law.



7.2 _Alleged Environmental Defects_. __Buyer shall notify Seller in writing no
later than 4:00 p.m. CPT, 10 days prior to Closing (the "Defect Notice Date")
in the event Buyer believes that the environment associated with the Assets
contains an "Alleged Environmental Defect", which is defined as a violation of
Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 7.5) to the extent that (a) as to
each individual Alleged Environmental Defect (i) prosecution, if instituted,
would be reasonably likely to result in a penalty, fine or damage payment of
$250,000 or more, or (ii) performance of corrective work in respect of such
Alleged Environmental Defect required by Environmental Laws would be
reasonably likely to result in expenditures of $250,000 or more, net to Seller
s interest in the affected Asset, or (iii) the combination of sums
under subparts (i) and (ii) above exceeds $250,000, net to Sellers interest
in the affected Asset, and (b) the value of all Aggregate Alleged Defects
exceeds the Minimum Threshold provided for in Section 8.1.



 

24 Such notification (the "Notice of Alleged Environmental Defect") shall include
(i) a detailed description of such claims, (ii) a copy of any environmental
assessments, reports, data and information pertaining to such claims, and
(iii) Buyers calculation of the amount by which such claims have diminished
the value of the Assets, which amount shall be determined by Buyer in good
faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.



7.3  _Remedies for Alleged Environmental Defect_. __With respect to each
Alleged Environmental Defect asserted by Buyer in the Notice of Alleged
Environmental Defect, if Seller requests, Seller and Buyer shall discuss and
agree whether a particular matter constitutes an Alleged Environmental
Defect. As to each claim of an Alleged Environmental Defect made by Buyer on
or prior to the Defect Notice Date (and upon satisfaction of the aggregate
Alleged Defect Minimum Threshold set forth in Section 8.1 below), Buyer and
Seller shall endeavor to agree upon one of the following three (3) options,
with option 7.3 (c) being the default selection in the event the parties are
unable to agree:



(a) Prior to or at Closing, Seller and Buyer shall mutually agree in
writing separate and apart from this Agreement that Seller shall correct or
make arrangements for the correction of such Alleged Environmental Defect, and
Closing shall proceed with Seller defending, indemnifying and holding Buyer
and the Buyer Parties harmless against all Claims attributable to such
Alleged Environmental Defect and without reduction of the Purchase Price;



(b) Buyer shall correct or make arrangements for the correction of such
Alleged Environmental Defect after Closing, and the parties shall proceed
to Closing with a reduction of the Purchase Price in an amount mutually
agreed to by the parties and with Buyer defending, indemnifying and holding
Seller and the Seller Parties harmless against all Claims attributable to such
Alleged Environmental Defect; or



(c) Buyer shall accept the Assets subject to such Alleged Environmental
Defect, the parties shall proceed to Closing without adjustment of the
Purchase Price, and Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold Buyer and the
Buyer Parties harmless against all Claims incurred by Buyer with respect to
such Alleged Environmental Defect, up to, but in no event to exceed, the sum
of Fifty Million Dollars (such amount being cumulative for any and all claims
of Alleged Environmental Defect made by Buyer). In the event of a claim of an
Alleged Environmental Defect and a demand for indemnification by Buyer
hereunder, Seller reserves the right to jointly negotiate with Buyer and the
agency or party, if any, making such claim the right of access to the affected
site, the use of temporary storage and resources at such site, to the full
extent held by Buyer, and the right to perform assessment, removal and
remedial operations for such Alleged Environmental Defect, at its cost and
risk, and any sums so expended by Seller shall be a credit against Sellers
indemnity obligation, if any, under this Section 7.3 (c).



Each party shall cooperate with the other partys reasonable corrective work,
and any operations unreasonably interfering with the corrective work shall
cease until correction is completed.



7.4 _Indemnity Provisions_. __The indemnities for Alleged Environmental
Defects and for Claims related thereto, as provided for in this Section 7, by
Buyer and Seller, as the case may be,



 

25 for Claims shall include, without limitation, the obligation to protect,
indemnify, hold harmless and defend Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and
the Buyer Parties and Seller Parties, respectively, against any and all
claims, demands, losses, liabilities, liens, judgments, settlements, suits,
causes of action, fines, penalties, fees (including, without limitation,
attorneys fees and court costs), costs, expenses (including, without
limitation, expenses associated with investigation of claims, testing and
assessment), whether based on any theory of liability, including, but not
limited to, negligence, tort, breach of contract (express or implied), breach
of warranty (express or implied), strict liability, regulatory liability, or
statutory liability, regardless of the sole, joint or concurrent negligence,
strict liability, regulatory liability, statutory liability, breach of
contract, breach of warranty, or other fault or responsibility of Buyer or
Seller or any other person or party, arising under any obligations under this
Agreement or imposed by any applicable statutes, laws, rules, regulations, or
orders. The indemnities will further include an agreement by the party
providing the indemnification to take whatever actions are necessary to
protect the party being indemnified from being subjected to any such
claims, demands, losses, liabilities, liens, judgments, settlements, suits,
causes of action, fines, penalties, fees, costs or expenses, and to comply
with reasonable requests by the party being indemnified to take such actions.



7.5 _Post-Closing Environmental Indemnification by Buyer_. __As of the
Closing, but subject to the provisions of Sections 7.3 and 7.6, Buyer
specifically assumes and shall be responsible for all environmentally-related
duties and obligations of Seller and the Seller Parties with respect to the
Assets from and after the Effective Date and shall protect, defend, indemnify
and hold Seller and the Seller Parties harmless from and against any and all
Claims under any Environmental Law (hereafter defined) with respect to the
Assets from and after the Effective Date, including without limitation, any
environmentally-related duties, conditions and obligations existing prior to
or as of the Effective Date or relating to periods arising before the
Effective Date. The term "Environmental Law(s)" as used here and elsewhere in
this Agreement includes the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 29 U.S.C.A.
§651, et seq.; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C.A. §6901,
et seq.; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C.A. §9601, et seq.; the Clean Water Act, 33
U.S.C.A. §1251 et seq.; the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.A. §7401, et seq.; the
Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C.A. §3001, et seq.; the Toxic Substances
Control Act, 15 U.S.C.A. §2601 et seq.; the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33
U.S.C.A. §2701 et seq.; and all rules, regulations and orders adopted under
the foregoing statutes, applicable state statutes addressing similar matters,
or state or federal statutes enacted after the date of this Agreement
applicable to any waste material, produced water, tank bottoms, sludge, or
constituents thereof, radioactive materials (including NORM, as defined in
Section 7.7), or hazardous substances on or included with the Assets or the
presence, disposal, release or threatened release of all waste material,
produced water, tank bottoms, sludge, or constituents thereof, radioactive
materials (including NORM), or hazardous substances on, included with, or
emanating from or through the Assets into the atmosphere or in or upon land or
any water course or body of water, whether above or below the ground, and all
other federal, state and local environmental and oil and gas laws and
regulations, as well as all acts, laws, and regulations amendatory or
supplemental thereto.



 

26 7.6 _Exclusion from Buyer s Indemnification. ___Anything in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, it is agreed and understood that Buyer shall
have no liability for, and Buyer s post-Closing environmental indemnification
of Seller shall not include any responsibility for disposal off-site from the
Assets, that occurred at any time before the Closing Date, of hazardous
substances, wastes, materials and products generated by or used by or used in
connection with Sellers operation of the Assets.



7.7 _CONDITION OF THE ASSETS AND SPECIFIC BUYER INDEMNIFICATION WITH RESPECT
TO NORM AND OTHER HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES_. __Buyer specifically assumes the
risk of the condition of the Assets and shall inspect the Assets prior to
Closing, or hereby expressly waives such right, if not exercised. Any such
inspection, if made, shall cover, but not be limited to, the physical
and environmental condition, both surface and subsurface, of the Assets. It
is expressly recognized by Buyer that the lands and/or water bottoms, along
with surface facilities and production equipment located thereon, having been
used in connection with oil, gas, and water production, treatment, storage,
and disposal activities, may contain naturally occurring radioactive materials
("NORM"), asbestos and other hazardous substances as a result of these
operations. The generation, formation, or presence of NORM, asbestos or other
hazardous substances in or on the Assets shall, after the Effective Date set
forth herein, be the sole responsibility of Buyer, and Buyer and all future
assignees and successors of Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold Seller and
the Seller Parties harmless from any and all Claims resulting from any and all
claims, demands, losses, liabilities, liens, judgments, settlements, suits,
causes of action, fines, penalties, fees (including, without limitation,
attorneys fees and court costs), costs, and expenses (including, without
limitation, expenses associated with investigation of claims, testing and
assessment), whether based on any theory of negligence, tort, breach of
contract, breach of warranty, strict liability, regulatory liability or
statutory liability, regardless of the sole, joint or concurrent negligence,
breach of contract, breach of warranty, strict liability, regulatory
liability, statutory liability, or other fault or responsibility of Seller or
any other person or party, asserted or filed on or after the Effective Date in
any way arising from, resulting from or related to the presence of NORM,
asbestos or other hazardous substances, whether such NORM, asbestos or other
hazardous substance was in place before or after the Effective Date. Any
conveyance, transfer or assignment of all or part of the Assets by Buyer, its
successors or assigns, in which the grantee, transferee or assignee fails
to expressly assume this obligation shall be deemed null and void.
Accordingly, lands and/or water bottoms, the Wells, and the Personal Property
transferred herein are transferred with the restriction that they will be used
only in connection with oil and gas producing activities associated with the
Leases, and will not be subsequently transferred by Buyer or Buyer s assignee
for unrestricted use unless the concentrations of NORM, asbestos or other
hazardous substances associated therewith are independently determined by a
competent laboratory and are found below the levels specified as allowable for
unrestricted transfer as set forth in any and all applicable laws, orders,
rules or regulations of any governmental agency or court having jurisdiction.
Additionally, Buyer agrees to comply with all provisions of such laws, orders,
rules or regulations applicable to said lands and/or water bottoms, the Wells,
and the Personal Property. Buyer further agrees to cause the provisions of
this clause to be included in all subsequent sales or transfers of any
interest in the Assets, and to cause all purchasers or transferees of the
Assets to expressly acknowledge and assume all such obligations.



 

27 7.8 _Waiver_. __Buyer waives for all purposes all objections associated with
the environmental and physical and other condition of the Assets (including
Environmental Contamination and Alleged Environmental Defect), unless raised
by proper notice within the applicable time period set forth in Section 7.2
and made Seller s responsibility under Sections 7.3 or 7.6; and Buyer (on
behalf of itself and the Buyer Parties and their successors and assigns)
irrevocably waives any and all claims, except Claims covered under Sellers
indemnities pursuant to Sections 7.3 and 7.6, that they may now or hereafter
have against Seller and the Seller Parties associated with the same.



8\. _Aggregate Alleged Defects and Associated Termination Right_ s



8.1 _Minimum Threshold for Aggregate Alleged Defects_. __For the purpose of
determining adjustments to the Purchase Price or triggering Seller s
obligation to respond to Alleged Defects under Sections 6 or 7, the
Alleged Title Defects and/or Alleged Environmental Defects ("Aggregate
Alleged Defects") must exceed Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00) before
there shall be any Purchase Price Adjustment or further action required of
Seller under Sections 6 or 7 with respect to such asserted Alleged Title
Defects and/or Alleged Environmental Defects. Upon the Fifty Million Dollar
threshold being reached, Alleged Title Defects and/or Alleged Environmental
Defects shall be handled pursuant to the applicable Section, provided,
however, that the first Fifty Million Dollars of Aggregate Alleged Defects
under either one of the referenced Sections, or both collectively, shall be
treated as a deductible amount to be satisfied by Buyer.

 



8.2 _Termination Amount_. __Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
if the total amount of Aggregate Alleged Defects should reach or exceed One
Hundred Million Dollars, then either party shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement, without any liability, upon written notice to the other party on or
prior to the Closing pursuant to the provisions of Section 14.8. If either
party exercises its option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.2, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, Seller shall
promptly return the Deposit to Buyer (exclusive of interest earned), and
neither party shall have any further right or duty to or claim against the
other party under this Agreement, except as expressly provided to the contrary
in this Agreement.



9\. _Employees and Employee Benefits_



9.1 _Offers of Employment_. __



(a) As soon as practical after execution of this Agreement (the "Execution
Date"), Seller will provide Buyer a list of those of Sellers employees who
have directly supported Sellers operation of the Assets and who Seller does
not expect to offer employment in Sellers other operations. Such listed
employees are referred to herein as the "Prospective Employees". Buyer shall
then be afforded an opportunity to interview and consider for employment with
Buyer those of the Prospective Employees who consent to be interviewed by
Buyer for potential employment.



 

28 Upon completion of its interview and evaluation process, Buyer shall make
employment offers to those of the Prospective Employees whom Buyer wishes to
employ in its ongoing operations.



(b) Buyers employment offers to Prospective Employees shall be made in
writing during a "hiring period" beginning on the Execution Date and ending
two weeks prior to the scheduled Closing Date. Buyer may require
each Prospective Employee to submit a formal application for employment and
submit to Buyers customary hiring procedures. Each such employment offer
shall be for a position with Buyer at a salary or wage that is no less than
the base salary (or the base wage rate) plus any shift, incentive or piece-
rate differentials applicable with respect to such Prospective Employee on the
Closing Date ("Equivalent Wage"). Equivalent Wage shall not include the value
of any benefit plan or program, including without limitation, the
ChevronTexaco Success Sharing Program and/or Management Incentive Plan, or any
other company incentive program in effect as of the Closing Date. Each such
employment offer shall also be for a position at a work location that is
fifty miles or less from the Prospective Employees work location at the time
of the offer.



(c) Such employment offers shall provide that employment with the Buyer shall
commence on the first day immediately following the Closing Date ("General
Hire Date") and shall be conditioned upon Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall have no obligation under this Agreement to employ any
Prospective Employee who accepts its employment offer but does not
actively report for work with Buyer on the General Hire Date, unless (1) such
Employee is on vacation, scheduled time off, or other similar Seller-approved
absence and commences active work with Buyer upon the termination of such
approved absence; or (2) such Employee is absent from work due to illness or
injury and reports for active work with Buyer within thirty days after the
General Hire Date.



(i) Any Prospective Employee selected by Buyer who has accepted his or her
employment offer but is on vacation, scheduled time off, or on other Seller-
approved absence on the General Hire Date shall become the Buyers employee,
as applicable, on the General Hire Date.



(ii) Any Prospective Employee who accepts Buyers employment offer but is
absent from work due to illness or injury, and who reports for active
work with Buyer within thirty days after the General Hire Date, shall become
the Buyers employee upon reporting for active work.



(iii) Any Prospective Employee who accepts Buyers offer for employment but
who fails to report for work in accordance with this Section 9.1 (c) shall
not become Buyers employee for any purpose under this Agreement.



(d) Seller will terminate the employment of all Prospective Employees who
accept Buyers employment offers on the Closing Date, provided Seller will
terminate the employment of any Prospective Employee described in clause
(c)(ii) above effective on the earlier of the day immediately before reporting
for work with Buyer or thirty days after the General Hire Date. Prospective
Employees who become Buyers employees as of the General Hire Date (or, in
the 



 

29 case of Employees described in clause (c)(ii) above, within thirty days after
the General Hire Date), are the "Affected Employees." Prospective Employees
who do not become Affected Employees are "Remaining Employees."



(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall affect Buyers right to terminate the
employment of any Affected Employee on or after the date he or she
becomes Buyers employee, with or without cause; provided that Buyer shall
comply with the terms of the severance program required by Section 9.4.2 below
if such termination is prior to one year after the General Hire Date.



(f) Buyer shall control and be responsible for the process by which the
Buyer offers employment to Prospective Employees. Buyer may interview any
Prospective Employee during normal working hours (including interviews on
site) consistent with the operating requirements of Seller and, with the
written permission of the Prospective Employee (a copy of which written
permission shall be furnished to Buyer), may review and retain copies of such
Prospective Employees training, attendance and safety records (if any)
maintained by Seller. All of the original personnel records maintained by
Seller relating to the Prospective Employees shall remain with Seller after
the Closing Date and shall not be turned over to Buyer. Buyer shall, however,
have access to and use of such records as may be required in connection with
the prosecution or defense of any administrative or court claim, and Seller
shall not destroy any such records prior to the time such records are
scheduled for destruction pursuant to Sellers records retention policy
applicable to records of this type.



(g) Buyer shall not reduce an Affected Employees salary (or wage rate) below
the Affected Employees Equivalent Wage prior to one year after the General
Hire Date.



9.2 _Defined Benefit Pension Plans_. __



9.2.1 _Seller s Defined Benefit Pension Plan_. __



 

Seller shall cause the ChevronTexaco Corporation Retirement Plan and related
excess or top hat benefit plans designed to provide benefits not
otherwise payable under the ChevronTexaco Corporation Retirement Plan due to
various Internal Revenue Code limitations or limitations to compensation taken
into account under the ChevronTexaco Corporation Retirement Plan ("Sellers
Pension Plan") to:



(a) retain all liability for pension benefits, including under Sellers
Pension Plan, accrued by each Affected Employee as of the Transfer Date;



(b) provide for distributions to any Affected Employee eligible for an
immediate distribution as of the date he or she terminates employment with
Seller when permitted by the provisions of Sellers Pension Plan; and



(c) fully vest each Affected Employee in his or her accrued benefits under the
Sellers Pension Plan effective as of the Transfer Date.



 

30 For purposes of the foregoing, however, vesting in an excess or top hat
benefit plan shall be construed to mean that ones rights under the plans
terms are non-forfeitable, not that the Affected Employee is vested in the
particular amount that would be payable under such plans if he or she
commenced a distribution on the Transfer Date.



9.2.2 _Buyer s Pension Plan_. __Buyer does not currently maintain a defined
benefit pension plan for its employees. In the event Buyer subsequently
establishes a defined benefit pension plan that is qualified under Section 401
of the Internal Revenue Code ("Buyer s Pension Plan") Buyer shall allow each
Affected Employee to participate in such plan on the same terms as Buyers
other similarly situated employees.



9.3 _Qualified Defined Contribution Plans_. __



9.3.1 _Seller s Defined Contribution Plan_. __All Affected Employees are
vested in the ChevronTexaco Employee Savings Investment Plan ("Seller s
Defined Contribution Plan") under the terms of such Plan. Seller shall cause
the Sellers Defined Contribution Plan to provide for the distribution of such
Affected Employees vested benefits in accordance with such Plans
distribution rules.



9.3.2 _Buyer s Defined Contribution Plan_. __Buyer currently maintains a
defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401 of the Internal
Revenue Code ("Buyer s Defined Contribution Plan"). Buyers Defined
Contribution Plan shall not be terminated prior to one year after the Hire
Date.



9.4  _Severance Plans_. __



9.4.1 _Seller s Severance Pay Plans_. __Seller shall cause the execution of
a severance pay plan(s) for the benefit of qualifying Prospective Employees
("Seller s Severance Pay Plans"). Prospective Employees will only receive
severance pay in connection with the termination of their employment with
Seller if they qualify for it under the terms of Sellers Severance Pay Plans.
Without limitation, Sellers Severance Pay Plans shall provide that a
Prospective Employee is ineligible for severance pay if he or she received an
employment offer from Buyer at an Equivalent Wage and at a work location
within 50 miles of his or her work location with Seller at the Closing Date,
regardless of whether such offer is accepted or rejected. In addition,
Sellers Severance Pay Plans shall provide that no Affected Employee shall be
eligible for severance pay.



9.4.2 _Buyer s Severance Program_.



(a) If within one year of the General Hire Date:



(i) Buyer involuntarily terminates the employment of an Affected Employee (for
reasons other than cause or to commence employment with another entity within
Buyers Controlled Group),



 

31 (ii) the Affected Employee elects to terminate employment with the Buyer (or
another entity within Buyers Controlled Group) rather than be required to
transfer to a job location more than 50 miles from his or her current job
location, or



(iii) the Affected Employee elects to terminate employment with the Buyer (or
another entity within the Buyers Controlled Group) rather than accept a
reduction in compensation below his or her Equivalent Wage (without regard to
whether such reduction in compensation would violate Section 9.1 (g) of this
Agreement),



Buyer shall provide severance pay and other benefits to such Affected Employee
as described below ("Buyers Severance Program"). Buyer agrees to adopt such
Buyers Severance Program no later than the General Hire Date and not to
terminate it or amend it in a manner inconsistent with this Section 9.4 prior
to one year after the General Hire Date. 



(b) Buyers Severance Program shall provide severance pay in an amount no
less than two weeks of such Affected Employees Equivalent Wage (or his then-
current base rate of pay, if greater) for each combined year of service with
Seller and Buyer (each including any other entity within its
respective Controlled Group). Such service shall be prorated for completed
calendar months and subject to a minimum of four years and a maximum of
twenty-six years. Service with Seller for these purposes shall be Sellers
service used to calculate severance pay under Sellers Severance Pay Plan.
Buyers Severance Program shall also provide for the continuation of employee
rates and Buyers contribution for medical coverage that are applicable to
otherwise similarly situated active Buyer employees for up to six months
after the Closing Date.



As soon as reasonably practicable after the termination of each Affected
Employees employment with Seller, Seller shall provide Buyer with such
Affected Employees service (as defined in Sellers Severance Pay Plan).



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may condition eligibility for
any benefit under Buyers Severance Program on the execution of a release or
waiver of any liability. Such release or waiver shall be in such form as Buyer
determines in its sole discretion.



9.5 _Vacation Pay_. __Affected Employees shall be subject to Buyer s
vacation pay policy on the same basis as its otherwise similarly situated new
employees



9.6 _Health Care Plans_. __



9.6.1 _In General_. __Subject to the following, Affected Employees shall be
eligible to participate in Buyer s health care plans to the same extent as
its otherwise similarly situated employees. Affected Employees shall be
eligible to enroll in such plans (on behalf of themselves and their eligible
dependents) with coverage commencing immediately upon commencement of their
employment with Buyer (or another entity within the Buyers Controlled Group).
If such Affected Employee was enrolled in Sellers corresponding health care
plan upon termination of Sellers employment, Buyer shall cause its
corresponding health care plans to: (i) waive any pre-existing condition
limitations; and (ii) recognize the Affected Employees expenditures
(including those of his covered dependents) under Sellers corresponding plan
for the calendar



 

32 year in which the Affected Employee becomes Buyers employee, as applicable,
toward any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket limit in the
corresponding Buyers health care plan for such calendar year. In addition,
Buyer will cause Buyers Health Care Plans to waive any pre-existing condition
limitation where required to comply with the provisions of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA").



9.7 _Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits_. __



9.7.1 _Seller s Post Retirement Health Care Coverage_. __Seller shall be
responsible for any post-retirement medical, mental health, substance abuse,
and dental coverage for the Remaining Employees ("Seller s Post-Retirement
Health Care Coverage"). Seller also shall make available Post-Retirement
Health Care Coverage to any Affected Employee who as of the date he or she
terminates employment with Seller is eligible to receive and enroll in
Sellers Post-Retirement Health Care Coverage ("Eligible Affected Employees").
For purposes of calculating the amount of any Company contributions toward
such coverage, Seller shall have no obligation to consider any age greater
than the Affected Employees age upon termination of employment with Seller or
any service with Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers Post-
Retirement Health Care Coverage shall be subject to Sellers unilateral
and discretionary right (including the rights of any entity within Sellers
Controlled Group) to amend or terminate such coverage at any time and with
respect to any Eligible Affected Employees.



9.7.2 _Buyer s Post Retirement Health Care Coverage_. __ Affected Employees
shall be eligible to qualify for any Buyer s Post-Retirement Health Care
Coverage on a basis no less favorable than that applicable to Buyers
otherwise similarly situated employees.



9.8 _WARN Act Compliance_. __Buyer shall be responsible for compliance with
the notification or other requirements of the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended ("WARN Act"), with respect to
the Affected Employees in connection with actions taken by Buyer on or after
the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible for WARN Act compliance with
respect to all other employees of Seller, including the Remaining Employees.



9.9 _Buyer s Other Employee Benefits_. __Buyer agrees that as of the date an
Affected Employee becomes Buyer s employee (including any entity within the
Buyers Controlled Group), he or she will be eligible to participate in
Buyers employee benefit plans and programs that are not specifically
described in this Section 9 which are generally applicable to Buyers non-
Affected Employee employees (or, at the time he or she may retire, will be
eligible to participate in the retiree employee benefit plans and programs for
which he or she qualifies based upon his or her age and service and which are
generally applicable to similarly situated retirees of Buyer) under Buyers
employee benefit plans and programs, whether in effect on the General Hire
Date or subsequently established by Buyer. In addition, if the Affected
Employee (or his covered dependent) was participating in the Sellers similar
employee welfare benefit plan as of the date his or her employment with the
Seller terminates, Buyer will cause such Buyers employee welfare benefit plan
to waive any and all restrictions relating to pre-existing conditions and
evidence of insurability. For purposes of such waiver, if Seller had no
similar employee welfare



 

33 benefit plan, Buyer will presume participation and satisfaction of pre-
existing condition limitations on the part of the Affected Employee (or his
covered dependents).



9.10 _General Employee Provisions_. __



(a) Each of Seller and Buyer shall give any notices required by law and take
whatever other actions with respect to the plans, programs and policies
described in this Section 9 as may be necessary to carry out the arrangements
described in this Section 9. Seller and Buyer shall provide each other with
such plan documents and descriptions, employee data or other information as
may be reasonably required to carry out the arrangements described in this
Section 9.



(b) If any of the arrangements described in this Section 9 are determined by
the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable governmental authority, or
by a court of competent jurisdiction, to be prohibited by law, Seller and
Buyer shall modify such arrangements to (as closely as possible) retain the
intent and economic benefits and burdens of the Parties as reflected herein
in a manner which is not prohibited by law.



(c) In the event that Buyer hires any Remaining Employee within six months
after he or she terminates Sellers employment, Buyer will notify Seller of
such event and shall reimburse Seller for any severance pay paid by Seller to
such Remaining Employee within three business days after the date they are
employed by Buyer.



9.11 _Definition of Controlled Groups_. __For purposes of this Section 9, the
term "Controlled Group" shall have the same meaning as "controlled group of
corporations" as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 1563(a), without
giving effect to Internal Revenue Code Sections 1563(a)(4) and 1563(e)(3)(C).



10\. _Additional Covenants_



10.1 _Operations Prior to Closing_. __After the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing as to any of the Assets operated by Seller, Seller, in
its sole discretion, shall use, operate and maintain the Assets in
substantially the same manner in which they have been used, operated and
maintained prior to this Agreement. During the period from the Effective Date
until Seller is replaced as operator, Seller as operator shall have no
liability to Buyer for losses, Claims or damages sustained or liabilities
incurred, regardless of the sole, joint or concurrent negligence, strict
liability, regulatory liability, statutory liability, breach of contract,
breach of warranty, or other fault or responsibility of Seller or any other
person or party, except such Buyer losses, Claims or damages as may result
from Seller s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Seller shall not be
obligated for any expenditures after the execution of this Agreement or the
Effective Date, whichever is the earlier, and shall recover any charges and
expenses as part of the Final Settlement Statement adjustments as appropriate



 

34 10.2 _Preferential Ri_ _ghts to Purchase._ __



10.2.1 _Issuance of Notices_. __Seller shall use the allocations provided by
Buyer pursuant to Section 2.3 to provide any required preferential right to
purchase notifications to third parties.



10.2.2 _Third Party Exercise_. __If a third party gives notice of its intent
to exercise a preferential right to purchase any of the Assets, the affected
Assets will not be sold to Buyer and the Purchase Price will be adjusted by
the allocation for the affected Asset. If Buyer has allocated a positive
dollar amount to the preferential right Asset, the Purchase Price will be
reduced by the dollar amount of the positive allocation. If Buyer
has allocated a negative dollar amount to the preferential right Asset, the
Purchase Price will be increased by the absolute value of the negative
allocation. Buyer remains obligated to purchase the remainder of the Assets
not affected by exercised preferential rights to purchase. Any preferential
purchase right must be exercised subject to and on the same terms and
conditions of this Agreement.



10.2.3 _Third Party Failure to Purchase_. __If a third party gives notice of
its intent to exercise a preferential right to purchase any of the Assets,
but does not close the purchase for any reason, either before or within a
reasonable time after Closing, then there shall promptly be an additional
Closing between Seller and Buyer for such portion of the Assets pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, by which Seller will transfer the affected
portion of the Assets to Buyer and Buyer will promptly pay Seller that portion
of the Purchase Price attributable thereto (or in the case of a negative
allocation, Seller will refund the absolute value of the negative amount to
Buyer, without interest).



10.2.4 _Successor Operator_. __Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller
cannot and does not covenant or warrant that Buyer shall become successor
operator of the Assets or portions thereof which Seller may presently
operate, since same may be subject to unit, pooling, communitization or
operating agreements or other agreements which control the appointment of a
successor operator. Seller agrees, however, that, where it will, in the
opinion of Seller, facilitate the appointment of a successor operator, it
will, in a prudent manner, resign as operator of the Assets it operates before
or after Closing.



10.3 _HSR Clearance_. __Upon execution of this Agreement, both parties as
promptly as possible shall file with the Federal Trade Commission and/or
the Department of Justice, as applicable, the required notification and
report forms due under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Acts of
1976 ("HSR Act") and shall as promptly as practicable furnish any supplemental
information that may be requested in connection therewith. Each party shall
take all reasonable steps to achieve early termination of applicable HSR Act
waiting periods.



11\. _Covenants, Assignments And Continuing Obligations_



It is the intent and effect of this Agreement that the conveyance, transfer or
assignment of any Assets by Buyer or any future conveyances, transfers or
assignments made by Buyer shall not in any way diminish, compromise,
extinguish, or effect a release of Sellers rights against Buyer, or



 

35 Buyers obligations to Seller. It is also the intent and effect of this
Agreement that all conveyances, transfers or assignments of any Assets by
Buyer and all future conveyances, transfers or assignments made by Buyer shall
create rights in favor of Seller under this Agreement and under all subsequent
conveyances, transfers or assignments pertaining to the Assets, and that
Seller is a third party beneficiary of such subsequent conveyances, transfers
or assignments, so that the party or parties to whom Buyer conveys, transfers
or assigns any Assets shall likewise be bound with Buyer to Seller
for performance of Buyers obligations to Seller under this Agreement. Buyer
specifically agrees and warrants that in the event of future conveyances,
transfers or assignments of the Assets (in whole or in part) by Buyer, Buyer
shall require that as part of the conveyances, transfers or assignments the
party or parties to whom the Assets are conveyed, transferred or assigned
shall agree to assume, be bound by and subject to all of Buyers obligations
to Seller under this Agreement and shall fulfill those obligations. Buyer
further agrees, understands and warrants that in the event of future
conveyances, transfers or assignments of the Assets (in whole or in part) by
Buyer, Buyer shall remain bound and subject to all of Buyers obligations to
Seller and shall remain responsible for fulfilling those obligations even
though Buyer has conveyed, transferred or assigned the Assets. Buyer further
agrees, understands and warrants that all future assignments, conveyances or
transfers of any Assets shall also be accompanied by the assignees, grantees
or transferees acceptance and full assumption of the obligations that Buyer
owes to Seller. The obligations and responsibilities of Buyer to Seller, and
of Buyers assignees, grantees or transferees to Seller, shall be joint and
several and shall run with the Assets assigned, conveyed or transferred, so
that all subsequent assignees, grantees and transferees also accept the
same obligations to Seller, without Buyer or any assignees, grantees or
transferees being released of any of their obligations to Seller. Such
obligations shall include, but not be limited to, those involving abandonment
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions, indemnities, liabilities, and
assumed risks.



12\. _Closing, Termination and Final Adjustments_

Gas Company, now called TXU Gas Distribution, as such contract has been
amended from time to time, has been reviewed by Buyer and is considered to be
market sensitive for purposes of this provision). For purposes of this Section
12.2 (d), the sum of all such matters shall not be considered "material" if
(i) the net adverse economic impact on Buyer of all such matters is
reasonably anticipated to be no more than the Special Deductible (hereinafter
defined), or (ii) the net adverse economic impact on Buyer of all such matters
is reasonably anticipated to exceed the Special Deductible and Seller has
offered to reduce the Purchase Price at Closing by the amount such net adverse
economic impact on Buyer exceeds the Special Deductible. For purposes of this
Section 12.2 (d) the term "Special Deductible" means the positive amount, if
any, arrived at by subtracting from $50,000,000.00 the amount of Aggregate
Alleged Defects applied against the Minimum Threshold for Aggregate Alleged
Defects as described in Section 8.1. If such calculation does not yield
a positive amount, then the Special Deductible shall be zero.



(e) All applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act have terminated or early
release under the Act has been obtained.



12.3 _Closing_. __The Closing of the transactions contemplated herein and the
transfer of the Assets shall occur on or before August 6, 2004 at Seller
s office, 1111 Bagby, Houston, Texas, at 10:00 a.m., local time, or such
other date, time, and place as Seller and Buyer may agree in writing (the

Agreement shall (i) provide for a fee payable to Seller of $330,000.00 per
month for each production month from August 2004 through October 2004, (ii)
limit Sellers liability for errors or omissions to cases of gross negligence
or intentional misconduct, and (iii) include the following general categories
of services (some of which may be discontinued prior to the end of the
Transition Period by mutual agreement):

additional services shall be provided at a mutually agreeable fee.



(e) Seller shall prepare and Seller and Buyer shall execute at Closing
transfer orders or letters-in-lieu in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer
for each purchaser or remitter of proceeds from the Leases, Wells and Units.

38 (g) On or before Closing, Seller shall, where Buyer is to become operator,
supply Buyer with an appropriate governmental form as required by the
governmental agency, board or commission having jurisdiction and authority to
change the name of operator from Seller to Buyer, for each Seller-operated
Well (whether dry, inactive, injector or producing), Lease or any other well
or facility or Personal Property, as may be required or defined by said
agency, board or commission, located on the premises that form a part of the
subject matter of this Agreement. All such forms shall be executed by Buyer
and/or Seller as may be required prior to or during Closing. Buyer shall be
responsible for any fee as may be required by such governmental agency, board
or commission and, at the parties option, shall either deliver its check
payable to the governmental agency, board or commission to Seller at Closing
or credit this fee amount to Seller in the applicable Final Settlement
Statement. Seller shall mail the completed form and fee to the proper

of the parties.



12.5 _Remedies Upon Termination_. __ If Buyer, through no fault of Seller,
fails, refuses, or is unable for any reason not permitted by this Agreement to
close the sale as described herein, Seller may, at its option, assert its
right of specific performance, declare the Deposit forfeited and retain same
or pursue any other rights or remedies to which it may be entitled, at law or
in equity. If this Agreement (i) is terminated by either Buyer or Seller under
Sections 8.2 or 14.3, (ii) is terminated by Seller due to the failure of a
Condition Precedent listed in subsections (b) or (d) of



 

39 Section 12.1, or (iii) is terminated by Buyer due to the failure of a
Condition Precedent listed in subsections (a), (b), (c) or (d) of Section

if any, to Buyer and neither party shall have any further liability whatsoever
to the other party pursuant to this Agreement. If Seller, through no fault of
Buyer, fails or refuses for any reason not permitted by this Agreement to
close the sale as described herein, Buyer may, at its option, assert its right
of specific performance, or waive such right and receive a refund of the
Deposit. 



12.6 _Final Adjustments_. __Within six months after the end of the Transition
Period provided for in the Transition Services Agreement executed as provided
in Section 12.3 (e), Seller shall prepare a settlement statement (the "First
Tier Fields Final Settlement Statement") for the Fields listed on Schedule
12.6 (the "First Tier Fields") setting forth, as to such First Tier Fields,
any adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for in Section 2.4 and not made
prior to or at Closing, any updates or corrections to previously-
made adjustments, and any other adjustments arising pursuant to this
Agreement. Within one year after the end of the Transition Period provided for
in the Transition Services Agreement executed as provided in Section 12.3 (e),
Seller shall prepare a settlement statement (the "Remaining Fields Final
Settlement Statement") for all remaining Fields covered hereby, setting forth,
as to such remaining Fields any adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for
in Section 2.4 and not made prior to or at Closing, any updates or
corrections to previously-made adjustments, and any other adjustments arising
pursuant to this Agreement. Additionally, in preparing each Final Settlement
Statement, Seller may include as a set off any resulting amount due to Buyer
against any amount or sum that Buyer may otherwise owe to Seller under the
terms of this Agreement.



Seller shall submit each Final Settlement Statement to Buyer on or before the
date established above, along with copies of third party vendor invoices in
excess of $10,000.00 each, or other evidence of expenses agreed to by Buyer
and Seller. Buyer shall respond in writing with objections and proposed
corrections within 90 days after receiving each Final Settlement Statement. If
Buyer does not respond to a Final Settlement Statement by signing or
objecting in writing within the 90-day period, the statement will be deemed
approved by Buyer. After approval of a Final Settlement Statement, Seller will
send a check or invoice to Buyer for the net amount. If Buyer and Seller are
unable to agree to all adjustments within 90 days after Buyers receipt of a
Final Settlement Statement submitted by Seller, adjustments which are not in
dispute shall be paid by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, at the
expiration of such 90-day period. Adjustments which remain in dispute, if
Buyer and Seller are unable to agree within 120 days after Seller provides a
Final Settlement Statement to Buyer, shall be resolved as provided in Section
13. Within 5 business days after final resolution of the dispute, Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, shall promptly make cash payment to the other
equal to the sum as may be found to be due. Nothing in this Section shall
limit any right of either party to assert a claim for revenues or
reimbursement after Buyers receipt of the applicable Final Settlement
Statement, and in this regard (i) should any party receive revenues to which
the other is entitled, such party shall pay over such revenues to the
appropriate party within 30 days after receipt thereof, and (ii) should any
party pay for costs or expenses for which the other party is responsible, such
party shall reimburse the other party within 30 days after the date the
responsible party receives an invoice for such costs and expenses.



 

40 13\. _Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration_



13.1 _Sole and Exclusive Method for Resolution of Disputes_. __Any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved in accordance
with the procedures specified in this Section 13, which shall be the sole and
exclusive procedures for the resolution of any such disputes.



13.2 _Negotiation Between Executives_. __The parties shall attempt to resolve
any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement promptly by
negotiation between executives who have authority to settle the controversy
and who are at a higher level of management than the persons with direct
responsibility for administration of this Agreement. Either party may give
the other party written notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal
course of business. Within 15 days after delivery of the notice, the receiving
party shall submit to the other a written response. The notice and response
shall include (a) a statement of that party s position and a summary of
arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of the
executive who will represent that party and of any other person who will
accompany the executive. Within 30 days after delivery of the initial notice,
the executives of both parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and
place, and thereafter continue to meet as often as they reasonably deem
necessary, to attempt to resolve the dispute. All negotiations pursuant to
this clause are confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement
negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence.



13.3 _Mediation_. __If the dispute has not been resolved by negotiation as
provided herein within 60 days after delivery of the initial notice of
negotiation, or if the parties failed to meet within 30 days after delivery of
such notice, the parties shall endeavor to settle the dispute by mediation
under the CPR Mediation Procedure then currently in effect. Unless
otherwise agreed, the parties will select a mediator from the CPR Panels of
Distinguished Neutrals.



13.4 _Arbitration_. __Any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including the breach, termination or validity thereof, which has
not been resolved by mediation as provided herein within 45 days after
initiation of the mediation procedure, shall be finally resolved by
arbitration in accordance with the CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration
then currently in effect, three independent and impartial arbitrators, none of
whom shall be appointed by either party; provided, however, that if one party
fails to participate in either negotiation or mediation as agreed herein, the
other party can commence arbitration prior to the expiration of the time
periods set forth above. The place of arbitration shall be Houston, Texas.
The arbitrators are not empowered to award damages in excess of compensatory
damages and each party expressly waives and foregoes any right to punitive,
exemplary or similar damages. The arbitration shall be governed by the
Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§116, and judgment upon the award rendered
by the arbitrators may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof.



 

41 14\. _Miscellaneous_



 

14.1 _Oil and Gas Imbalances_. __The adjustments described in Section 2.4.1
and 2.4.2 are not applicable to oil and gas production, pipeline or
other imbalances as hereafter described, whether or not a gas or oil delivery
balancing agreement is in effect. Instead, such imbalances will be handled as
set forth in this Section 14.1 and in Section 2.4.3.



(a) _Production Imbalances_. "Production Imbalances" are defined as over-
production or under-production with respect to oil or gas produced from or
allocated to the Assets where Seller as of the Effective Date is out of
balance with the operator or with other working interest parties in the
Assets. As to Production Imbalances, and regardless of whether Seller is
over-produced or under-produced as to its share of total oil, condensate or
gas production, any balancing obligation or credit arising from such over- or
under-production balance as of the Effective Date shall transfer to Buyer on
the Effective Date, and Seller shall have no further liability therefor nor
benefit therefrom (whichever the case may be), and as of the Effective Date,
Buyer expressly assumes any such obligation or credit. If Seller is a party
to an oil or gas balancing agreement or other reconciliation obligations
pursuant to any operating agreement or commingling authority covering all or a
portion of the Assets, Buyer shall assume all rights and duties of
Seller pursuant thereto. If the Assets are not covered by a balancing
agreement or other reconciliation obligations pursuant to any operating
agreement or commingling authority, Buyer shall fulfill its obligations under
this provision in accordance with applicable law. Buyer agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold Seller and Seller Parties harmless against any and all losses,
Claims, suits and liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of Buyers
failure to fulfill its obligations under this provision.



(b) _Imbalances on Agreements Assigned to Buyer_. Any oil or gas imbalances
existing as of the Effective Date on gathering, transportation or processing
agreements assigned to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (the "Assigned
Agreement Imbalances"), regardless of whether Seller is long or short, shall
transfer to Buyer on the Effective Date and Seller shall have no further
liability therefor nor benefit therefrom (whichever the case may be) and as of
the Effective Date Buyer expressly assumes any such long or short Assigned
Agreement Imbalance. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller and
Seller Parties harmless against any and all losses, Claims, suits and
liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of Buyers failure to fulfill
its obligations under this provision.



(c) _Other Imbalances_. All oil or gas imbalances existing as of the
Effective Date on Sellers gathering, transportation or other agreements that
are not assigned to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (the "Other Imbalances"),
regardless of whether Seller is long or short, shall remain the
responsibility of Seller, and Buyer shall have no liability therefor nor
benefit therefrom (whichever the case may be). Seller agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold Buyer and Buyer Parties harmless against any and all losses,
Claims, suits and liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of Sellers
failure to fulfill its obligations under this provision.



 

42 (d) _Adjustment Methodology for Buyer-Assumed Imbalances_. The following
adjustments shall be made to account for the Production Imbalances and the
Assigned Agreement Imbalances (the "Buyer-Assumed Imbalances") transferred to
and assumed by Buyer:



 

(i) Seller shall set forth in the Closing Statement, based on the best
information available to Seller at the time the Closing Statement is prepared,
Sellers best estimate of the aggregate Buyer-Assumed Imbalances as of the
Effective Date. Such estimate shall form the basis of the Purchase Price
adjustment to be made pursuant to Section 2.4.3 hereof.



(ii) If it shall be determined prior to conclusion of the Final Adjustments as
set forth in Section 12.6 that the aggregate Buyer-Assumed Imbalances as of
the Effective Date actually varied from the estimated aggregate Buyer-Assumed
Imbalances set forth on the Closing Statement, the following adjustment shall
be made:



(A) If the actual aggregate Buyer-Assumed Imbalances as of the Effective
Date varied from the estimated aggregate Buyer-Assumed Imbalances set forth
on the Closing Statement to the detriment of Seller, then Seller shall pay
Buyer the product of the Agreed Imbalance Settlement Price as defined in
Section 2.4.3 and the entire amount of such variance; or



(B) If the actual aggregate Buyer-Assumed Imbalances as of the Effective Date
varied from the estimated aggregate Buyer-Assumed Imbalances set forth on the
Closing Statement to the benefit of Seller, then Buyer shall pay Seller the
product of the Agreed Imbalance Settlement Price as defined in Section 2.4.3
and the entire amount of such variance,



and each Party hereby expressly waives any other remedies. For purposes of
this Section 14.1 (d), one "Mcfe" shall be equal to one-sixth of a barrel of
oil or condensate.



14.2 _Insurance_. __With regard to any Seller-operated properties:



(a) Seller and Buyer acknowledge that insurance coverage for the Assets and
the operations in which the Assets have been used has been provided, in part,
under insurance programs arranged and maintained by ChevronTexaco Corporation
for itself and its subsidiaries and affiliates (such policies are herein
called "ChevronTexaco Policies").



(b) Seller and Buyer agree that, as of the Closing Date, all of
the ChevronTexaco Policies shall cease to apply to the Assets and the
operations in which the Assets are used and that Buyer shall make no claims
under the ChevronTexaco Policies with respect to any matter whatsoever,
whether arising before or after the Closing Date.



(c) In the event that any Claim is hereafter made under or with respect to
any of the ChevronTexaco Policies by or through Buyer or any person subrogated
to its rights, Buyer shall indemnify and defend Seller and the Seller Parties
against and shall hold them harmless from



 

43 such Claim and all costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys
fees and court costs) related thereto.



14.3 _Casualty Loss of Assets_.



14.3.1 _Definition_. __"Casualty Loss" means physical damage to any of the
physical Assets that (a) occurs between execution of this Agreement and
Closing, (b) is not the result of normal wear and tear, mechanical failure or
gradual structural deterioration of materials, equipment and
infrastructure, downhole failure (including: (i) failures arising or
occurring during drilling or completing operations; (ii) junked or lost holes;
or (iii) sidetracking or deviating a well) or reservoir changes; and (c)
exceeds One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars. 



14.3.2 _Notice of Loss_. __Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of all
instances of Casualty Loss that occur and become known to Seller between the
date of this Agreement and Closing.



14.3.3 _Handling of Casualty Loss_. __If, prior to Closing, a portion of the
Assets is damaged or destroyed by a Casualty Loss, Seller and Buyer shall
meet to attempt to agree on an adjustment to the Purchase Price reflecting the
"Reduction in Value" of the Assets because of such Casualty Loss. For this
purpose, "Reduction in Value" is based on the principle that Seller should
generally bear the costs of repairing the Assets to the state existing
immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, but if such repair results in
equipment or facilities that are newer than or upgraded from that which
existed immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, Buyer should bear a portion
of such costs that is equitable under the circumstances because of the benefit
to Buyer of such newer or upgraded equipment or facilities. Except as to those
real property Assets with a negative Buyer s Allocation, no adjustment
associated with a Casualty Loss shall exceed Buyers Allocation for the
affected Asset. For any real property Asset with a negative Buyers
Allocation, Buyer may give Seller written notice at least 5 business days
prior to Closing and exclude from this Agreement the real property Asset
subject to the Casualty Loss and increase the Purchase Price by an amount
equal to Buyers negative Allocation for such real property Asset. If the
Parties are unable to agree on resolution of a Casualty Loss, the Parties
shall proceed to Closing with the Purchase Price being reduced by Sellers
estimate of the Reduction in Value of the Assets as a result of the Casualty
Loss; provided, however, either Party may, within 60 days after the Closing
Date (but not later), initiate binding arbitration in accordance with Section
13.4 to resolve the dispute, without any necessity to first engage in
negotiations or mediation. Any claim for a Casualty Loss not referred to
arbitration within 60 days after Closing shall be deemed waived. Seller shall
retain any and all insurance proceeds and other payments associated with or
attributable to any pre-Closing Casualty Loss which has been remedied by
Seller or for which a Purchase Price adjustment has been made. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the aggregate Casualty Losses and Asset exclusions under
this Section exceed ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price, either Party may,
by written notice to the other at least 5 days prior to Closing, terminate
this Agreement. If either party exercises its option to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 14.3, this Agreement shall become void and
have no effect, Seller shall promptly return the Deposit to Buyer (exclusive
of interest earned), and neither party shall have any further right or duty to
or claim against the other party under this Agreement, except as expressly
provided to the contrary in this Agreement. 



 

44 14.4 _Transfer of Records_. __With the exception of books of account, tax
returns and correspondence relating thereto, technical and interpretive data
excluded from this sale, any documents of overall significance to Seller s
business and all of the Excluded Assets, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, at
Closing or within a reasonable time thereafter, the Records.



14.5 _Publicity_. __Seller and Buyer shall consult with each other with
regard to all press releases or other public or private announcements made
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and except
as may be required by applicable laws or the applicable rules and regulations
of any governmental agency or stock exchange, neither Buyer nor Seller shall
issue any such press release or other publicity without the prior written
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Except
as may be required by applicable laws or the applicable rules and regulations
of any governmental agency or stock exchange, no press release of either party
shall include any reserve estimates without the prior written consent of the
other party, which consent may be withheld at the sole discretion of such
party.



14.6  _Assignment_. __Prior to Closing, Buyer may not assign any rights
acquired hereunder or delegate any duties assumed hereunder without the prior
written consent of Seller or its respective successors and assigns. After
Closing, Buyer may not sell, transfer, assign, sublease or delegate any
rights or interests acquired under this Agreement and the Assignment or
delegate any duties assumed thereunder without any such grantee, transferee,
assignee, sublessee or delegee having agreed in writing to be bound by all of
the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement and the Assignment, and
any such grantee, transferee, assignee, sublessee or delegee shall assume all
duties and obligations imposed on Buyer set forth herein and therein or
arising herefrom and therefrom; and any such transfer, assignment, sublease or
delegation shall so provide. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Buyer shall remain responsible to Seller for all obligations and
liabilities under this Agreement and under the Assignment.



14.7 _Entire Agreement_. __This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between Seller and Buyer with respect to the transactions contemplated herein,
and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements, commitments, and
understandings between the parties. No amendment of this Agreement shall be
binding unless in writing and signed by both parties. Headings used in this
Agreement are only for convenience of reference and shall not be used to
define the meaning of any provision. The parties and their counsel
participated jointly in the preparation of this Agreement, and there shall be
no presumption applied against either party in the interpretation of this
Agreement based upon such party s role in the drafting. This Agreement
is for the benefit of Seller and Buyer and their respective successors,
representatives, and assigns and not for the benefit of third parties.



14.8 _Notices_. __All notices and consents to be given hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered either by
personal delivery, telex, telecopy or similar facsimile means, by certified

Agreement does not occur for any reason, Buyer agrees that all information

the provisions of Section 14.7, nothing in this Section and this Agreement
shall have the effect, prior to Closing, of terminating, modifying or
superseding that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated December 9, 2003
between Buyer and Seller.



14.11 _Default_. __Seller shall notify Buyer in the event that Seller becomes
aware that Buyer or Buyer s successors or assigns have failed to satisfy one
or more post-Closing obligations assumed



 

46 by Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Assignments, and/or any
amendments thereto (any such failures hereinafter referred to as a
"Default"). Buyer shall correct or redress or respond to or begin to correct
or redress or respond to any Default within 30 days after receipt of such
written notice or such lesser or greater time as may be dictated by any
emergency situation or as required by applicable agreements or as required by
any law, order, rule or regulation of any governmental authority.



 

14.11.1 _Failure to Respond_. __If (i) within such time as defined

to correct or redress or respond to any Default, or (ii) after beginning such
efforts Buyer does not correct or redress such Default within a reasonable
amount of time and within the time required by any applicable agreements or
any law, order, rule or regulation of any governmental authority, or (iii)
Seller is unable to locate Buyer in order to notify Buyer after reasonable
efforts to do so, Seller, at its option, may endeavor to and shall be
authorized to plug and abandon well(s), remove facility(ies) or equipment or
restore the surface area(s), or otherwise correct such Default, or cause such
to be done. Seller shall exercise reasonable discretion and endeavor to
accomplish only that necessary to remedy such Default, all at the entire
cost, risk and expense of Buyer, except that Buyer shall not be responsible
for costs and expenses of any such work done by Seller or Seller s affiliates
in excess of amounts typically charged by unaffiliated third parties for like
or similar services in the area. Compliance with the Notices requirements
under this Agreement shall be considered as sufficient notice to Buyer

no event be obligated to satisfy any Default by Buyer or its successors or
assigns.



14.11.3 _Invoicing and Recoupment by Seller_. __Within a reasonable period of

salaries, legal costs, permits, penalties, interest, and other losses and
expenses incurred for or by Seller for the purpose of correcting
or redressing such Defaults.



14.11.4 _Other Remedies Reserved_. __Seller s right to proceed in the manner
above described to correct or redress Defaults of Buyer or its successors or
assigns is not intended to be nor shall it limit or be exclusive of any other
right or remedy, whether personal or in "rem", available to Seller under this
Agreement, the Assignments, and/or any amendments thereto, or otherwise by
law, all of which remedies are expressly and fully ratified, granted to and
reserved to Seller.



14.12 _Survival of Certain Obligations_. __Representations and warranties
in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of this Agreement (but not the disclaimers and
waivers contained elsewhere in Section 5) shall terminate as of December 31,
2005; and thereafter no action may be commenced either in court or disputes
brought to arbitration based on breach of those representations and
warranties, without prejudice to the right to recovery in connection with
actions or disputes commenced in the appropriate forum on or before December

Buyer or Seller, and obligations of indemnity and defense contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing indefinitely and shall be binding upon
each party and their respective successors and assigns.

Agreement are strictly prohibited. Each party, for itself and for its
respective directors, partners, employees, and agents warrants, covenants and

partners, employees or agents, any commission, fee, rebate, gift or other
thing or service in connection with this Agreement. Likewise, neither Buyer
nor any director, employee or agent of Buyer shall enter into any business
relationship with any director, employee or agent of Seller (or of any
affiliate of Seller), unless such person is acting for and on behalf of
Seller, without prior written notification thereof to Seller. Buyer and
Seller each agree that its books and records shall be subject to reasonable
audit by the other as may be required to substantiate compliance with this
provision.



14.14 _Further Cooperation_. __After the Closing, each party shall
execute, acknowledge, and deliver all documents, and take all such acts which
from time to time may be reasonably requested by the other party in order to
carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. Additionally, prior to
the end of the Transition Period as set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement executed as provided in Section 12.3 (e) (and to the extent such
information has not already provided to Buyer during Buyer s due diligence
review or has changed since first being provided), Seller shall provide Buyer
in electronic format (a) payment decks and division of interest information,
(b) a summary of upcoming rentals due with respect to the Leases, and (c) any
other accounting files in Sellers possession that Buyer will require to
manage its ownership and operation of the Assets. Seller shall not be liable
for any inadvertent errors or omissions in any files or information so
provided to Buyer and Buyer agrees to use and rely on such files or
information at its sole risk.



14.15 _Counterparts_. __This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts with the same effect as if all signatures of the parties hereto
were on the same document, but in such event each counterpart shall constitute
an original, and all of such counterparts shall constitute one Agreement; but
in making proof of this Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or
account for more than one such counterpart signed by each party.



14.16 _Exhibits and Schedules_. __All of the Exhibits and Schedules referred
to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference
and constitute a part of this Agreement.



14.17 _Severability_. __If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, all other
conditions and provisions of the Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any materially adverse
manner to the other party.



 

48 14.18 _Expenses, Post-Closing Consents and Recording_. __Notwithstanding other
provisions of this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for the filing and
recording of the Assignment(s), conveyances or other instruments required to
convey title to the Assets to Buyer in the appropriate federal, state and
local records, and all required documentary, filing and recording fees and
expenses incurred in connection therewith. Buyer shall supply Seller with a
true and accurate photocopy of all the recorded and filed Assignments(s)
within a reasonable period of time after such are available. Buyer shall
be responsible for timely obtaining all consents and approvals of
governmental entities or authorities customarily obtained subsequent to
transfer of title and all costs and fees associated therewith. Except as
otherwise specifically provided, all fees, costs and expenses incurred by
Buyer or Seller in negotiating this Agreement or in consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring the same, including, without limitation, legal and accounting fees,
costs and expenses.



14.19 _Nominations and Accounting Responsibilities_. __Except as otherwise
provided in the Transition Agreement referenced in Section 12.3 (d), from the
first day of the first production month following Closing, Seller is relieved
of all responsibility for, and Buyer will (a) bear, and commence payment of,
all burdens, fees and taxes on or relating to the Assets, and (b) perform all
nomination, marketing, accounting, royalty payment, reporting, and other
administrative responsibilities relating to the Assets. 



14.20 _Removal of Signs and Markers_. __Seller may either remove its name and
signs from the Seller-operated Wells, facilities and Personal Property or
require Buyer, at Buyer s cost, to do so for those Assets that Buyer will
operate. If Sellers name or signs remain on the Assets after Seller ceases to
be operator and Buyer has become operator, Buyer shall (a) remove any
remaining signs and references to Seller within 45 days after Seller ceases to
be operator or such earlier time as may be required by applicable regulations,
(b) install signs complying with applicable governmental regulations,
including signs showing Buyer as operator of the Assets it operates, and (c)
notify Seller of the removal and installation. Seller reserves a right of
access to the Assets after it ceases to be operator to remove its signs and
name from all Wells, facilities and Personal Property, or to confirm that
Buyer has done so for the Assets operated by Buyer. If Seller removes signs
because Buyer has not done so, Seller will charge its costs to Buyer either
in the applicable Final Settlement Statement or by separate invoice, which
Buyer agrees to pay within 15 days after receipt thereof.



14.21 _CONSPICUOUSNESS / EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE_. __THE DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION
AND HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, SECTIONS 1.8, 3.3.2, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.3.6, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
5.3.3, 7.3 (a), (b) and (c), 7.4, 7.5, 7.7, and 14.2(c), SHALL BE APPLICABLE
WHETHER OR NOT THE DAMAGES, LOSSES, INJURIES, LIABILITIES, COSTS OR EXPENSES
IN QUESTION AROSE SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE ACTIVE, PASSIVE OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF DUTY (STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), OR
OTHER FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY, OR FROM ANY PRE-EXISTING DEFECT. BUYER
AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS
NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.



 

49 14.22 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. __Each Party irrevocably waives and agrees
not to seek indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages of any
kind in connection with any dispute arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the breach hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 14.22
does not diminish or otherwise affect the parties  rights and obligations to
be indemnified against, and provide indemnity for, indirect, consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages awarded to any third party for which
indemnification is provided in this Agreement or Sellers right to receive
liquidated damages, including the Deposit, pursuant to the provisions of
Section 12.5. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in
this Agreement, Sellers cumulative indemnity obligations to Buyer and the
Buyer Parties under this Agreement shall not exceed the Purchase Price.



14.23 _Prior Contract(s) Affecting Production_. __All or a portion of the
natural gas and other hydrocarbons produced from the Assets covered hereby has
heretofore been committed to the gas contracts, crude oil
pipeline commitments, and other contracts listed on Schedule 14.23.
Therefore, during the life of said identified contracts and any successor or
replacement contract(s) thereto, none of the natural gas and other
hydrocarbons produced from the Assets subject to said contracts(s) shall be
committed to any other contract in contravention of said identified contracts,
and insofar as they pertain to the interest acquired by Buyer in the Assets,
Buyer hereby agrees to comply with and perform the duties and obligations
imposed upon Seller under said identified contracts. The foregoing restriction
shall not apply if Buyer obtains from the other party thereto a release of the
gas or other hydrocarbons from the aforementioned identified contracts,
or successor, or replacement contracts thereto.



14.24 _Disclosure of Royalty Valuation Claims, Demands and/or Lawsuits_.
__The Leases to be assigned hereunder may be subject to various claims,
demands or lawsuits alleging underpayment of royalty or severance taxes based
upon Seller s use of the posted price of crude oil in the calculation and
payment of royalty or severance taxes on oil. If the Leases are subject to any
such claims, demands or lawsuits, Seller shall retain liability therefor with
respect to events occurring prior to the Effective Date. Settlement
agreements and/or judgments entered in such lawsuits may affect the manner in
which royalty or severance taxes on oil produced from the Leases are paid
after the Effective Date, and Buyer agrees to comply fully with the terms of
such settlement agreements and/or judgments insofar as they affect the
Leases, but Seller shall not, without Buyers prior written consent, enter
into any settlement agreement after the date of this Agreement that would (a)
reduce the net revenue interest accruing to Buyer in any Lease after the
Closing Date, or (b) voluntarily increase the severance tax rate applicable to
any Lease. Seller hereby notifies Buyer, and Buyer hereby acknowledges, that
the Leases to be assigned herein may be subject to the royalty and
severance/production tax claims, demands, lawsuits, and/or investigations
identified on Schedule 3.3.5.



14.25 _Settlement Agreement_. __Buyer acknowledges and agrees that all or a
portion of the Leases may be subject to and affected by the terms and
agreements contained in that certain Settlement Agreement executed by Chevron
et al on May 29, 1997 in the class action lawsuit entitled The State of Texas
et al v. Amoco Production Co. et al No. 95-08680, 345th Judicial District,
Travis County, Texas. Under the terms of that Settlement Agreement, Chevron
is obligated, in the



 

50 absence of an outright sale at the lease, to value oil and condensate for
royalty and overriding royalty payments using the formulas contained in
Section 1.25 of the Settlement Agreement. Said Settlement Agreement was
approved on August 20, 1997 by Final Judgment of said Court. Buyer agrees to
abide by the terms of Sections 1.12, 1.25, 2.8 and 6.6 of the said Settlement
Agreement (Referenced Sections) and further agrees that the Referenced
Sections shall be binding upon Buyer, its successors and assigns. Any future
conveyance of the Leases shall specifically reference and describe
Buyers obligations as set forth in this Section 14.25 and bind Buyers
successors and assigns. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has provided the
Referenced Sections to Buyer and that Buyer has read and fully understands the
Referenced Sections. Buyer further agrees to require its successors and
assigns to acknowledge in their conveyance of the Leases that Buyer has
provided such successors and assigns with the Referenced Sections and that
such parties have read and fully understand the Referenced Sections.



14.26 _Cooperation by Seller (Buyer s Audit)_. __Seller agrees that it will
provide Buyer revenue and expense information (lease operating statements and
lease operating cost reports), detailed to the Level 6 accounting codes, for
the Assets for the calendar year 2003 and the production months of January
through June 2004, as well as year-end information for calendar year 2003 and
year-to-date information for the first six months of 2004. The aforementioned
information for calendar year 2003 shall be provided no later than June 15,
2004, and the information for the January through June 2004 period shall be
provided no later than June 30, 2004 (using estimated data if actual data is
not yet available, to be updated when the actual data is available). During
the period from execution of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Seller
will also allow Buyer s independent auditors reasonable access upon prior
written notice to supporting records, invoices and other source documents
insofar as required to verify to the reasonable satisfaction of such auditors
the revenue and expense information provided by Seller as set forth above;
provided, however, that Seller will provide only such data as it has in its
possession and shall not be obligated to generate such data in any particular
form or format.



Wherefore, the parties, intending to be legally bound by all of the terms and
provisions hereof, have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly-
authorized representatives as of the date first above written.
