formation, or presence of NORM, asbestos or other hazardous substances in or on the Assets shall, after the Effective Date set forth herein, be the sole responsibility of Buyer, and Buyer and all future assignees and successors of Buyer shall
defend, indemnify and hold Seller and the Seller Parties harmless from any and all Claims resulting from any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, liens, judgments, settlements, suits, causes of action, fines, penalties, fees (including,

asbestos or other hazardous substance was in place before or after the Effective Date. Any conveyance, transfer or assignment of all or part of the Assets by Buyer, its successors or assigns, in which the grantee, transferee or assignee fails to
expressly assume this obligation shall be deemed null and void. Accordingly, lands and/or water bottoms, the Wells, and the Personal Property transferred herein are transferred with the restriction that they will be used only in connection with oil
and gas producing activities associated with the Leases, and will not be subsequently transferred by Buyer or Buyer&#146;s assignee for unrestricted use unless the concentrations of NORM, asbestos or other hazardous substances associated therewith
are independently determined by a competent laboratory and are found below the levels specified as allowable for unrestricted transfer as set forth in any and all applicable laws, orders, rules or regulations of any governmental agency or court
having jurisdiction. Additionally, Buyer agrees to comply with all provisions of such laws, orders, rules or regulations applicable to said lands and/or water bottoms, the Wells, and the Personal Property. Buyer further agrees to cause the

the Casualty Loss, Buyer should bear a portion of such costs that is equitable under the circumstances because of the benefit to Buyer of such newer or upgraded equipment or facilities. Except as to those real property Assets with a negative

either Party may, within 60 days after the Closing Date (but not later), initiate binding arbitration in accordance with Section 13.4 to resolve the dispute, without any necessity to first engage in negotiations or mediation. Any claim for a
