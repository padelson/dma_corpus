subject to transfer restrictions and, as a result of these transfer
restrictions, Subscriber may not be able to readily resell the Acquired Shares

covenants and agreements included in this Subscription Agreement.

Acquired Shares will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended, Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, or any applicable similar law.

 



4 h. In making its decision to purchase the Acquired Shares, Subscriber
represents that it has relied solely upon independent investigation made by
Subscriber. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Subscriber has received
such information as Subscriber deems necessary in order to make an investment
decision with respect to the Acquired Shares, including with respect to the
Company, the Seller, the Hostess Business and the Transaction. Subscriber
represents and agrees that Subscriber and Subscribers professional
advisor(s), if any, have had the full opportunity to ask such questions,
receive such answers and obtain such information as Subscriber and such

and the Company. Subscriber did not become aware of this offering of the
Acquired Shares, nor were the Acquired Shares offered to Subscriber, by any
other means. Subscriber acknowledges that the Company represents and warrants
that the Acquired Shares (i) were not offered by any form of general
solicitation or general advertising and (ii) are not being offered in a manner
involving a public offering under, or in a distribution in violation of, the
Securities Act, or any state securities laws.

j. Subscriber acknowledges that it is aware that there are substantial risks
incident to the purchase and ownership of the Acquired Shares. Subscriber has
such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Acquired
Shares, and Subscriber has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as
Subscriber has considered necessary to make an informed investment decision.

 

k. Alone, or together with any professional advisor(s), Subscriber represents
and acknowledges that Subscriber has adequately analyzed and fully considered
the risks of an investment in the Acquired Shares and determined that the
Acquired Shares are a suitable investment for Subscriber and that Subscriber
is able at this time and in the foreseeable future to bear the economic risk
of a total loss of Subscribers investment in the Company. Subscriber
acknowledges specifically that a possibility of total loss exists.

 

l. Subscriber understands and agrees that no federal or state agency has
passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the Acquired Shares or
made any findings or determination as to the fairness of this investment.

required by applicable law, provided that Subscriber is permitted to do so
under applicable law. Subscriber represents that if it is a financial
institution subject to the Bank Secrecy Act (31 U.S.C. Section 5311 et seq.)
(the " _BSA_ "), as amended by the USA

 



5 PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the " _PATRIOT Act_ "), and its implementing regulations
(collectively, the " _BSA/PATRIOT Act_ "), that Subscriber maintains policies
and procedures reasonably designed to comply with applicable obligations under
the BSA/PATRIOT Act. Subscriber also represents that, to the extent required,
it maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed for the screening of
its investors against the OFAC sanctions programs, including the OFAC List.

maintains policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the
funds held by Subscriber and used to purchase the Acquired Shares were legally
derived.

 

5\. _Registration Rights_. The Company agrees that, within thirty (30)
calendar days after the consummation of the Transaction, the Company will
file with the SEC a registration statement registering the resale of the
Acquired Shares (the " _Registration Statement_ "), and the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof;
_provided, however_ , that the Companys obligations to include the Acquired
Shares in the Registration Statement are contingent upon Subscriber furnishing
in writing to the Company such information regarding Subscriber, the
securities of the Company held by Subscriber and the intended method of
disposition of the Acquired Shares as shall be reasonably requested by the
Company to effect the registration of the Acquired Shares, and shall execute
such documents in connection with such registration as the Company may
reasonably request that are customary of a selling stockholder in similar
situations.

 

6\. _Termination_. This Subscription Agreement shall terminate and be void and
of no further force and effect, and all rights and obligations of the parties
hereunder shall terminate without any further liability on the part of any
party in respect thereof, upon the earlier to occur of (a) such date and time
as the Transaction Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (b)
upon the mutual written agreement of each of the parties hereto to terminate
this Subscription Agreement or (c) if any of the conditions to Closing set
forth in Section 2 of this Subscription Agreement are not satisfied on or
prior to the Closing and, as a result thereof, the transactions contemplated
by this Subscription Agreement are not consummated at the Closing; _provided_
, that nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful
breach hereof prior to the time of termination, and each party will be
entitled to any remedies at law or in equity to recover losses, liabilities or
damages arising from such breach. The Company shall promptly notify Subscriber
of the termination of the Transaction Agreement promptly after the
termination of such agreement.

7\. _Trust Account Waiver_. Subscriber acknowledges that the Company is a
blank check company with the powers and privileges to effect a merger, asset
acquisition, reorganization or similar business combination involving the
Company and one or more businesses or assets. Subscriber further acknowledges
that, as described in the Companys prospectus relating to its initial public
offering dated August 13, 2015 (the " _Prospectus_ ") available at
www.sec.gov, substantially all of the Companys assets consist of the
cash proceeds of the Companys initial public offering and private placements
of its securities, and substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited
in a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") for the benefit of the
Company, its public shareholders and the underwriters of the Companys
initial public offering. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds
held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its tax
obligations, if any, the cash in the Trust Account may

 



6 be disbursed only for the purposes set forth in the Prospectus. For and in
consideration of the Company entering into this Subscription Agreement, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Subscriber, on
behalf of itself and its Representatives, hereby irrevocable waives any and
all right, title and interest, or any claim of any kind they have or may have

this Agreement.
