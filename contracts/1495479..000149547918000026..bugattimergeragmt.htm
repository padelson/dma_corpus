If a &#13;&#10;Dissenting Holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses any such rights as a &#13;&#10;Dissenting Holder under the OGCL, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such &#13;&#10;event, whichever later occurs, and upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares &#13;&#10;representing the Company Common Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, such holder&#8217;s &#13;&#10;Company Common Shares will automatically be converted into and represent only the right to &#13;&#10;receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, and will no longer be Dissenting Shares.  No &#13;&#10;Dissenting Holder shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such &#13;&#10;Dissenting Holder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder&#8217;s rights under Section &#13;&#10;1701.85 of the OGCL (through failure to perfect or otherwise), and any Dissenting Holder shall &#13;&#10;be entitled to only such rights as are provided by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL with respect to &#13;&#10;Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Holder.  If any Person who otherwise would be &#13;&#10;deemed a Dissenting Holder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder&#8217;s rights under &#13;&#10;Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (through failure to perfect or otherwise) or if a court of competent &#13;&#10;jurisdiction shall finally determine that the Dissenting Holder is not entitled to the relief provided &#13;&#10;by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares &#13;&#10;shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenting Shares had been converted, as of the &#13;&#10;Effective Time or as of the time of such withdrawal or loss of such holders&#8217; rights under 1701.85 &#13;&#10;of the OGCL (through failure to perfect or otherwise), whichever later occurs, into the right to &#13;&#10;receive the Merger Consideration.

In no event shall the exercise by &#13;&#10;one or more Dissenting Holders of demands for appraisal pursuant to the OGCL give rise to a &#13;&#10;right to terminate this Agreement.

In &#13;&#10;satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.11(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be &#13;&#10;obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the amount paid by the Company for &#13;&#10;coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 250% amount, the &#8220;Maximum Annual Premium&#8221;).  If &#13;&#10;the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the &#13;&#10;Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for &#13;&#10;a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or &#13;&#10;better credit rating as the Company&#8217;s current directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance carrier.  In &#13;&#10;lieu of maintaining the insurance coverage described in the first sentence of this Section 5.11(c), &#13;&#10;the Company may (or, if the Parent requests, the Company will) purchase, for effectiveness on &#13;&#10;the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid &#8220;tail&#8221; policy on terms and conditions providing equivalent &#13;&#10;or greater benefits as the current policies of directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance and &#13;&#10;fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to &#13;&#10;matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions.  If &#13;&#10;such &#8220;tail&#8221; prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the &#13;&#10;Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause such &#13;&#10;policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term.   &#13;&#10;(d) Parent shall or shall cause to be paid all reasonable and documented expenses, &#13;&#10;including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing &#13;&#10;the indemnity, advancement and other obligations provided in this Section 5.11. &#13;&#10;(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in &#13;&#10;limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the Articles of &#13;&#10;incorporation or code of regulations or other organizational documents of the Company or any of &#13;&#10;its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification arrangement or &#13;&#10;otherwise.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations under this &#13;&#10;Section 5.11 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any &#13;&#10;Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party. &#13;&#10;(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective &#13;&#10;successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the &#13;&#10;continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all &#13;&#10;or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper &#13;&#10;provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, &#13;&#10;as the case may be, shall assume in writing the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11. &#13;&#10;Section 5.12.
