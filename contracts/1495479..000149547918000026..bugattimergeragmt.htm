March 7, 2018 (the "Agreement"), by and among Bugatti Parent, Inc., a

the meanings set forth in Section 8.17. RECITALS WHEREAS, it is proposed
that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with

and subject to the conditions and limitations of the Ohio General Corporation
Law (the "OGCL") and this Agreement; WHEREAS, the board of directors of each
of Parent and Merger Sub has unanimously (a) determined that the Merger is
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and Merger Sub, as
the case may be; and (b) approved and adopted this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger, in accordance with the OGCL; WHEREAS,
the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has (a) determined
that the Transactions, including the Merger, are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders, (b) approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, and (c) on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, resolved to recommend that the
Company Shareholders adopt this Agreement and approve the Transactions in

those conditions) is satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement or
at such other place and time or on such other date as Parent and the Company
may agree in writing. Section 1.3. Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, the
Company and Parent will cause a certificate of merger with respect to the
Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Ohio, as provided in the OGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio, or at such later
time and date as may be agreed by the parties hereto in writing and set forth
in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the OGCL (the "Effective
Time"). Section 1.4. Surviving Corporation Articles of Incorporation. At the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, which are attached hereto as Exhibit

therein or by applicable Law, except that references to the name of Merger
Sub shall be replaced by the name of the Company. Section 1.5. Surviving
Corporation Code of Regulations. At the Effective Time, the code of
regulations of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
which is attached hereto as Exhibit B, shall be the code of regulations (the

death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and the Code of Regulations, and each of the parties to this
Agreement shall take all requisite action, if any, required so that the

 ![](bugattimergeragmt007.jpg) 

3 ARTICLE II CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES Section 2.1.
Effect on Share Capital. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub, the following will
occur: (a) Conversion of Common Shares. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 2.1(b), each common share of the Company, no par value (each, a
"Company Common Share"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive $4.05 in cash, without interest thereon
and subject to any applicable taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(ii)
(the "Merger Consideration"). Each Company Common Share to be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section
2.1(a) shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of share certificates representing Company Common Shares (the
"Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares") which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Shares other
than, (i) in the case of the Company Common Shares (other than Dissenting
Shares and Excluded Shares), the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, the Merger
Consideration and (ii) in the case of the Dissenting Shares, the rights set
forth in Section 2.1(e). (b) Treasury Shares; Parent and Merger Sub-Owned
Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
Company Common Share held by the Company as a treasury share or owned by any
of the Company's direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries or owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Excluded
Shares") shall be canceled automatically and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in respect of the Excluded Shares. (c)
Conversion of Merger Sub Share Capital. Each common share, no par value, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable common share, no par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. (d) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding
Company Common Shares shall occur as a result of a reclassification,
recapitalization, reorganization, share split (including a reverse share
split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share
dividend or share distribution (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Shares) or other similar change
with respect to the Company Common Shares with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change and such adjustment shall provide the Company's shareholders the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action;
provided, that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit
the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other Person to take any
action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 5.1).  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt008.jpg) 

4 (e) Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary and to the extent required by the OGCL, any Company Common
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any shareholder who was a record holder of Company
Common Shares as to which such shareholder seeks relief as of the date fixed
for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, and who delivers to the Company, in accordance with
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, a written demand for payment of the fair cash
value for such Company Common Shares prior to the Company Shareholders
Meeting and for such Company Common Shares that have not been voted in favor
of the proposal to adopt this Agreement at the Company Shareholders Meeting
(the "Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, unless and until such Dissenting Holder fails to
perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses any such rights as a
Dissenting Holder under the OGCL, and such Dissenting Holder will be entitled
to only such rights as are granted to holders of Dissenting Shares by the
OGCL. If a Dissenting Holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses any such rights as a Dissenting Holder under the OGCL, then as of
the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs,
and upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing the
Company Common Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, such holder's Company
Common Shares will automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, and will no
longer be Dissenting Shares. No Dissenting Holder shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such Dissenting Holder
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's rights under Section
1701.85 of the OGCL (through failure to perfect or otherwise), and any
Dissenting Holder shall be entitled to only such rights as are provided by
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares owned by such
Dissenting Holder. If any Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting
Holder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's rights under
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (through failure to perfect or otherwise) or if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall finally determine that the Dissenting
Holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL
with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon
be treated as though such Dissenting Shares had been converted, as of the
Effective Time or as of the time of such withdrawal or loss of such holders'
rights under 1701.85 of the OGCL (through failure to perfect or otherwise),
whichever later occurs, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
The Company will give Parent prompt written notice (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days) of, and copies of all correspondence from, each
shareholder who asserts rights as a Dissenting Holder following receipt of
such shareholder's written demand delivered as provided in Section 1701.85 of
the OGCL, or withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the OGCL and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Shares. In no event shall the exercise by one or more
Dissenting Holders of demands for appraisal pursuant to the OGCL give rise to
a right to terminate this Agreement. Parent shall have the right to direct
and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
actions in respect of any Company shareholder's rights in respect of
Dissenting Shares; provided, that prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
consult with the Company and consider in good faith the Company's advice with
respect to such negotiations and proceedings and the Company shall have the
right to participate in any such negotiations and proceedings. The Company
may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and prior to the
Effective Time, Parent may not, except with the prior written consent of the
Company (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in
respect of Dissenting Shares.  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt009.jpg) 

5 Section 2.2. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Fund. At least one (1)
Business Day prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be
appointed by Parent (and reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as a
paying agent hereunder (the "Paying Agent"), in trust for the benefit of
holders of Company Common Shares, cash in U.S. dollars that is sufficient in
the aggregate for the Paying Agent to make the payments of the aggregate
Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Company Common Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Dissenting Shares and Excluded shares), payable upon due surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II (such cash in the aggregate and any proceeds thereon being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). In the event any Dissenting Shares cease
to be Dissenting Shares, prior to the termination of the Exchange Fund
pursuant to Section 2.2(d), Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent in the Exchange Fund, an amount equal to the product of
(i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of such formerly
Dissenting Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall, or shall
cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit additional
funds with the Paying Agent in an amount sufficient to make such payments.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly
provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that (i) any
investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to (A) direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government or any agency or
instrumentality thereof, (B) in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively, (C) in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available), or (D) money market funds investing
solely in a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no instrument
shall have a maturity exceeding three months and (ii) no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the former holders of
Company Common Shares pursuant to this Article II. (b) Payment Procedures.
(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the third (3rd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Common Shares (other
than Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares) whose Company Common Shares were
converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss together with any
required bond or indemnity in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of Company Common
Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Parent shall require the
paying agent agreement to  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt010.jpg) 

6 provide that the Paying Agent deliver such letter of transmittal and
instructions not later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time.
Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss together with
any required bond or indemnity in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent, including by the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of
the surrender of any Company Common Shares held in book entry on a book-entry
statement, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may customarily and reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss together
with any required bond or indemnity in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive from the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an
amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the number of Company Common
Shares represented by such holder's properly surrendered Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied
by (B) the Merger Consideration. The Certificate so surrendered will be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss together with any
required bond or indemnity in lieu thereof) or Book- Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, or if the consideration
payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates
surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company, payment upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Company Common Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable share transfer and other applicable Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall
not be required to deliver a Certificate to the Paying Agent to receive the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article II. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry
Shares shall automatically, upon compliance with this Section 2.2(b)(i), be
entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter),
from the Exchange Fund an amount in cash equal to the product of (A) the
number of such holder's Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (B) the Merger
Consideration. The Merger Consideration, paid in full with respect to any
Company Common Share in accordance with the terms hereof, shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Common Share. (ii) The Paying Agent, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent
and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement Taxes that are required to
be withheld or deducted with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld
amounts (A) shall be remitted by the applicable entity to the appropriate
Governmental Entity and (B) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in good faith
in requesting and providing any information or documentation allowing for the
reduction or elimination of any such deduction and withholding. (c) Closing
of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Company Common Shares that were  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt011.jpg) 

7 outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, the holder of any such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be given a copy of the letter of
transmittal referred to in Section 2.2(b) and instructed to comply with the
instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II.
(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon its demand, and any holders of
Company Common Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not surrendered their
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss together with any required bond
or indemnity in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this
Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of
their Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss together with any required
bond or indemnity in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, in each case subject
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. (e) No Liability.

delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law, and any such amounts will be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Company Common
Shares. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have not been surrendered
immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. (f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In
the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable and
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the
product of the number of Company Common Shares formerly represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration
(without interest). Section 2.3. Treatment of Company Options and Company
Restricted Shares. (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company
Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled without any action on the part of the
holder thereof in consideration for the right of such holder to receive,
without interest, a cash payment (less required withholding Taxes and
deductions pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(ii)) with respect thereto equal to the
product of (i) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option (the "Option Cash
Payments");  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt012.jpg) 

8 provided, that each Company Option with an exercise price per share that is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled with no
payment due to the holder thereof. As of the Effective Time, all Company
Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically terminate and
cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash
Payment, if any, in respect thereof. The Surviving Corporation shall, and

Company Options the Option Cash Payments as promptly as practicable, and in
all events within three (3) Business Days, following the Effective Time. (b)
Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share, shall be
canceled without any action on the part of the holder thereof in consideration
for the right of such holder to receive, without interest, a cash payment
(less required withholding Taxes and deductions pursuant to Section
2.2(b)(ii)) equal to the Merger Consideration (the "Restricted Share Cash
Payments"). The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of Company Restricted Shares the
Restricted Share Cash Payments as promptly as practicable, and in all events
within three (3) Business Days, following the Effective Time. (c) Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions and take such
other actions as may reasonably be necessary to effectuate the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.3. (d) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Option Cash Payments and the Restricted Share
Cash Payments shall be processed through the regular payroll account of the
Company following receipt of such amounts from Parent, and the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall pay to the applicable recipient of
such payment such amount (less required withholding Taxes and deductions
pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(ii)) in full payment thereon. ARTICLE III

non- binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may become
payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the
consummation of the Merger. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Company Shareholders entitled to vote at the Company
Shareholders Meeting, and comply with all legal requirements applicable to the
Proxy Statement and the Company Shareholders Meeting. Subject to Section 5.5,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to submit this Agreement
for adoption by the Company Shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting
and obtain the Requisite Company Vote. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn, recess,
reconvene or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting if (x) after
consultation with Parent, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
it is required by applicable Law to postpone or adjourn the Company
Shareholders Meeting to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company Shareholders within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Shareholders Meeting or
(y) after consultation with Parent, if as of the time for which the Company
Shareholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient Company Common Shares present (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Shareholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company Shareholders Meeting will
not be postponed or adjourned with respect to clause (y) of this Section 5.3,
by more than 30 calendar days after the date on which the Company
Shareholders Meeting was (or was required to be) originally scheduled.
Section 5.4. Access; Confidentiality. (a) Subject to compliance with
applicable Laws, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its
and its Subsidiaries' respective officers, directors, employees and
representatives to, afford to Parent and Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
financial advisors and agents and other representatives (collectively,
"Parent Representatives"), upon written request, reasonable access during
normal business hours, during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective
Time and the Termination Date, to the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
officers and employees, properties, Contracts, facilities, tax records, books
and records. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required
to afford such access if it (i) would unreasonably disrupt the operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) would violate any of the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' obligations under any Contract with respect to
confidentiality that was entered into prior to the date of this Agreement so
long as the Company shall have used reasonable efforts to obtain the consent
of the counterparty in such Contract to such access or disclosure, (iii) is  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt038.jpg) 

34 subject to any attorney-client privilege to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (so long as the Company uses its reasonable best efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not
result in a loss of such privilege, or (iv) reasonably be expected to result
in a violation of any applicable Law. (b) Parent hereby agrees that all
information provided to it, Merger Sub or any Parent Representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions shall
be deemed to be Evaluation Material, as such term is used in, and shall be
treated in accordance with the non-disclosure agreement, dated as of November
6, 2017, between the Company and GP Investments, Ltd. (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). Section 5.5. Acquisition Proposals. (a) Except as expressly
permitted by this Section 5.5, promptly following the date of this Agreement
(i) the Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations with, and terminate any data room
access (or other access to diligence) of, any Person and its directors,
officers, Affiliates, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
and other advisors, agents or representatives (collectively,
"Representatives") relating to an Acquisition Transaction and (ii) the Company
will request that each Person (other than Parent and its Representatives)
that has, prior to the date of this Agreement, executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring the Company to,
in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement, promptly
return or destroy all non-public information furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this
Agreement. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.5, from the date
of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, and the Company shall direct and cause its
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
propose, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any inquiry or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to, or provide any non-public information or data concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books, records or any personnel of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
designees) relating to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or
recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) enter into any acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar definitive agreement, or any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle, or any other agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from the date
of this Agreement until the Company's receipt of the Requisite Company Vote,
if the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited Acquisition Proposal from any
Person that was not received as a result of a breach of Section 5.5(a), the
Company and its Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the terms
and conditions thereof and (i) the Company and its Representatives may provide
information (including any non-public information) regarding, and afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and personnel of,
the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person pursuant to an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms as to confidentiality that are no
less favorable to the Company in the aggregate than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement");
provided that the Company shall (x) promptly (but in any event within 24
hours) notify Parent of the receipt of any  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt039.jpg) 

35 Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, and deliver to
Parent unredacted copies of any documents received in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal, (y) promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent of any material developments with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, and (z) contemporaneously make available to Parent and Merger Sub
any confidential information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that
is provided to any Person given such access that was not previously made
available to Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) following the execution of an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may
engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with such Person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, if
and only to the extent that prior to taking any action described in clauses
(i) or (ii) above, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and that the failure
to take the actions contemplated by this Section 5.5(b) would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law. (c) Except as set forth
in this Section 5.5(c), following the date of this Agreement the Company
Board shall not (i) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or
publicly propose or resolve to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Recommendation, (ii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend to the Company Shareholders, an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within 10 Business Days of the
occurrence of a material event or development and after Parent so requests in
writing (or, if the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled to be held
within 10 Business Days, then within one Business Day after Parent so
requests in writing), or (v) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of
Capital Stock of the Company that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is
commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer by the Company Shareholders (including, for these purposes, by
disclosing that it is taking no position with respect to the acceptance of
such tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders, which shall
constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer, provided that a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act shall not be prohibited), within ten (10) Business
Days after commencement thereof (any of the foregoing, a "Change of
Recommendation"), or authorize, adopt, approve or propose to authorize, adopt
or approve, an Acquisition Proposal, or cause or permit the Company to enter
into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company Board may (A) effect a
Change of Recommendation if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, (x) as a result of a
development or Effect that occurs or arises after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement (other than a Superior Proposal or Effect that otherwise
relates to an Acquisition Proposal) that was not known to, or reasonably
foreseeable by, the Company Board prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (an "Intervening Event"), and (y) failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law or
(B) if the Company receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law, terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.4(a) and enter into, the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement associated with such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that:  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt040.jpg) 

36 (i) the Company Board may only take the actions described in the foregoing
clause (A) if: (1) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to
Parent of the Company Board's intention to take such actions at least three
(3) Business Days in advance of taking such action, which notice shall
describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; (2) after providing
such notice and prior to taking such actions, the Company shall have, and
shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such three (3) Business Day
period, to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that would cause the Company Board to no longer believe that it
would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable
Law not to effect the Change of Recommendation, and by 5:00 PM Eastern Time
on the last Business Day of such three (3) Business Day and the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel,
that it would continue to reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to effect the Change of
Recommendation, if such changes offered in writing by Parent were given
effect; and (ii) the Company Board may only take the actions described in the
foregoing clause (B) if: (1) the Company shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent of the Company Board's intention to take such actions at
least three (3) Business Days in advance of taking such action (or two (2)
Business Days in the case of any material modification of a Superior Proposal
that is the subject of a prior notification under this clause), which notice
shall specify, as applicable, the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal
received by the Company that could reasonably result in a Superior Proposal,
including a copy of the most current version of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with, and the identity of, the party making the
Acquisition Proposal and other material documents (including any financing
commitments with respect to such Acquisition Proposal); (2) after providing
such notice and prior to taking such actions, the Company shall have, and
shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such three (3) Business Day
or two (2) Business Day period, as the case may be, to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would cause the Company
Board to no longer believe that it would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law not to
effect the Change of Recommendation; (3) the Company Board shall have
considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement or other arrangements
that may be offered in writing by Parent by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on the last
Business Day of such three (3) Business Day or two (2) Business Day period,
as the case may be, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that (i) Parent
has not made an offer that is at least as favorable, taken as a whole, to the
Company Shareholders as such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the bona fide
Acquisition Proposal received by the Company would continue to constitute a
Superior Proposal, in each case, if such changes offered in writing by Parent
were given effect; and  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt041.jpg) 

37 (4) the Company pays the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
procedures set forth in Section 7.6. (d) Nothing contained in this Section
5.5 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company, the Company Board or any
committee of the Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to shareholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-
listen" communication to the Company Shareholders under the Exchange Act (or
any similar communications to the Company Shareholders) within ten (10)
Business Days after commencement of any tender offer; provided, however, that
any such disclosure or communication that constitutes or contains a Change of
Recommendation shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.5(c). (e) The
Company agrees that any action taken by a Representative of the Company at
the direction of the Company (other than an employee or consultant of the
Company who is not an executive or other officer of the Company and was not
otherwise directed to take such action by the Company) that, if taken by the
Company, would constitute a material breach of this Section 5.5 will be
deemed to constitute a breach by the Company of this Section 5.5. (f) As used
in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or
offer made by any Person (other than the Parent or Merger Sub) for (i) a
merger, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization
or similar transaction involving the Company (other than the Merger), (ii)
the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of twenty percent (20%) or
more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, or (iii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any Person of twenty
percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the outstanding Company Common
Shares, including any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more
of the voting power of the outstanding Company Common Shares. (g) As used in
this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal (with the percentages set forth in the definition of such term, to
the extent applicable, changed from 20% to 50%) that did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.5 and that the Company Board has determined in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor) would, if consummated, be more favorable, from a financial
point of view, to the Company Shareholders (in their capacity as such) than
the Merger, taking into account among other things all of the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including the financing, likelihood
and timing of consummation of the transaction contemplated by such
Acquisition Proposal) and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms
of this Agreement committed to by Parent to the Company in writing in response
to such Acquisition Proposal under the provisions of Section 5.5(c)).
Section 5.6. Employee Matters. (a) For a period of one year following the
Effective Time (but not beyond the termination of the applicable individual's
employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries), Parent shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to each individual that is an employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Continuing Employee"), (i) a base salary or hourly wage and bonus
opportunities (excluding for such purposes any equity-based compensation,
change in control payments, or retention or similar  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt042.jpg) 

38 payments) that are at least equal to those that were provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits (excluding for such purposes any equity-based compensation, change
in control payments, or retention or similar payments) that are at least as
favorable in the aggregate, to either (A) the compensation and benefits that
were provided to such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B)
the compensation and benefits that are provided to an employee of Parent or
an affiliate thereof (other than the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) in a similar position. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in the event that the employment of any Continuing Employee is
terminated during the one-year period following the Effective Time, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to provide, to such Continuing Employee severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits to which such Continuing Employee would
have been entitled under the applicable Company Benefit Plan disclosed on
Section 5.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time. (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.6(a),
for all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate,
and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Affiliates providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective
Time (the "New Plans"), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a similar Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated, and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision, disability and/or life
benefits to any Continuing Employee (or his or her covered dependents)
(collectively, the "Parent Welfare Plans"), Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) cause all pre- existing condition exclusions and
limitations, waiting requirements and actively-at-work requirements of such
Parent Welfare Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents, and (B) cause all eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the corresponding
Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year of such Company
Benefit Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee's participation in
the corresponding Parent Welfare Plan begins (such initial plan year of
participation, the "Initial Year of Participation") to be credited under such
Parent Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, copayment,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the Initial Year of
Participation as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent
Welfare Plan. (c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control,"
"change in control," "approved sale" or similar phrase within the meaning of
the Company Benefit Plans, will occur at or prior to the Effective Time, as
applicable. (d) From and after the Effective Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their
terms, provided that nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the
amendment or termination of any of the foregoing in accordance with its terms.
(e) It is expressly acknowledged, understood and agreed that nothing in
Sections 5.6(a)-(d) or otherwise contained in this Agreement is intended to or
does or shall  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt043.jpg) 

39 constitute an amendment to or establishment of any Company Benefit Plan,
New Plans or any employee benefit or other plan or, subject to the express
provisions of this Section 5.6, shall prevent the amendment or termination of
any such plan. Nothing in this Section 5.6 shall be deemed to (i) be a
guarantee to any Continuing Employee of employment or, without limiting the
express provisions of this Section 5.6, any specific term or condition of
employment, (ii) create any right or benefit in any person other than the
signatories of this Agreement, or (iii) preclude the ability of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee.
Section 5.7. Efforts; Consents and Approvals. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use
its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and
regulations or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Transactions as
promptly as practicable, including (i) causing the conditions to the Merger
set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, approvals, and
expirations or terminations of waiting periods, including the Company
Approvals and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making
of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance or waiver from, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity (all of the
foregoing, collectively, the "Governmental Consents"), (iii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from, and delivering of all
necessary notifications to, third parties (including pursuant to any Material
Contracts and Real Property Leases so as to seek to maintain and preserve the
benefits to the Surviving Corporation of such Material Contracts and Real
Property Leases as of and following the consummation of the Transactions),
(iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other Actions, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions and (v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the Transactions; provided that in no
event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior
to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third
party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of the
Transactions under any contract or agreement. (b) Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided and without limiting the foregoing, the Company
and Parent shall cooperate with each other in (i) determining whether any
filings are required to be made with, or Governmental Consents are required to
be obtained from, any Governmental Entities (including in any foreign
jurisdiction in which the Company or its Subsidiaries are operating any
business) and (ii) to the extent not made prior to the date hereof, timely
making or causing to be made all such applications and filings as reasonably
determined by Parent and the Company as promptly as practicable. Each party
shall supply as promptly as practicable such information, documentation,
other material or testimony that may be requested by any Governmental Entity,
any other Governmental Consent and any such other applicable Laws for
additional information, documents or other materials received by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries from the Federal Trade
Commission or the Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Entity in
connection with such applications or filings or the Merger. (c) The Company
hereby agrees that from the date of this Agreement through the Closing, the
Company shall remain in compliance with the terms and conditions contained in
the Credit Agreement (as may be further amended), and shall not permit to
occur or suffer to exist an  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt044.jpg) 

40 Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement), including as a
result of entering into this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, in each case that is not waived by the lenders pursuant to the
Credit Agreement prior to the Closing. Section 5.8. Takeover Statute. Each of
the Company, the Company Board, Parent and Merger Sub will use their
reasonable best efforts to ensure that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to the Transaction. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the Transactions after the date of this Agreement, the Company
and the Company Board shall each use its reasonable best efforts to grant
such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize, to
the extent possible, the effects of such Takeover Statute on the
Transactions. Section 5.9. Notification of Certain Matters. At all times
during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article VII and (2) the Effective Time, (A) the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any notice or
other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement or the Merger, or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent and (b) any Transaction Litigation, (B) the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub of (i) any change,
condition, circumstance or event (including any renewal, termination, or
amendment of, or any proposed modification to, any Material Contract) that
results or could reasonably be expected to result in the Company failing to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement (including any
condition set forth in Article VI); or (ii) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which,
would cause or result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article VI not being satisfied or satisfaction of those conditions being
materially delayed and (C) Parent will give prompt notice to the Company upon
becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger
Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only
to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the Merger set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) to fail to
be satisfied at the Closing. No notification under this Section 5.9 will
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the Merger or the remedies
available to the parties hereto under this Agreement. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to any information provided
to Parent, Merger Sub or Company, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 5.9.
Section 5.10. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company agree to issue a
joint press release announcing this Agreement that is reasonably acceptable
to the Company and Parent. Thereafter, the Company, one the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to consult with and provide each other the opportunity
to review and comment upon any press release or other public statement or
comment, prior to the issuance of such press release or other public
statement or comment relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and shall
not issue any such press release or other public statement or comment prior
to such consultation except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations imposed by any national securities exchange or as may be
requested by a Governmental Entity; provided, that the restrictions in this
Section 5.10 shall not apply to any Company communication regarding an
Acquisition Proposal or a Change of Recommendation  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt045.jpg) 

41 (subject to any applicable terms of Section 5.5). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Affiliates may provide
ordinary course communications regarding this Agreement and the Transactions
to existing or prospective general or limited partners, equity holders,
members, managers and investors of such Person. Section 5.11.
Indemnification and Insurance. (a) The Surviving Corporation, Parent and
Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries
as provided in their respective Articles of incorporation or code of
regulations or other organizational documents or in any agreement with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth on Section 5.11(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and provided to Parent prior to the date hereof, and
such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company's and
any of its Subsidiaries' Articles of incorporation and code of regulations or
similar organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors or officers as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time set forth on Section 5.11(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter and provided to Parent prior to the date hereof,
and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals
who at the Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and
stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this Section 5.11. (b) For a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
Indemnified Parties) each current and former director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such Person's heirs,
executors or administrators, an "Indemnified Party") against any reasonable
and documented costs or expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Losses") in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, litigation, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
brought by or pending before any Governmental Entity (an "Action"), arising
out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or
alleged to have occurred whether before, at or after the Effective Time in
connection with such Indemnified Party's service as a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or acts or omissions in connection
with such Indemnified Party's service as officer or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries), including, without limitation, an Action arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time. In the event of any such Action, (A) the Surviving Corporation
will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time,
(B) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel
(the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of which will be paid by the
Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to
control the defense of any such Action, (C) upon receipt of an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification, the Surviving Corporation will advance
all fees and expenses (including  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt046.jpg) 

42 reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) as incurred by an Indemnified
Party in the defense of such Action, whether or not the Surviving Corporation
elects to control the defense of any such Action, (D) no Indemnified Party
will be liable for any settlement of such Action effected without his or her
prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages
for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). (c) For a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect
the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time. In
satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.11(c), the Surviving
Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of
the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
(such 250% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the Surviving
Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier. In lieu of
maintaining the insurance coverage described in the first sentence of this
Section 5.11(c), the Company may (or, if the Parent requests, the Company
will) purchase, for effectiveness on the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid
"tail" policy on terms and conditions providing equivalent or greater
benefits as the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the Transactions. If such "tail" prepaid policy
has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause
such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term.
(d) Parent shall or shall cause to be paid all reasonable and documented
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity, advancement and other
obligations provided in this Section 5.11. (e) The rights of each Indemnified
Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other
rights such Indemnified Party may have under the Articles of incorporation or
code of regulations or other organizational documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification
arrangement or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the obligations under this Section 5.11 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party
without the consent of such Indemnified Party. (f) In the event Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume in writing the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.11. Section 5.12. Financing Cooperation. (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its respective reasonable best efforts,
to provide Parent and Merger Sub with all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub or  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt047.jpg) 

43 the Financing Sources to assist them in causing any conditions in the Debt
Commitment Letters to be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub or the Financing Sources in connection with Parent and
Merger Sub obtaining the Debt Financing, including: (i) participating (and
causing senior management and Representatives of the Company to participate),
upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, in a
reasonable number of meetings, calls, presentations and due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions), otherwise cooperating with the
marketing efforts for the Debt Financing; (ii) promptly furnishing Parent
and the Financing Sources with the Required Information and other financial
and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, including financial information contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters and causing the Required Information to remain Compliant
and to continue to satisfy the applicable requirements set forth in the
definition of "Required Information"; (iii) assisting Parent and the
Financing Sources with the timely preparation of customary bank information
memoranda, lender presentations and similar documents required in connection
with the Debt Financing, including (solely with respect to financial
information and data derived from the Company's historical books and records),
reasonably assisting Parent with the preparation of pro forma financial
information and pro forma financial statements upon Parent's written request;
(iv) executing and delivering any definitive financing documents, including
pledge and security documents, guarantees, currency or interest hedging
arrangements and other certificates or documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or the Financing Sources and permitting evaluation of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral and the granting of security
interests in respect of the Debt Financing, it being understood that such
documents will not take effect until the Effective Time; (v) (A) deliver
notices of prepayment, effective as of the Closing, in a timely fashion as
required by the Credit Agreement and take any actions at or prior to the
Effective Time reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate such prepayment
(it being understood and agreed that any prepayment is (and shall be)
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing); and (B) arrange for customary
payoff letters, lien terminations and instruments and acknowledgements of
discharge (it being understood that no such lien terminations or and
discharges shall become effective until the Effective Time and the payoff of
the Credit Agreement) in respect of the Credit Agreement (the "Debt Payoff
Letters") to be delivered to Parent prior to the Closing Date (with drafts
being delivered in advance as reasonably requested by Parent), and take other
actions reasonably necessary to provide for the payoff and termination of the
Credit Agreement and related loan documents, and the termination and release
of liens thereunder concurrently with the Closing; (vi) providing
authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution
of information to prospective lenders and containing a customary
representation to the Financing Sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters; and  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt048.jpg) 

44 (vii) promptly furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources within two (2)
Business Days of any requests with all documentation and other information
about the Company and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested by Parent
relating to applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations. (b) Nothing in this Section 5.12 will require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or
agree to pay any fees or expenses prior to the Effective Time for which it
will not receive reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on
behalf of Parent; (ii) enter into any definitive agreement (other than
customary representation letters and authorization letters (including with
respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and the
accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing
materials related to the Debt Financing)) that is not contingent on the
occurrence of the Effective Time; (iii) give any indemnities in connection
with the Debt Financing that are effective prior to the Effective Time; (iv)
approve of the Financing prior to the Effective Time or (v) take any action
that, in the good faith determination of the Company, (a) would reasonably be
expected to conflict with or violate the organizational documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Law, (b) would unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (c)
create an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. In addition, no action,
liability or obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing (other
than customary representation letters and authorization letters (including
with respect to the presence or absence of material non-public information and
the accuracy of the information contained in the disclosure and marketing
materials related to the Debt Financing)) will be effective until the
Effective Time. (c) The Company consents to the customary and reasonable use
of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' logos solely in connection with any
Debt Financing or any alternative financing from alternative financing
sources ("Alternative Financing"); provided, that such logos are used solely
in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates. (d) The
Company hereby expressly authorizes the use of the financial statements and
other information provided hereunder for purposes of the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Financing and is not aware of any limitation on the use of such
financial statements required by any independent accountant. (e) Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in performing their
obligations under this Section 5.12, and indemnify the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and
other representatives for any and all Losses suffered or incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees and other representatives arising therefrom (other than
(i) as a result of information provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and
other representatives containing any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading
or (ii) to the extent arising from the bad faith, gross negligence, fraud or
willful misconduct of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their

collectively as the "Reimbursement Obligations"). Section 5.13. Transaction

participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation; (b) consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement
and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (c) consider in good faith
Parent's advice with respect to any Transaction Litigation. The Company may
not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to

Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in writing (which consent
shall be in Parent's sole discretion). Section 5.14. Stock Exchange

advisable hereto to cause the Transactions and any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Section 5.17.

or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Company's operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations. ARTICLE

representations and warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of
which shall be determined as of that specified date), unless the failure or
failures of such representations and warranties to be true and correct in all
respects would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. (b) Performance of Obligations.

all covenants and obligations of this Agreement required to be performed and
complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing. (c)

47 material respects, without regard to any "materiality" qualifications
contained therein, as though made on and as of the Closing Date (except for
representations and warranties made as of a specified date, the accuracy of
which shall be determined as of that specified date), unless the failure or
failures of such representations and warranties to be true and correct in all

the Merger or ability of Parent and Merger Sub to perform their respective

Company, Parent or Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set

party's failure to comply with or perform any of its covenants or obligations
set forth in this Agreement. ARTICLE VII TERMINATION Section 7.1.

any time prior to the Effective Time by mutual written consent of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company. Section 7.2. Termination by Either Parent or the

Agreement under this Section 7.2(a) shall not be available to any party to
this Agreement whose breach of any representations or warranties set forth in
this Agreement, or whose failure to fulfill any of its obligations hereunder,
has been a principal cause of, or primarily resulted in, (i) the failure to
consummate the Merger by the Termination Date or (ii) the failure to satisfy
the conditions to the obligations of the terminating party to consummate the
Merger set forth in Article VI prior to the Termination Date; (b) if this
Agreement has been submitted to the Company Shareholders for approval and
adoption at a duly convened Company Shareholders Meeting (or adjournment or

 ![](bugattimergeragmt052.jpg) 

48 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.2(c) or Section 7.2(d) will not be available to any
party that has failed to use its reasonable best efforts to resist, appeal,
obtain consent pursuant to, resolve or lift, as applicable, such Order,
statute, rule or regulation. Section 7.3. Termination by Parent. This
Agreement may be validly terminated by Parent at any time prior to the
Effective Time: (a) if the Company Board makes a Change of Recommendation or
the Company commits a Willful and Material Breach of its obligations under
Section 5.3 or Section 5.5; or (b) if the Company breaches or fails to
perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach (i) would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or Section
6.2 and (ii) is incapable of being cured by the Termination Date, or, if
capable of being cured by the Termination Date, has not been cured by the
Company within thirty (30) days after the Company's receipt of written notice
of such breach from Parent. Section 7.4. Termination by the Company. This
Agreement may be validly terminated by the Company at any time prior to the
Effective Time: (a) in accordance with Section 5.5(c); or (b) if Parent
breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its

the Termination Date, or, if capable of being cured by the Termination Date,
has not been cured by Parent within thirty (30) days after Parent's receipt of

the next sentence and except that no such termination shall relieve any party
of liability for (a) the Willful and Material Breach by any party to perform
its obligations, (b) the Willful and Material Breach by any party of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or (c) Fraud. The
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter,
this Section 7.5, and the provisions of Section 5.4(b) (Access;
Confidentiality), Section 5.10 (Public Announcements), Section 5.12(e)
(Reimbursement Obligations), Section 7.6 (Termination Payment) and Article
VIII (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their respective terms. Section 7.6. Termination Payments.
Any provision in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) The
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee:  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt053.jpg) 

49 (i) if this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.4(a), in which case the Company shall make such payment concurrently
with such termination; (ii) if this Agreement is validly terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(a), in which case payment shall be made within
three (3) Business Days of such termination; or (iii) if (A) an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made or proposed to the Company or otherwise
publicly announced (and is not withdrawn), (B) this Agreement is validly
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.2(b) or is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(b) and (C)
within twelve (12) months following the date of such termination, the Company
enters into a Contract for or relating to, or otherwise consummates any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal is the same
Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (A)), in which case payment shall
be made within three (3) Business Days of the date on which the Company
enters into such Contract or consummates such Acquisition Proposal. (iv)
Following receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee in accordance with
this Section 7.5, the Company shall have no further liability with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions to Parent or Merger Sub. (b) If this
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 7.2(b), then the Company
must concurrently with such termination pay or cause to be paid to Parent or
its designee an amount equal to that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Affiliates for all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions in an amount not to
exceed $1,087,000 (the "Parent Expenses") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent. To
the extent that Parent Expenses are paid and the Company Termination Fee is
subsequently due pursuant to Section 7.6(a)(iii), the amount of Parent
Expenses actually paid shall be deducted from the amount due pursuant to the
Company Termination Fee. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the parties agree that in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and
upon the occurrence of different events. (d) Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.6 are
an integral part of the Transactions, that the damages resulting from the
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination
Fee or Parent Expenses is or are payable are uncertain and incapable of
accurate calculation and that, without these agreements, the parties would
not enter into this Agreement, and, therefore, the Company Termination Fee
and the Parent Expenses, as applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to
this Section 7.6, shall not constitute a penalty, but rather liquidated
damages, and in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving
such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Merger. If the Company fails to promptly pay any amount
due pursuant to Section 7.6(a) or Section 7.6(b), as applicable, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences an Action that results in a
judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in  

  

 ![](bugattimergeragmt054.jpg) 

50 Section 7.6(a) or Section 7.6(b), as applicable, then the Company will pay
or cause to be paid to Parent reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) of Parent
in connection with such Action, together with interest on such amount or
portion thereof at an annual rate equal to the prime rate as published in The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion
thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment or portion
thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted
by applicable Law. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, but subject to Section 8.5 with respect to the enforcement of
the provisions of this Section 7.6, Parent's right to receive payment from
the Company of the Company Termination Fee to the extent owed pursuant to
this Section 7.6 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Financing Sources against the Company and its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited
partners, shareholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, Affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Company
Specified Persons") in respect of this Agreement and the Transactions or the
Financing Letters, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company
Specified Persons shall have any further monetary liability or obligation to
Parent, Merger Sub or the Financing Sources relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions, the Financing Letters or any ancillary
agreements contemplated hereby or thereby. ARTICLE VIII MISCELLANEOUS

to be governed by the Law of the State of Ohio. The parties to this Agreement
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State

Agreement, and in respect of the Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not
to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not
subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or
is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be

of a lack of personal jurisdiction) be enforced in or by such courts, and the
parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action

papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 8.9 or in such other manner as may be permitted by
applicable Laws, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. (b)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i) that any Action, whether at
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the
Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters, or the performance of services
thereunder or related will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any

itself and its property with respect to any such Actions to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Action in any
other court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in
the Debt Commitment Letters will be effective service of process against them
for any such Action brought in any such court; (iv) to waive and hereby

party agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other
party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement (including

satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof), the non-

decree or order of specific performance or other equitable relief to enforce
the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and (ii) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. If a non-breaching

award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity and (ii) no other party or any other Person shall be required
to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with
or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.5,
and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the

in connection with or related to this Agreement, the ancillary agreements
hereto or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement, the ancillary agreements hereto or their negotiation or execution;
and each party hereto or thereto waives and releases all such liabilities,
claims and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates; provided, for
the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 8.6 shall impact the Equity
Investor's obligations to fund the Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms
of the Equity Commitment Letter. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
Non-Party Affiliates are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section
