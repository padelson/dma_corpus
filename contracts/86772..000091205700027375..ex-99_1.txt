                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of May
25, 2000, is among Devon Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Devon"), Devon Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and a direct and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Devon ("Merger Co."), and Santa Fe Snyder
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Santa Fe Snyder").

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, Devon and Santa Fe Snyder have each determined to engage in
a strategic business combination with the other;

         WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the parties hereto desire that
Merger Co. merge with and into Santa Fe Snyder (the "Merger"), pursuant to
which each outstanding share of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock (as defined in
Section 3.1) will be converted into shares of Devon Common Stock (as defined
in Section 3.1);

         WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Devon, Merger
Co. and Santa Fe Snyder have determined the Merger, in the manner
contemplated herein, to be desirable and in the best interests of their
respective corporations and stockholders and to be consistent with, and in
furtherance of, their respective business strategies and goals, and, by
resolutions duly adopted, have approved and adopted this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Code");

         WHEREAS, it is intended that the Merger be accounted for as a
pooling of interests in accordance with APB Opinion 16 as amended by
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards and related interpretations of
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, and the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("Pooling of Interests");

         WHEREAS, as an inducement to the willingness of Santa Fe Snyder to
enter into this Agreement, Devon has granted Santa Fe Snyder an option to
purchase shares of Devon Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Option Agreement
(as defined in Section 3.1); and

         WHEREAS, as an inducement to the willingness of Devon to enter into

         Section 1.1 THE MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Co.
shall be merged with and into Santa Fe Snyder in accordance with this
Agreement, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Co. shall thereupon
cease. Santa Fe Snyder shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger and

the offices of McAfee & Taft A Professional Corporation, 10th Floor, Two
Leadership Square, 211 North Robinson Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, at
9:00 a.m., local time, on the first business day immediately following the
day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth
in Article 7 shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance herewith or (b) at
such other time, date or place as Devon and Santa Fe Snyder may agree. The
date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing
Date."

         Section 1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. If all the conditions to the Merger set
forth in Article 7 shall have been fulfilled or waived in accordance herewith
and this Agreement shall not have been terminated as provided in Article 8,
on the Closing Date, a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
meeting the requirements of Section 251 of the DGCL shall be properly
executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Secretary of State"). The Merger shall become effective at the time of
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State in accordance
with the DGCL, or at such later time that the parties hereto shall have
agreed upon and designated in such filing as the effective time of the Merger
(the "Effective Time").

         Section 1.4 CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS. After the Closing Date, the
corporate headquarters of Devon and the Surviving Corporation shall be
located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

         Section 1.5 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. The certificate of
incorporation of Santa Fe Snyder in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended and restated to duplicate the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Co., until duly amended in accordance with applicable
law, except that Article 1 of such certificate of incorporation shall state
as follows: "FIRST: The name of the corporation is Santa Fe Snyder
Corporation."

         Section 1.6 BYLAWS. The bylaws of Merger Co. in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
until duly amended in accordance with applicable law.

         Section 1.7 RESIGNATION OF SANTA FE SNYDER DIRECTORS. The Board of
Directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of the Board of
Directors of Merger Co., as it existed

                                       2
<PAGE>

immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each of the members of the Board
of Directors of Santa Fe Snyder shall tender his resignation, to be effective
immediately upon the Effective Time.

                                   ARTICLE 2

                               DIRECTORS OF DEVON

Section 2.1 DIRECTORS OF DEVON. At the Effective Time, the Board of Directors
of Devon shall consist of a number of persons as determined by Devon.
One-third (1/3) of the total number of directors, rounded to the nearest
whole number, shall be persons designated by Santa Fe Snyder who are
acceptable to Devon (the "Santa Fe Snyder Designees"). The Santa Fe Snyder
Designees shall be appointed to fill any vacancies on the Board of Directors
existing immediately prior to the Effective Time and then shall be allocated
as evenly as possible among the different classes of Devon directors. Devon
shall give written notice to Santa Fe Snyder by June 15, 2000 of the number
of directors which shall constitute the entire Board at the Effective Time.
Santa Fe Snyder shall have until June 30, 2000 to give Devon written notice
of Santa Fe Snyder's designees to serve as directors at the Effective Time.
The notice of designees shall include the information concerning each
designee as would be required to be included in a proxy statement under
Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act. If Devon reasonably determines that any
Santa Fe Snyder designee is unacceptable, Santa Fe Snyder and Devon will
agree upon a substitute designee not later than July 15, 2000. If, prior to
the Effective Time, any Santa Fe Snyder designee becomes unavailable or
unwilling to serve, Santa Fe Snyder shall designate a substitute designee
acceptable to Devon. If necessary to comply with this Section 2.1, Devon
shall cause to be presented to the meeting of its stockholders contemplated
by Section 6.4 of this Agreement a proposal to amend Devon's Certificate of
Incorporation to increase the number of directors that constitutes the entire
Board of Directors.

                                   ARTICLE 3

                       CONVERSION OF SANTA FE SNYDER STOCK

         Section 3.1 CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Agreement, the
following terms shall have the following meanings:

         (a) "Devon Common Stock" shall mean the common stock, par value $.10
per share, of Devon, and the rights under the Devon Rights Agreement.

         (b) "Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock" shall mean the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Santa Fe Snyder.

         (c) "Santa Fe Snyder Exchange Ratio" shall equal 0.22.

         (d) "Stock Option Agreements" shall mean (i) the Stock Option
Agreement dated the date hereof between Devon and Santa Fe Snyder pursuant to
which Devon has granted to Santa Fe Snyder an option to purchase a certain
number of shares of Devon Common Stock and (ii) the Stock Option Agreement
dated the date hereof between Santa Fe Snyder and Devon

                                       3
<PAGE>

pursuant to which Santa Fe Snyder has granted to Devon an option to purchase a
certain number of shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock.

         Section 3.2 CONVERSION OF SANTA FE SNYDER STOCK AND MERGER CO. STOCK.

         (a) At the Effective Time, each share of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock (x) held in Santa Fe Snyder's treasury or
(y) owned by Devon or any wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 9.15)
of Devon or Santa Fe Snyder) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the number of shares
of Devon Common Stock equal to the Santa Fe Snyder Exchange Ratio, subject to
adjustment as provided in Section 3.4. At the Effective Time, each share of
Merger Co. common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted into one share of Santa Fe Snyder Common
Stock.

         (b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each share of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock
(a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock, except that such Certificates shall
thereafter evidence (x) the number of whole shares of Devon Common Stock into
which such shares are converted pursuant to Section 3.2(a) and the right to
receive any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and (y) the right to
receive cash for fractional shares of Devon Common Stock in accordance with
Sections 3.3(b) and 3.3(e) upon the surrender of such Certificate.

         (c) (i) At the Effective Time, all options (individually, a "Santa Fe
Snyder Option" and collectively, the "Santa Fe Snyder Options") then outstanding
under the stock option plans of Santa Fe Snyder described in the Santa Fe Snyder
Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "Santa Fe Snyder Stock Option Plans") shall
remain outstanding following the Effective Time and cease to represent a right
to acquire shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock and shall be converted
automatically into options to purchase shares of Devon Common Stock as provided
in this Section 3.2(c). At the Effective Time, the Santa Fe Snyder Options
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Devon or the holder of any Santa Fe Snyder Option, be assumed by Devon in such
manner that Devon (A) is a corporation "assuming a stock option in a transaction
to which Section 424(a) applied" within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code
or (B) to the extent that Section 424 of the Code does not apply to any Santa Fe
Snyder Option, would be such a corporation were Section 424 of the Code
applicable to such option. Each Santa Fe Snyder Option assumed by Devon shall be
exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under the applicable Santa Fe
Snyder Stock Option Plan and the applicable option agreement issued thereunder,
except that (X) each Santa Fe Snyder Option shall be exercisable for that whole
number of shares of Devon Common Stock (rounded upward to the nearest whole
share) into which the number of shares of the Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock
subject to such Santa Fe Snyder Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
would be converted under Section 3.2(a) if such number of shares of Santa Fe
Snyder Common Stock was then outstanding and (Y), the option price per share of
Devon Common Stock shall be an amount


                                       4
<PAGE>

equal to the option price per share of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock subject to
such Santa Fe Snyder Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
divided by the Santa Fe Snyder Exchange Ratio, subject to adjustment as provided
in Section 3.4 (the price per share, as so determined, being rounded upward to
the nearest full cent).

         (ii) Devon shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a number of shares of Devon Common Stock equal to the number of shares
of Devon Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Santa Fe Snyder Options
assumed by Devon pursuant to this Section 3.2(c). From and after the date of
this Agreement, except as provided in Section 6.1(f), no additional options
shall be granted by Santa Fe Snyder or its Subsidiaries under the Santa Fe
Snyder Stock Option Plans or otherwise. At the Effective Time or as soon as
practicable, but in no event more than three business days thereafter, Devon
shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a
Registration Statement on Form S-8 covering all shares of Devon Common Stock to
be issued upon exercise of the Santa Fe Snyder Options and shall cause such
registration statement to remain effective for as long as there are outstanding
any Santa Fe Snyder Options.

         Section 3.3 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES REPRESENTING SANTA FE SNYDER
STOCK.

         (a) As of the Effective Time, Devon shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with BankBoston, N.A. or such other party reasonably satisfactory to
Devon and Santa Fe Snyder (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Article 3, certificates representing (i) the shares of Devon Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to Section 3.2 in exchange for outstanding shares of Santa Fe
Snyder Common Stock and (ii) cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3(b) and
3.3(e) (the "Exchange Fund").

         (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Devon shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates: (i) a letter
of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Devon and Santa Fe Snyder may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Devon
Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter of
Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (A) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Devon
Common Stock and (B) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to
the provisions of this Article 3, after giving effect to any required
withholding tax, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares and
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of Santa Fe Snyder, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Devon Common Stock, together with a
check for the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares, shall be issued to
such a transferee if the Certificate representing


                                       5
<PAGE>

such Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

         (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with
respect to Devon Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid with respect to the shares represented by any Certificate until such
Certificate is surrendered for exchange as provided herein. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Devon Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the
number of whole shares of Devon Common Stock into which the shares represented
by the Certificates are exchanged and not paid, less the amount of any
withholding taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Devon Common Stock, less
the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon.

         (d) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of Santa Fe Snyder of the shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Devon, the presented
Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for certificates for shares of
Devon Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Article 3.

         (e) No fraction of a share of Devon Common Stock will be issued, but in
lieu thereof each holder of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock otherwise entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Devon Common Stock will be entitled to receive
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3(e) from the Exchange Agent
a cash payment in lieu of the fraction of a share of Devon Common Stock equal to
the fraction multiplied by the average of the closing sales price (or, if the
securities should not trade on any trading day, the average of the bid and ask
prices therefor on that day) of Devon Common Stock as reported on the American
Stock Exchange (the "AMEX") during the five consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the Effective Date. As promptly as practicable after the determination
of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests,
the Exchange Agent will notify Devon, and Devon will deposit the necessary cash
with the Exchange Agent and will cause the Exchange Agent to forward payment to
the holders of fractional interests in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall, subject to any applicable abandoned
property or similar law, until one year after the Effective Date, pay to such
holders the cash value of such fraction so determined, without interest. Any
balance of such cash, as to which certificates representing Santa Fe Snyder
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not have
been surrendered by the expiration of such one-year period, shall thereafter be
returned to and held by Devon subject to any applicable statute of limitations
or any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof and any shares of Devon Common Stock) that remains unclaimed
by the former stockholders of Santa Fe Snyder one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Devon. Any former stockholders of Santa Fe Snyder who have
not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter look only to Devon
for payment of their shares of Devon Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional
shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on the Devon Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each Certificate such former stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement.

         (g) None of Devon, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

         (h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Devon, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Devon may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the shares of Devon Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional
shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Devon Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

         Section 3.4 ADJUSTMENT OF EXCHANGE RATIO. If, subsequent to the date of
this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, Santa Fe Snyder changes the
number of shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock, or Devon changes the number of
shares of Devon Common Stock, issued and outstanding as a result of a stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, the Santa Fe Snyder Exchange Ratio and other items dependent
thereon shall be appropriately adjusted.

         Section 3.5 RULE 16b-3 APPROVAL. Devon agrees that the Devon Board of
Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Devon Board of Directors shall,
at or prior to the Effective Time, adopt resolutions specifically approving, for
purposes of Rule 16b-3 ("Rule 16b-3") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the receipt, pursuant to Section 3.2, of Devon
Common Stock and Devon stock options by officers and directors of Santa Fe
Snyder who will become officers or directors of the Devon subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act.

<PAGE>

         Section 4.1 EXISTENCE; GOOD STANDING; CORPORATE AUTHORITY. Santa Fe
Snyder is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware. Santa Fe Snyder is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of any
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it
therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 9.9). Santa Fe Snyder has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business
as now conducted. The copies of Santa Fe Snyder's certificate of incorporation
and bylaws previously made available to Devon are true and correct and contain
all amendments as of the date hereof.

         Section 4.2 AUTHORIZATION, VALIDITY AND EFFECT OF AGREEMENTS. Santa Fe
Snyder has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements and all other agreements and
documents contemplated hereby, to which it is a party. The consummation by Santa
Fe Snyder of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Stock Option
Agreements has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action, other
than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of this Agreement by
Santa Fe Snyder's stockholders. This Agreement and the Stock Option Agreements
constitute the valid and legally binding obligations of Santa Fe Snyder to the
extent it is a party, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to creditors' rights and general principles of equity.

Snyder consists of 300,000,000 shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock, and
50,000,000 shares of Santa Fe Snyder preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share
("Santa Fe Snyder Preferred Stock"). As of May 24, 2000, there were (a)
183,035,836 shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock issued and outstanding
(including 40,000 shares of restricted stock to be granted to non-employee
directors, 20,000 shares of bonus stock to be granted to the non-employee
directors and 345,324 shares of restricted stock to be granted to James L.
Payne, all such shares to be issued as of May 16, 2000) and (b) no shares of
Santa Fe Snyder Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. All issued and
outstanding shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock (i) are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii)
were not issued in violation of the terms of any agreement or other
understanding binding upon Santa Fe Snyder and (iii) were issued in compliance
with all applicable charter documents of Santa Fe Snyder and all applicable

Agreement, except as set forth in this Section 4.3 or in the Stock Option
Agreements and except for any shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock issued
pursuant to the plans described in the Santa Fe Snyder Disclosure Letter, there
are no outstanding shares of capital stock and there are no options, warrants,
calls, subscriptions, convertible securities, or other rights, agreements or
commitments which obligate Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Santa
Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries. Santa Fe Snyder has no outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to

         Section 4.4 SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Significant Subsidiary" shall mean significant subsidiary as defined in Rule
1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act. Each of Santa Fe Snyder's
Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation or partnership duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (where applicable) under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the corporate or partnership
power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing (where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership, operation or lease of its property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to
be so qualified or to be in good standing would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of Santa Fe
Snyder's Significant Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable, and is owned, directly or indirectly, by Santa Fe Snyder free
and clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims, preferential
purchase rights or other rights, interests or encumbrances ("Liens"). Schedule
4.4 to the Santa Fe Snyder Disclosure Letter sets forth for each Significant
Subsidiary of Santa Fe Snyder, its name and jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization.

         Section 4.5 NO VIOLATION. Neither Santa Fe Snyder nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or has received notice that it would be with the passage of
time, in violation of any term, condition or provision of (a) its charter
documents or bylaws, (b) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license or other instrument or (c) any
order of any court, governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal, or
any law, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation to which Santa Fe Snyder or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is
subject, or is delinquent with respect to any report required to be filed with
any governmental entity, except, in the case of matters described in clause (b)
or (c), as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder
Material Adverse Effect. Santa Fe Snyder and its Subsidiaries hold all permits,
licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of all
governmental authorities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective
businesses (the "Santa Fe Snyder Permits"), except where the failure so to hold
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material
Adverse Effect. Santa Fe Snyder and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the
terms of the Santa Fe Snyder Permits, except where the failure so to comply
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material
Adverse Effect. No investigation by any governmental authority with respect to
Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of
Santa Fe Snyder, threatened, other than those the outcome of which would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 4.6 NO CONFLICT.

         (a) Neither the execution and delivery by Santa Fe Snyder of this
Agreement or the Stock Option Agreements nor the consummation by Santa Fe Snyder
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in accordance with the terms
hereof or thereof will: (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any
provisions of the charter documents or bylaws of Santa Fe Snyder; (ii) violate,
or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a
default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of
termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a


                                       9
<PAGE>

right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in
the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties of Santa Fe Snyder or its
Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void, voidable, or without
further binding effect, or otherwise result in a detriment to Santa Fe Snyder or
any of its Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit,
lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to
which Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Santa
Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or
affected; or (iii) contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any
provision of any law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding upon
or applicable to Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case
of matters described in clause (ii) or (iii), as would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Neither the execution and delivery by Santa Fe Snyder of this
Agreement or the Stock Option Agreements nor the consummation by Santa Fe Snyder
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in accordance with the terms
hereof or thereof will require any consent, approval or authorization of, or
filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory authority, other
than (i) the filings provided for in Article l and (ii) filings required under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or applicable state securities and
"Blue Sky" laws and applicable foreign competition or antitrust laws ((i) and
(ii) collectively, the "Regulatory Filings"), and listing on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of
the option granted to Devon pursuant to the applicable Stock Option Agreement
under the rules of NYSE, except for any consent, approval or authorization the
failure of which to obtain and for any filing or registration the failure of
which to make would not prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger or otherwise prevent Santa Fe Snyder from performing its obligations
under this Agreement and would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) Other than as contemplated by Section 4.6(b), no consents,
assignments, waivers, authorizations or other certificates are necessary in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to provide for the
continuation in full force and effect of all of Santa Fe Snyder's material
contracts or leases or for Santa Fe Snyder to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, except when the failure to receive such consents or other
certificates would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder
Material Adverse Effect.

         (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will: (i) result in any
payment from Santa Fe Snyder or its Subsidiaries (including severance,
unemployment compensation, parachute payment, bonus or otherwise) becoming due
to any director, employee or independent contractor of Santa Fe Snyder or any of
its Subsidiaries under any Santa Fe Snyder Plan (as defined in Section 4.11) or
otherwise; (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Santa Fe Snyder Plan or otherwise; or (iii) result in the acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

         Section 4.7 SEC DOCUMENTS. Santa Fe Snyder has made available to Devon
each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement
(other than preliminary


                                       10
<PAGE>

materials) filed by Santa Fe Snyder with the SEC since January 1, 1999, each in
the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC
prior to the date hereof (collectively, the "Santa Fe Snyder Reports"), and
Santa Fe Snyder has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed
by it with the SEC pursuant to relevant securities statutes, regulations,
policies and rules since such time. As of their respective dates, the Santa Fe
Snyder Reports (i) were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder and complied in all material respects with the then
applicable accounting requirements and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading except for such
statements, if any, as have been modified by subsequent filings with the SEC
prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Santa Fe Snyder Reports (including the
related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Santa Fe Snyder and its Subsidiaries as of
its date and each of the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, cash flows and stockholders' equity included in or incorporated by
reference into the Santa Fe Snyder Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of operations,
cash flows or changes in stockholders' equity, as the case may be, of Santa Fe
Snyder and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to such exceptions as may be permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC), in each case in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be
noted therein. Since December 31, 1999, neither Santa Fe Snyder nor any of its
Subsidiaries had any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than liabilities or obligations
disclosed in the Santa Fe Snyder Reports or which would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.8 LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending against Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries or, to Santa Fe
Snyder's knowledge, threatened against Santa Fe Snyder or any of its
Subsidiaries, at law or in equity, or before or by any federal, state or foreign
commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, that are likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect.
There are no outstanding judgments, decrees, injunctions, awards or orders
against Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries that are likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.9 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Since December 31, 1999, there
has not been (i) an event that would have a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse
Effect; (ii) any material change by Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries,
when taken as a whole, in any of its accounting methods, principles or practices
or any of its tax methods, practices or elections; (iii) any material damage,
destruction, or loss to the business or properties of Santa Fe Snyder and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, not covered by insurance; (iv) any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution in respect of the
capital stock of Santa Fe Snyder, or any direct or indirect redemption, purchase
or any other acquisition by Santa Fe Snyder of any such stock; (v) except for

Santa Fe Snyder's open market purchase program, any change in the capital stock
or in the number of shares or classes of Santa Fe Snyder's authorized or
outstanding capital stock


                                       11
<PAGE>

(other than as a result of issuances of restricted stock under the Santa Fe
Snyder Plans or exercises of options to purchase Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock
outstanding or issued as permitted hereunder); (vi) any increase in or
establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance, deferred compensation,
pension, retirement, profit sharing, stock option (other than the 2000 Incentive
Stock Option Plan), stock purchase or other employee benefit plan, except in the
ordinary course of business; or (vii) any other event or condition known to
Santa Fe Snyder particularly pertaining to and adversely affecting the
operations, assets or business of Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than events or conditions which are of a general or industry-wide nature
and of general public knowledge) which would constitute, individually or in the
aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.10 TAXES.

filed on its behalf) on a timely basis (taking into account any extensions of
time to file before the date hereof) with appropriate governmental authorities
all tax returns, statements, reports, declarations, estimates and forms
("Returns") required to be filed by or with respect to it, except to the extent
that any failure to file would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a

Effect.

         (b) (i) The federal income tax returns of Santa Fe Snyder and each of
its Subsidiaries have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS")

on any assets of Santa Fe Snyder or its Subsidiaries except for taxes not yet

aggregate, to result in a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect; and (vi)
neither Santa Fe Snyder nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to an agreement
that provides for


                                       12

         (d) Santa Fe Snyder and its Subsidiaries have in full force and effect
all material environmental permits, licenses, approvals and other authorizations
required to conduct their operations and are operating in material compliance
thereunder; and

         (e) Santa Fe Snyder does not know of any reason that would preclude it
from renewing or obtaining a reissuance of the material permits, licenses or
other authorizations required pursuant to any applicable Environmental Laws to
operate and use any of Santa Fe Snyder's or its Subsidiaries' assets for their
current purposes and uses.

         Section 4.14 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Santa Fe Snyder and its
Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all
patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights and proprietary information
used or held for use in connection with their respective businesses as currently
being conducted, free and clear of material Liens, except where the failure to
own or possess such licenses and other rights would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect, and there are no
assertions or claims challenging the validity of any of the foregoing which are
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material
Adverse Effect. Except in the ordinary course of business, neither Santa Fe
Snyder nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted to any other person any license
to use any of the foregoing. The conduct of Santa Fe Snyder's and its
Subsidiaries' respective businesses as currently conducted does not conflict
with any patents, patent rights, licenses, trademarks, trademark rights, trade
names, trade name rights or copyrights of others in any way likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect.
There is no material infringement of any proprietary right owned by or licensed
by or to Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries which is likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.15 TITLE TO PROPERTIES. Except for goods and other property
sold, used or otherwise disposed of since December 31, 1999 in the ordinary
course of business for fair value, Santa Fe Snyder has defensible title for oil
and gas purposes to all its properties, interests in properties and assets, real
and personal, reflected in its December 31, 1999 financial statements, free and
clear of any Lien, except: (a) Liens reflected in the balance sheet of Santa Fe
Snyder as of December 31, 1999; (b) Liens for current taxes not yet due and
payable and (c) such imperfections of title, easements and Liens as would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse
Effect. All leases and other agreements pursuant to which Santa Fe Snyder or any
of its Subsidiaries leases or otherwise acquires or obtains operating rights
affecting any real or personal property are in good standing, valid, and
effective; and there is not, under any such leases, any existing or prospective
default or event of default or event which with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default by Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries
which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Santa Fe Snyder Material
Adverse Effect and in respect to which Santa Fe Snyder or any of its
Subsidiaries has not taken adequate steps to prevent a default from occurring.
All major items of operating equipment of Santa Fe Snyder and its Subsidiaries
are in good operating condition and in a state of reasonable maintenance and
repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Santa Fe Snyder's interest in production of hydrocarbons from each
well, unit or


                                       15
<PAGE>

property described in the report of Ryder Scott Company dated February 7, 2000
and delivered to Devon (after deducting all applicable royalties, overriding
royalties and other payments out of production) is not materially less than the
interest shown under the heading "Net Revenue Interest" for such well, unit or
property, and Santa Fe Snyder's share of exploration, development and operation
costs for each such well, unit or property is not materially greater than the
percentage shown under the heading "Working Interest" for such well, unit or
property. Santa Fe Snyder has not received any material advance, take-or-pay or
other similar payments that entitle purchasers of production to receive
deliveries of hydrocarbons without paying therefor, and, on a net, company-wide
basis, Santa Fe Snyder is neither underproduced nor overproduced under gas
balancing or similar arrangements.

         Section 4.16 INSURANCE. Santa Fe Snyder and its Subsidiaries maintain
insurance coverage reasonably adequate for the operation of their respective
businesses (taking into account the cost and availability of such insurance).

         Section 4.17 NO BROKERS. Santa Fe Snyder has not entered into any
contract, arrangement or understanding with any person or firm which may result
in the obligation of Devon, Merger Co. or Santa Fe Snyder pay any finder's fees,
brokerage or agent's commissions or other like payments in connection with the
negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except that Santa Fe Snyder has retained Chase Securities
Inc. to render the opinion referred to in Section 4.18, the arrangements with
which have been disclosed in writing to Devon prior to the date hereof.

         Section 4.18 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Board of Directors of
Santa Fe Snyder has received the opinion of Chase Securities Inc. to the effect
that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Santa Fe Snyder Exchange Ratio is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Santa Fe Snyder Common
Stock; it being understood and acknowledged by Devon that such opinion has been
rendered for the benefit of the Board of Directors of Santa Fe Snyder, and is
not intended to, and may not, be relied upon by Devon, its affiliates or their
respective Subsidiaries.

         Section 4.19 DEVON STOCK OWNERSHIP. Neither Santa Fe Snyder nor any of
its Subsidiaries owns any shares of capital stock of Devon or any other
securities convertible into or otherwise exercisable to acquire capital stock of
Devon.

         Section 4.20 ACCOUNTING AND REORGANIZATION MATTERS. Santa Fe Snyder
intends that the Merger be accounted for as a Pooling of Interests. To the best
of its knowledge, neither Santa Fe Snyder nor any of its affiliates has taken or
agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying (i) for
Pooling of Interests accounting treatment or (ii) as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (a "368(a) Reorganization").

         Section 4.21 VOTE REQUIRED. The affirmative vote of holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock required by
the DGCL is the only vote necessary to approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 4.22 CERTAIN APPROVALS. Santa Fe Snyder's Board of Directors
has taken any and all necessary and appropriate action to render inapplicable to
the Merger and the transactions


                                       16
<PAGE>

contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock Option Agreements the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL.

         Section 4.23 CERTAIN CONTRACTS. Neither Santa Fe Snyder nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any non-competition agreement or any
other agreement or obligation which purports to limit the manner in which, or
the localities in which, the current business of Santa Fe Snyder and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Devon and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
is conducted or (ii) any executory agreement or obligation which pertains to the
acquisition or disposition of any asset, or which provides any third party any
lien, claim or preferential right with regard thereto, except in each case for
any such agreements or obligations which would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Santa Fe Snyder Material Adverse Effect.

                        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

                  Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to
Santa Fe Snyder concurrently with the execution hereof (the "Devon Disclosure

         Section 5.1 EXISTENCE; GOOD STANDING; CORPORATE AUTHORITY. Each of
Devon and Merger Co. is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each of Devon and Merger
Co. is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its
business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material
Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.9). Each of Devon and Merger Co. has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties
and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of each of Devon's and
Merger Co.'s certificate of incorporation and bylaws previously made available
to Santa Fe Snyder are true and correct and contain all amendments as of the
date hereof.

         Section 5.2 AUTHORIZATION, VALIDITY AND EFFECT OF AGREEMENTS. Each of
Devon and Merger Co. has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreements and all other agreements
and documents contemplated hereby, to which it is a party. The consummation by
each of Devon and Merger Co. of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the issuance and delivery by Devon of shares of Devon Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger, and the consummation by Devon of the transactions contemplated by
the Stock Option Agreements, has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action, other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of
this Agreement by Devon's stockholders. This Agreement and the Stock Option
Agreements constitutes the valid and legally binding obligations of each of
Devon and Merger Co. to the extent it is a party, enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms, subject to applicable


                                       17
<PAGE>

bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors'
rights and general principles of equity.

         Section 5.3 CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of Devon
consists of 400,000,000 shares of Devon Common Stock, one share of Devon Special
Voting Stock, par value $0.10 per share, and 4,500,000 shares of Devon's
preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Devon Preferred Stock"). As of May

Stock of Devon (each, a "Devon Right") issued pursuant to a Rights Agreement,
dated as of August 17, 1999 (the "Devon Rights Agreement"), between Devon and
BankBoston, N.A., is associated with and attached to each outstanding share of
Devon Common Stock. The shares of Devon Common Stock to be issued in connection
with the Merger, when issued in accordance with this Agreement, will be validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of the date of this Agreement, except
as set forth in this Section 5.3 or in the Stock Option Agreements and except
for any shares of Devon Common Stock issued pursuant to the plans described in
the Devon Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding shares of capital stock
and there are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible
securities, or other rights, agreements or commitments which obligate Devon or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock
or other voting securities of Devon or any of its Subsidiaries. Devon has no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which
have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Devon on any
matter.

         Section 5.4 SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES.

         (a) Each of Devon's Significant Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited
liability company or partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (where applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization, has the corporate, limited liability company or partnership
power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing (where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership, operation or lease of its property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except for


                                       18
<PAGE>

jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse
Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership
interests in, each of Devon's Significant Subsidiaries is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and is owned, directly or
indirectly, by Devon free and clear of all Liens. Schedule 5.4 to the Devon
Disclosure Letter sets forth for each Significant Subsidiary of Devon its name
and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.

         (b) Devon Energy Production Company, L.P. ("Devon Production"), a
Significant Subsidiary, is a limited partnership (except for tax purposes) duly
organized and validly existing under Oklahoma law, the general partner of which
is Devon Energy Management Company, L.L.C., an Oklahoma limited liability
company which is wholly owned by Devon Energy Corporation (Oklahoma), an
Oklahoma corporation, and has elected to be treated as a sole proprietorship for
federal income tax purposes. Devon Production has one limited partner. All of
the outstanding partnership interests of Devon Production are owned directly or
indirectly by Devon.

         (c) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Co. are
owned directly by Devon. Merger Co. was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and has not engaged in any
activities other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         Section 5.5 NO VIOLATION. Neither Devon nor any of its Subsidiaries is,
or has received notice that it would be with the passage of time, in violation
of any term, condition or provision of (a) its charter documents or bylaws, (b)
any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, license or other instrument or (c) any order of any court,
governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal, or any law, ordinance,
governmental rule or regulation to which Devon or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets is subject, or is delinquent with
respect to any report required to be filed with any governmental entity, except,
in the case of matters described in clause (b) or (c), as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect. Devon and its
Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders,
franchises and approvals of all governmental authorities necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the "Devon Permits"), except
where the failure so to hold would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Devon Material Adverse Effect. Devon and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with
the terms of the Devon Permits, except where the failure so to comply would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation by any governmental authority with respect to Devon or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Devon, threatened, other than
those the outcome of which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Devon Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.6 NO CONFLICT.

         (a) Neither the execution and delivery by Devon and Merger Co. of this
Agreement, the execution and delivery by Devon of the Stock Option Agreements
nor the consummation by Devon and Merger Co. of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof will: (i)
conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the charter documents
or bylaws of Devon or Merger Co.; (ii) violate, or conflict


                                       19
<PAGE>

with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or cancellation
of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties of
Devon or its Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void, voidable, or
without further binding effect, or otherwise result in a detriment to Devon or
any of its Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit,
lease, contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to
which Devon or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Devon or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or affected; or (iii)
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or decree binding upon or applicable to
Devon or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of matters described in
clause (ii) or (iii), as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Devon Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Neither the execution and delivery by Devon or Merger Co. of this
Agreement, the execution and delivery by Devon of the Stock Option Agreements
nor the consummation by Devon or Merger Co. of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof will require
any consent, approval or authorization of, or filing or registration with, any
governmental or regulatory authority, other than Regulatory Filings, and listing
of the Devon Common Stock to be issued in the Merger on the AMEX and the listing
of the Devon Common Stock upon exercise of the option granted to Santa Fe Snyder
pursuant to the applicable Stock Option Agreement under the rules of the AMEX,
except for any consent, approval or authorization the failure of which to obtain
and for any filing or registration the failure of which to make would not
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent
Devon from performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) Other than as contemplated by Section 5.6(b), no consents,
assignments, waivers, authorizations or other certificates are necessary in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to provide for the
continuation in full force and effect of all of Devon's material contracts or
leases or for Devon to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, except
when the failure to receive such consents or other certificates would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect.

         (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will: (i) result in any
payment from Devon or its Subsidiaries (including severance, unemployment
compensation, parachute payment, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any
director, employee or independent contractor of Devon or any of its Subsidiaries
under any Devon Plan (as defined in Section 5.11) or otherwise; (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Devon Plan or otherwise; or
(iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits.

         Section 5.7 SEC DOCUMENTS. Devon has made available to Santa Fe Snyder
each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement
(other than preliminary materials) filed by Devon with the SEC since January 1,
1999, each in the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed
with the SEC prior to the date hereof (collectively, the "Devon Reports"), and
Devon has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed


                                       20
<PAGE>

by it with the SEC pursuant to relevant securities statutes, regulations,
policies and rules since such time. As of their respective dates, the Devon
Reports (i) were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the rules
and regulations thereunder and complied in all material respects with the then
applicable accounting requirements and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading except for such
statements, if any, as have been modified by subsequent filings with the SEC
prior to the date hereof. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Devon Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of Devon and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity
included in or incorporated by reference into the Devon Reports (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
results of operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders' equity, as the
case may be, of Devon and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to such exceptions as may be
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), in each case in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the periods involved,
except as may be noted therein. Since December 31, 1999, neither Devon nor any
of its Subsidiaries had any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), other than liabilities or
obligations disclosed in the Devon Reports or which would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.8 LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending against Devon or any of its Subsidiaries or, to Devon's knowledge,
threatened against Devon or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity, or
before or by any federal, state or foreign commission, board, bureau, agency or
instrumentality, that are likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Devon Material Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding judgments, decrees,
injunctions, awards or orders against Devon or any of its Subsidiaries that are
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 5.9 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Since December 31, 1999, there
has not been (i) an event that would have a Devon Material Adverse Effect; (ii)
any material change by Devon or any of its Subsidiaries, when taken as a whole,
in any of its accounting methods, principles or practices or any of its tax
methods, practices or elections; (iii) any material damage, destruction, or loss
to the business or properties of Devon and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
not covered by insurance; (iv) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend or other distribution in respect of the capital stock of Devon, or any
direct or indirect redemption, purchase or any other acquisition by Devon of any
such stock (except for, and provided that, Devon may continue to pay or cause to
be paid, dividends upon the shares of Devon Common Stock and the Northstar
Exchangeable Shares at a rate not greater than $.05 per share in any quarter);
(v) any change in the capital stock or in the number of shares or classes of
Devon's authorized or outstanding capital stock (other than as a result of
exercises of options to purchase Devon Common Stock outstanding or issued as
permitted hereunder); (vi) any increase in or establishment of any bonus,
insurance, severance, deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit
sharing, stock option, stock purchase or other employee benefit plan, except in
the ordinary course of business; or (vii) any other event or condition known to
Devon particularly


                                       21
<PAGE>

pertaining to and adversely affecting the operations, assets or business of
Devon or any of its Subsidiaries (other than events or conditions which are of a
general or industry-wide nature and of general public knowledge) which would
constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.10 TAXES.

         (a) Each of Devon, its Subsidiaries and each affiliated, consolidated,
combined, unitary or similar group of which any such corporation is or was a
member has (i) duly filed (or there has been filed on its behalf) on a timely
basis (taking into account any extensions of time to file before the date
hereof) with appropriate governmental authorities all Returns required to be
filed by or with respect to it, except to the extent that any failure to file
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse
Effect, and (ii) duly paid or deposited in full on a timely basis or made
adequate provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(or there has been paid or deposited or adequate provision has been made on its
behalf) for the payment of all taxes required to be paid by it other than those
being contested in good faith by Devon or a Subsidiary of Devon and except to
the extent that any failure to pay or deposit or make adequate provision for the
payment of such taxes would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Devon
Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) (i) The federal income tax returns of Devon and each of its
Subsidiaries have been examined by the IRS (or the applicable statutes of
limitation for the assessment of federal income taxes for such periods have
expired) for all periods; (ii) except to the extent being contested in good
faith, all material deficiencies asserted as a result of such examinations and
any other examinations of Devon and its Subsidiaries by any taxing authority
have been paid fully, settled or adequately provided for in the financial
statements contained in the Devon Reports; (iii) as of the date hereof, neither
Devon nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any requests, agreements, consents
or waivers to extend the statutory period of limitations applicable to the
assessment of any taxes with respect to any Returns of Devon or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries that will be outstanding as of the Effective Time; (iv)
neither Devon nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, is bound by or has any
obligation under any tax sharing, allocation or indemnity agreement or any
similar agreement or arrangement that would have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect; (v) there are no tax liens on any
assets of Devon or its Subsidiaries except for taxes not yet currently due, with
respect to matters being contested by Devon in good faith for which adequate
reserves are reflected in the financial statements and those which could not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Devon
Material Adverse Effect; and (vi) neither Devon nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to an agreement that provides for the payment of any amount that would
constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

         Section 5.11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. For purposes of this Section 5.11,
Devon Subsidiaries shall include any enterprise which, with Devon, forms or
formed a controlled group of corporations, a group of trades or business under
common control or an affiliated service group, within the meaning of Section
414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code. All employee benefit plans, programs,
arrangements and agreements covering active, former or retired employees of
Devon and Devon Subsidiaries which provide material benefits to such employees
are listed in the Devon Disclosure Letter (the "Devon Plans"). Devon has made
available to Santa Fe Snyder

agreement, annuity or insurance contract or other funding vehicle, and: (a) each
Devon Plan has been maintained and administered in material compliance with its
terms and is, to the extent required by applicable law or contract, fully funded
without having any deficit or unfunded actuarial liability or adequate provision
has been made therefor; (b) all required employer contributions under any such
plans have been made and the applicable funds have been funded in accordance
with the terms thereof, (c) each Devon Plan that is required or intended to be

appropriate governmental agency or authority, and nothing has occurred since the
date of the last qualification, registration or approval to adversely affect or
cause the appropriate governmental agency or authority to revoke such
qualification, registration or approval; (d) to the extent applicable, the Devon
Plans comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of ERISA, the Code
and any other applicable tax act and other laws, and any Devon Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the

the loss of such qualified status; (e) no Devon Plan is covered by Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; (f) there are no pending or anticipated

payments required to be made as of the date hereof to the Devon Plans have been

         Section 5.13 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect:

         (a) there are not any present or, to the knowledge of Devon, past
conditions or circumstances that interfere with the conduct of the business of
Devon and each of its Subsidiaries in the manner now conducted or which
interfere with compliance with any order of any court, governmental authority or
arbitration board or tribunal, or any Environmental Law;

         (b) there are not any present or, to the knowledge of Devon, past
conditions or circumstances at, or arising out of, any current or, to the
knowledge of Devon, former businesses, assets or properties of Devon or any
Subsidiary of Devon, including but not limited to, on-site or off-site disposal
or release of any chemical substance, product or waste, which constitute a
violation under any Environmental Law or could reasonably be expected to give
rise to: (i) liabilities or obligations for any cleanup, remediation, disposal
or corrective action under any Environmental Law or (ii) claims arising for
personal injury, property damage, or damage to natural resources;

         (c) neither Devon nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) received any
written notice of noncompliance with, violation of, or liability or potential
liability under any Environmental Law, (ii) received any written notice
regarding any existing, pending or threatened investigation or inquiry related
to alleged violations under any Environmental Laws or regarding any claims for
remedial obligations or contribution under any Environmental Laws or (iii)
entered into any consent decree or order or is subject to any order of any court
or governmental authority or tribunal under any Environmental Law or relating to
the cleanup of any hazardous materials contamination;

         (d) Devon and its Subsidiaries have in full force and effect all
material environmental permits, licenses, approvals and other authorizations
required to conduct their operations and are operating in material compliance
thereunder; and

         (e) Devon does not know of any reason that would preclude it from
renewing or obtaining a reissuance of the material permits, licenses or other
authorizations required pursuant to any applicable Environmental Laws to operate
and use any of Devon's or its Subsidiaries' assets for their current purposes
and uses.

         Section 5.14 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Devon and its Subsidiaries own or
possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to use all patents, patent
rights, trademarks, trademark rights and proprietary information used or held
for use in connection with their respective businesses as currently being
conducted, free and clear of material Liens, except where the failure to own or
possess such licenses and other rights would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect, and there are no assertions or
claims challenging the validity of any of the foregoing which are likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect. Except
in the ordinary course of business, neither Devon nor any of its Subsidiaries
has granted to any other person any license to use any of the foregoing. The
conduct of Devon's and its Subsidiaries' respective businesses as currently
conducted does not conflict with any patents, patent rights, licenses,
trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights or copyrights of
others in any way likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a


                                       24
<PAGE>

Devon Material Adverse Effect. There is no material infringement of any
proprietary right owned by or licensed by or to Devon or any of its Subsidiaries
which is likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material
Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.15 TITLE TO PROPERTIES. Except for goods and other property
sold, used or otherwise disposed of since December 31, 1999 in the ordinary
course of business for fair value, Devon has defensible title for oil and gas
purposes to all its properties, interests in properties and assets, real and
personal, reflected in its December 31, 1999 financial statements, free and
clear of any Lien, except: (a) Liens reflected in the balance sheet of Devon as
of December 31, 1999; (b) Liens for current taxes not yet due and payable and
(c) such imperfections of title, easements and Liens as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect. All leases
and other agreements pursuant to which Devon or any of its Subsidiaries leases
or otherwise acquires or obtains operating rights affecting any real or personal
property are in good standing, valid, and effective; and there is not, under any
such leases, any existing or prospective default or event of default or event
which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by
Devon or any of its Subsidiaries which, individually or in the aggregate, would
have a Devon Material Adverse Effect and in respect to which Devon or any of its
Subsidiaries has not taken adequate steps to prevent a default from occurring.
All major items of operating equipment of Devon and its Subsidiaries are in good
operating condition and in a state of reasonable maintenance and repair,
ordinary wear and tear excepted. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Devon's interest in production of hydrocarbons from each well, unit
or property described in the reports of (i) LaRoche Petroleum Consultants, Ltd.
dated January 25, 2000, (ii) Paddock Lindstrom & Associates, Ltd. dated January
19, 2000, (iii) Ryder Scott Company dated February 18, 2000 and (iv) Devon dated
January 4, 2000 and delivered to Santa Fe Snyder (after deducting all applicable
royalties, overriding royalties and other payments out of production) is not
materially less than the interest shown under the heading "Net Revenue Interest"
for such well, unit or property, and Devon's share of exploration, development
and operation costs for each such well, unit or property is not materially
greater than the percentage shown under the heading "Working Interest" for such
well, unit or property. Devon has not received any material advance, take-or-pay
or other similar payments that entitle purchasers of production to receive
deliveries of hydrocarbons without paying therefor, and, on a net, company-wide
basis, Devon is neither underproduced nor overproduced under gas balancing or
similar arrangements.

         Section 5.16 INSURANCE. Devon and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance
coverage reasonably adequate for the operation of their respective businesses
(taking into account the cost and availability of such insurance).

         Section 5.17 NO BROKERS. Devon has not entered into any contract,
arrangement or understanding with any person or firm which may result in the
obligation of Devon, Merger Co. or Santa Fe Snyder to pay any finder's fees,
brokerage or agent's commissions or other like payments in connection with the
negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except that Devon has retained Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
to prepare the opinion as set forth in Section 5.18, the arrangements with which
have been disclosed in writing to Santa Fe Snyder prior to the date hereof.

         Section 5.18 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Board of Directors of
Devon has received the opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated to the
effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Santa Fe Snyder Exchange
Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to Devon; it being understood and
acknowledged by Santa Fe Snyder that such opinion has been rendered for the
benefit of the Board of Directors of Devon, and is not intended to, and may not,
be relied upon by Santa Fe Snyder, its affiliates or their respective
Subsidiaries.

         Section 5.19 SANTA FE SNYDER STOCK OWNERSHIP. Neither Devon nor any of

stock of Santa Fe Snyder.

         Section 5.20 ACCOUNTING AND REORGANIZATION MATTERS. Each of Devon and
Merger Co. intends that the Merger be accounted for as a Pooling of Interests.
To the best of its knowledge, neither Devon nor any of its affiliates has taken
or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from qualifying (i)
for Pooling of Interests accounting treatment or (ii) as a 368(a)
Reorganization.

         Section 5.21 VOTE REQUIRED. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Devon Common Stock and the outstanding
Northstar Exchangeable Shares, voting as a single class with the Devon Special
Voting Share voting for the Northstar Exchangeable Shares as provided in Devon's
charter, represented in person or by proxy at a meeting at which quorum is
present is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Devon capital
stock necessary to approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if a proposal to amend Devon's Certificate of
Incorporation is presented at the meeting for approval pursuant to Section 2.1
hereof, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Devon Common Stock and the outstanding Northstar Exchangeable Shares,
voting as a single class with the Devon Special Voting Share voting for the
Northstar Exchangeable Shares as provided in Devon's charter, will be required
for approval.

         Section 5.22 DEVON RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Devon has taken all required
action under the Devon Rights Agreement so that none of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Stock Option Agreements, the issuance of
shares of Devon Common Stock upon exercise of the option granted to Santa Fe
Snyder pursuant to the applicable Stock Option Agreement, and the consummation
of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or by the Stock
Option Agreement, will cause (i) the Devon Rights to become exercisable under
the Devon Rights Agreement, (ii) Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries to
be deemed an "Acquiring Person" (as defined in the Devon Rights Agreement),
(iii) any such event to be an event described in Section 7(e) or 13 of the Devon
Rights Agreement or (iv) the "Stock Acquisition Date" or the "Distribution Date"
(each as defined in the Devon Rights Agreement) to occur upon any such event.
Devon has delivered to Santa Fe Snyder a true and complete copy of the Devon
Rights Agreement, as amended to date.

         Section 5.23 CERTAIN APPROVALS. Devon's Board of Directors has taken
any and all necessary and appropriate action to render inapplicable to the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock Option
Agreements the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL.

         Section 5.24 CERTAIN CONTRACTS. Neither Devon nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any non-competition agreement or any
other agreement or obligation which purports to limit the manner in which, or
the localities in which, the current business of Devon and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or Santa Fe Snyder and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is
conducted or (ii) any executory agreement or obligation which pertains to the
acquisition or disposition of any asset, or which provides any third party any
lien, claim or preferential right with regard thereto, except in each case for
any such agreements or obligations which would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Devon Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 6.2 NO SOLICITATION BY SANTA FE SNYDER.

         (a) Santa Fe Snyder agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not
knowingly (and it will not permit their officers, directors, employees, agents

into account the likelihood of consummation, after consultation with its
financial advisors, is superior to the Merger (a "Santa Fe Snyder Superior

with its outside legal counsel, determines that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

         (b) Santa Fe Snyder will promptly notify Devon of any requests referred
to in Section 6.2(a) for information or the receipt of any Santa Fe Snyder

         (a) Each of Devon and Santa Fe Snyder will take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws
to convene a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable to consider
and vote upon the approval of this Agreement and the Merger, and in the case of
Devon, if necessary pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof, an amendment to Devon's

cooperate with respect to the timing of such meetings and shall use their
reasonable commercial efforts to hold such meetings on the same day.

         (b) Santa Fe Snyder and Devon, through their respective Boards of
Directors, shall recommend approval of such matters; provided that the Board of
Directors of Santa Fe Snyder or the Board of Directors of Devon may at any time
prior to the Effective Time withdraw, modify, or change any recommendation and

the opinion of such Board of Directors after consultation with its counsel the
failure to so withdraw, modify, or change its recommendation and declaration
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations.

prepare and Devon shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act (the "Registration Statement"),
with respect to the Devon Common Stock issuable in the Merger. A portion of the
Registration Statement shall also serve as the joint proxy statement with

connection with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). The respective
parties will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement
to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Devon shall use its reasonable commercial efforts, and Santa Fe Snyder will
cooperate with Devon, to have the Registration Statement declared effective by
the SEC as promptly as practicable. Devon shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement,
all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or approvals required

commercial efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its

of the respective meetings of stockholders of Devon and of Santa Fe Snyder, or,
in the case of information provided by it for inclusion in the Registration
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it is filed or
becomes effective, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

         Section 6.9 LISTING APPLICATION. Devon shall use its reasonable
commercial efforts to cause the Devon Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to
be approved for listing on the AMEX prior to the Effective Time, subject to
official notice of issuance. Devon shall promptly prepare and submit to the AMEX

reasonable commercial efforts to cause to be delivered to Devon "comfort"

accountants, dated the effective date of the Registration Statement and the
Closing Date, respectively, and addressed to Devon with regard to certain
financial information regarding Santa Fe Snyder included in the Registration
Statement, in form reasonably satisfactory to Devon and customary in scope and
substance for "comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants in

reasonable commercial efforts to cause to be delivered to Santa Fe Snyder

effective date of the Registration Statement and the Closing Date, respectively,
and addressed to Santa Fe Snyder, with regard to certain financial information
regarding Devon included in the Registration Statement, in form reasonably
satisfactory to Santa Fe Snyder and customary in scope and substance for
"comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.

         (c) Santa Fe Snyder shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to
cause to be delivered to it, immediately prior to the Effective Time, from

opinion in form and substance acceptable to Santa Fe Snyder that the Merger
should be accounted for as a Pooling of Interests (the "PricewaterhouseCoopers
Opinion").

         (d) Devon shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause to be
delivered to it, immediately prior to the Effective Time, from KPMG LLP, Devon's
independent public


                                       35
<PAGE>

accountants, an opinion in form and substance acceptable to Devon that the
Merger should be accounted for as a Pooling of Interests (the "KPMG Opinion").

         Section 6.11 AGREEMENTS OF AFFILIATES.

         (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Santa Fe Snyder shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Devon a list identifying all persons who, at the time
of the meeting or the meeting of Santa Fe Snyder's stockholders pursuant to
Section 6.4, Santa Fe Snyder believes may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Santa
Fe Snyder, as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates"). Devon shall be entitled to place
restrictive legends on any shares of Devon Common Stock received by such Rule
145 Affiliates. Santa Fe Snyder shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to
cause each person who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to
deliver to Devon, at or prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, in the
form to be approved by the parties hereto, that such Rule 145 Affiliate will not
sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of Devon Common Stock
issued to such Rule 145 Affiliate pursuant to the Merger, except pursuant to an
effective registration statement or in compliance with Rule 145 or an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

         (b) At or prior to a date 45 days prior to the Effective Time, Santa Fe
Snyder and Devon shall each cause to be prepared and delivered to the other a
list identifying all persons Santa Fe Snyder and Devon believe may be deemed to
be their "affiliates" as that term is used in Section E of Topic 2 of the staff
accounting bulletin series (the "Pooling Affiliates"). Santa Fe Snyder and Devon
shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause each person who is
identified as their Pooling Affiliates to deliver to the other party, at or
prior to the Effective Time, a written agreement, in the form to be approved by
the parties hereto, that such Pooling Affiliates will not intentionally take any
action that would cause the Merger to fail to be accounted for as a Pooling of
Interests.

         Section 6.12 EXPENSES. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, except as expressly provided in Section 8.5.

         Section 6.13 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, Devon shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law each
person who is, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer
or director of Santa Fe Snyder (or any Subsidiary or division thereof) and each
person who served at the request of Santa Fe Snyder as a director, officer,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (individually, an
"Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or
pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their
capacities as such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the
Effective Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (an "Action"), (i) Devon shall pay, as incurred,


                                       36
<PAGE>

the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Devon, in advance of the final
disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, and, if required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable
law, and (ii) Devon will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, Devon shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
and provided FURTHER, that Devon shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section
6.13(a) to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in any single Action, unless, in the good faith judgment of
any of the Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interests
between two or more of such Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be
separate counsel for each similarly situated group.

         (b) The parties agree that the rights to indemnification, including
provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any action or
suit, in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and any indemnification
agreement of Santa Fe Snyder and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
occurring through the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective
Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Action pending or asserted or claim made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

         (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Devon shall
cause to be maintained officers' and directors' liability insurance covering the
Indemnified Parties who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time were
covered by Santa Fe Snyder's existing officers' and directors' liability
insurance policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance with respect to acts or
omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether
claims, actions or other proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or
claimed before or after the Effective Time); PROVIDED, that after the Effective
Time, Devon shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of
the last annual premium paid by Devon prior to the date hereof (the amount of
which premiums are set forth in the Devon Disclosure Letter), but in such case
shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

         (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition
to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries, under the
DGCL, or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.13 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the
Indemnified Parties.

         (e) In the event Devon or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Devon, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.13.

agreements of Devon and Santa Fe Snyder with respect to employee benefit
matters.

the Effective Time, none of Devon, Santa Fe Snyder or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall knowingly (i) take any action, or fail to take any reasonable
action, as a result of which the Merger would fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) enter
into any contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement to take or fail to take
any such action. Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the opinions of counsel referred to in Sections 7.2(b) and 7.3(b).

                  Following the Effective Time, Devon shall not knowingly take
any action or knowingly cause any action to be taken which would cause the
Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section
368(a) of the Code (and any comparable provisions of applicable state or local
law).

         Section 6.16 RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Board of Directors of Devon shall take any action (including, if necessary,
amending or terminating (but with respect to termination, only as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) the Devon Rights Agreement)
necessary so that none of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Stock Option Agreements, the issuance of Devon Common Stock upon exercise of
the option granted to Santa Fe Snyder pursuant to the applicable Stock Option
Agreement, the consummation of the Merger, or any other transaction
contemplated hereby or by the Stock Option Agreements will cause (i) the
Devon Rights to become exercisable under the Devon Rights Agreement, (ii)
Santa Fe Snyder or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed an "Acquiring Person"
(as defined in the Devon Rights Agreement), (iii) any such event to be an
event described in Section 13 of the Devon Rights Agreement or (iv) the
"Stock Acquisition Date" or the "Distribution Date" (each as defined in the
Devon Rights Agreement) to occur upon any such event. Neither the Board of
Directors of Devon nor Devon shall take any other action to terminate the
Devon Rights Agreement, redeem the Devon Rights, cause any person not to be
or become an "Acquiring Person" or otherwise amend the Devon Rights Agreement
in a manner adverse to Santa Fe Snyder, unless otherwise ordered by a court
of competent jurisdiction.

injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction, U.S. or foreign, which

         (a) If this Agreement is terminated

                  (i) by Santa Fe Snyder pursuant to Section 8.3(a); or

                  (ii) after the public announcement of a Santa Fe Snyder
          Acquisition Proposal, by Santa Fe Snyder or Devon pursuant to Section
          8.2(b); or

                  (iii) after the public announcement, or receipt by Santa Fe
          Snyder's Board of Directors of a Santa Fe Snyder Acquisition Proposal,
          by Devon pursuant to Section 8.4(c);

then Santa Fe Snyder shall pay Devon the Santa Fe Snyder Termination Amount
(subject to reduction pursuant to Section 6 of the applicable Stock Option
Agreement) at the time of such termination in cash by wire transfer to an
account designated by Devon. The term "Santa Fe Snyder Termination Amount" shall
mean, in the case of termination pursuant to clause (i) or clause (iii) of the
preceding sentence, $103,000,000 or, in the case of termination pursuant to
clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, "Santa Fe Snyder Termination Amount"
shall mean $46,350,000 plus, if (x) Santa Fe Snyder executes and delivers an
agreement with respect to any Santa Fe Snyder Acquisition or (y) a Santa Fe
Snyder Acquisition is consummated, in any such case, within 12 months from the
date of termination pursuant to clause (ii), an additional $56,650,000 (which
additional amount shall be paid promptly by wire transfer to an account
designated by Devon). If the Board of Directors of Santa Fe Snyder recommends
the acceptance by the stockholders of Santa Fe Snyder of a third-party tender or
exchange offer for Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock, such recommendation shall be
treated for purposes of this paragraph as though an agreement with respect to a
Santa Fe Snyder Acquisition had been executed and delivered. For purposes
hereof, "Santa Fe Snyder Acquisition" means (i) a consolidation, exchange of
shares or merger of Santa Fe Snyder with any person, other than Devon or one of
its Subsidiaries or any of Santa Fe Snyder's Subsidiaries, and, in the case of a
merger, in which Santa Fe Snyder shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation, (ii) a merger of Santa Fe Snyder with a person, other than Devon or
one of its Subsidiaries or any of Santa Fe Snyder's Subsidiaries, in which Santa
Fe Snyder shall be the continuing or surviving corporation but the then
outstanding shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock shall be changed into or
exchanged for stock or other securities of Santa Fe Snyder or any other person
or cash or any other property or the shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock
outstanding immediately before such merger shall after such merger represent
less than 50% of the voting stock of Santa Fe Snyder outstanding immediately
after the merger, (iii) the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 50% or more
of the voting stock of Santa Fe Snyder by any person (as such term is used under
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), or (iv) a sale, lease or other transfer of
50% or more of the assets of Santa Fe Snyder to any person, other than Devon or
one of its Subsidiaries or any of Santa Fe Snyder's Subsidiaries. Santa Fe
Snyder acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5(a) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Devon would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Santa Fe Snyder fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.5(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, Devon commences a
suit which results in a judgment against Santa Fe Snyder for the payment set
forth in this Section


                                       43
<PAGE>

8.5(a), Santa Fe Snyder shall pay to Devon its costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
Santa Fe Snyder Termination Amount from each date for payment until the date of
such payment at the prime rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made plus two percent (2%).

         (b) If this Agreement is terminated

                  (i) by Devon pursuant to Section 8.4(a); or

                  (ii) after the public announcement of a Devon Acquisition
          Proposal, by Santa Fe Snyder or Devon pursuant to Section 8.2(c); or

                  (iii) after the public announcement or receipt by Devon's
          Board of Directors of a Devon Acquisition Proposal, by Santa Fe Snyder
          pursuant to Section 8.3(c);

then Devon shall pay Santa Fe Snyder the Devon Termination Amount (subject to
reduction pursuant to Section 6 of the applicable Stock Option Agreement) at the
time of such termination in cash by wire transfer to an account designated by
Santa Fe Snyder. The term "Devon Termination Amount" shall mean, in the case of
termination pursuant to clause (i) or clause (iii) of the preceding sentence,
$103,000,000 or, in the case of termination pursuant to clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence, "Devon Termination Amount" shall mean $46,350,000 plus, if
(x) Devon executes and delivers an agreement with respect to any Devon
Acquisition or (y) a Devon Acquisition is consummated, in any such case, within
12 months from the date of termination pursuant to clause (ii), an additional
$56,650,000 (which additional amount shall be paid promptly by wire transfer to
an account designated by Santa Fe Snyder). If the Board of Directors of Devon
recommends the acceptance by the stockholders of Devon of a third party tender
or exchange offer for the Devon Common Stock, such recommendation shall be
treated for purposes of this paragraph as though an agreement with respect to a
Devon Acquisition had been executed and delivered. For purposes hereof, "Devon
Acquisition" means (i) a consolidation, exchange of shares or merger of Devon
with any person, other than Santa Fe Snyder or one of its Subsidiaries or any of
Devon's Subsidiaries, and, in the case of a merger, in which Devon shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation, (ii) a merger of Devon with a person,
other than Santa Fe Snyder or one of its Subsidiaries or any of Devon's
Subsidiaries, in which Devon shall be the continuing or surviving corporation
but the then outstanding shares of Devon Common Stock shall be changed into or
exchanged for stock or other securities of Devon or any other person or cash or
any other property or the shares of Devon Common Stock outstanding immediately
before such merger shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the voting
stock of Devon outstanding immediately after the merger, (iii) the acquisition
of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the voting stock of Devon by any
person (as such term is used. under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), or (iv)
a sale, lease or other transfer of 50% or more of the assets of Devon to any
person, other than Santa Fe Snyder or one of its Subsidiaries or any of Devon's
Subsidiaries. Devon acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.5(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that,


                                       44
<PAGE>

without these agreements, Santa Fe Snyder would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Devon fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Santa Fe Snyder commences
a suit which results in a judgment against Devon for the payment set forth in
this Section 8.5(b), Devon shall pay to Santa Fe Snyder its costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest
on the Devon Termination Amount from each date for payment until the date of
such payment at the prime rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made plus two percent (2%).

         (c) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment
of the Merger pursuant to this Article 8, all obligations of the parties hereto
shall terminate, except the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Section
8.5 and Section 6.12 and except for the provisions of Sections 9.3, 9.4, 9.6,
9.8, 9.9, 9.12, 9.13 and 9.14, PROVIDED that nothing herein shall relieve any
party from any liability for any willful and material breach by such party of
any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement and all rights
and remedies of such nonbreaching party under this Agreement in the case of such
a willful and material breach, at law or in equity, shall be preserved.

         Section 8.6 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each party may by action taken by its Board of Directors, to the extent legally
allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party.

     The Board of Directors of the Company has approved and adopted the
Merger Agreement, the Merger and this Agreement and has recommended approval
of the Merger Agreement by the holders of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock (as
defined in the Merger Agreement).

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and in
the Merger Agreement, the Company and the Grantee agree as follows:

1.   CAPITALIZED TERMS.  Those capitalized terms used but not defined herein
that are defined in the Merger Agreement are used herein with the same
meanings as ascribed to them therein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, as used in
this Agreement, "Person" shall have the meaning specified in Sections 3(a)(9)
and 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.  Those capitalized terms used in this
Agreement that are not defined in the Merger Agreement are defined in Annex A
hereto and are used herein with the meanings ascribed to them therein.

2.   THE OPTION.

     (a)  GRANT OF OPTION.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Company hereby grants to the Grantee an irrevocable option to
purchase, out of the authorized but unissued Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock,
36,424,413 shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock (as adjusted as set forth
herein) (the "Option Shares"), at the Exercise Price.

     (b)  EXERCISE PRICE. The exercise price (the "Exercise Price") per
Option Share shall be the Current Market Price per share of Santa Fe Snyder
Common Stock on the date of this Agreement.

<PAGE>

     (c)  TERM. The Option shall either (i) be exercisable at any time and
from time to time following the occurrence of an Exercise Event described in
subsection (i) of the definition of an Exercise Event and remain in full
force and effect for one year thereafter, or (ii) be exercisable at any time
and from time to time following the occurrence of an Exercise Event described
in subsection (ii) of the definition of an Exercise Event and remain in full
force and effect for one year thereafter (the "Option Term").  This Option
shall terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the failure of Grantee to
exercise the Option prior to the termination of the Option Term, (ii) the
Effective Time, (iii) Grantee's written notice of termination of this
Agreement to the Company, and (iv) termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms under circumstances in which the Option does not
and could not, through the passage of time or in conjunction with subsequent
events, become exercisable in accordance with the preceding sentence.

     (d)  EXERCISE OF OPTION.

          (i)   The Grantee may exercise the Option, in whole or in part, at
any time and from time to time during the Option Term. Notwithstanding the
expiration of the Option Term, the Grantee shall be entitled to purchase
those Option Shares with respect to which it has exercised the Option in
accordance with the terms hereof prior to the expiration of the Option Term.

          (ii)  If the Grantee wishes to exercise the Option, it shall send a
written notice (an "Exercise Notice") (the date of which being herein
referred to as the "Notice Date") to the Company specifying (i) the total
number of Option Shares it intends to purchase pursuant to such exercise and
(ii) a place and a date (the "Closing Date") not earlier than three Business
Days nor later than 15 Business Days from the Notice Date for the closing of
the purchase and sale pursuant to the Option (the "Closing").

          (iii) If the Closing cannot be effected by reason of the
application of any Law, Regulation or Order, the Closing Date shall be
extended to the tenth Business Day following the expiration or termination of
the restriction imposed by such Law, Regulation or Order; PROVIDED HOWEVER,
that during this extended period, notwithstanding any prior Exercise Notice,
Grantee shall be entitled to rescind such Exercise Notice and shall not be
obligated to purchase any Option Shares in connection with such exercise upon
written notice to such effect to the Company.  Without limiting the
foregoing, if prior notification to, or Authorization of, any Governmental
Authority is required in connection with the purchase of such Option Shares
by virtue of the application of such Law, Regulation or Order, the Grantee
and, if applicable, the Company shall promptly file the required notice or
application for Authorization and the Grantee, with the cooperation of the
Company, shall expeditiously process the same.

     (e)  PAYMENT AND DELIVERY OF CERTIFICATES.

          (i)   At each Closing, the Grantee shall pay to the Company in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by
the Company an amount equal to the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of
Option Shares to be purchased on such Closing Date.  Alternatively, the
Grantee may elect to purchase Option Shares issuable, and pay some or all of
the aggregate Exercise Price payable, upon an exercise of the Option by
surrendering a portion of the Option with respect to such number of Option
Shares as is determined by dividing

                                       2
<PAGE>

(i) the aggregate Exercise Price payable in respect of the number of Option
Shares being purchased in such manner by (ii) the excess of the Current
Market Price per share of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock as of the last trading
day preceding the date Grantee delivers its Exercise Notice over the per
share Exercise Price.

          (ii)  At each Closing, simultaneously with the delivery of
immediately available funds as provided above, the Company shall deliver to
the Grantee a certificate or certificates representing the Option Shares to
be purchased at such Closing, which Option Shares shall be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of all Liens,
and the Grantee shall deliver to the Company its written agreement that the
Grantee will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such Option Shares in
violation of applicable Law or the provisions of this Agreement.

     (f)  CERTIFICATES. Certificates for the Option Shares delivered at each
Closing shall be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read
substantially as follows:

          THE TRANSFER OF THE STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE IS
     SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ARISING UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
     AMENDED.

     A new certificate or certificates evidencing the same number of shares
of the Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock will be issued to the Grantee in lieu of
the certificate bearing the above legend, and such new certificate shall not
bear such legend if the Grantee shall have delivered to the Company a copy of
a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and its counsel, to the
effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act.

     (g)  If at the time of issuance of any Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock
pursuant to any exercise of the Option, the Company shall have issued any
share purchase rights or similar securities to holders of Santa Fe Snyder
Common Stock, then each Option Share purchased pursuant to the Option shall
also include rights with terms substantially the same as and at least as
favorable to the Grantee as those issued to other holders of Santa Fe Snyder
Common Stock.

3.   ADJUSTMENT UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION, ETC.

     (a)  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Santa Fe
Snyder Common Stock by reason of a stock dividend, stock split, split-up,
merger, consolidation, recapitalization, combination, conversion, exchange of
shares, extraordinary or liquidating dividend or similar transaction which
would have the effect of diluting the Grantee's rights hereunder, the type
and number of shares or securities purchasable upon the exercise of the
Option and the Exercise Price shall be adjusted appropriately, and proper
provision will be made in the agreements governing such transaction, so that
the Grantee will receive upon exercise of the Option the number and class of
shares or other securities or property that Grantee would have received in
respect of the Option Shares had the Option been exercised immediately prior
to such event or the record date therefor, as applicable. In no event shall
the number of shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock subject to the Option
exceed 19.9% of the number of shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock issued
and outstanding at the time of exercise.

                                       3
<PAGE>

     (b)  Without limiting the foregoing, whenever the number of Option
Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Option is adjusted as provided in
this Section 3, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the
Exercise Price by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number
of Option Shares purchasable prior to the adjustment and the denominator of
which is equal to the number of Option Shares purchasable after the
adjustment.

     (c)  Without limiting the parties' relative rights and obligations under
the Merger Agreement, if the Company enters into an agreement to consummate a
Business Combination Transaction, then, and in each such case, the agreement
governing such transaction will make proper provision so that the Option
will, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option
with identical terms appropriately adjusted to acquire the number and class
of shares or other securities or property that Grantee would have received in
respect of Option Shares had the Option been exercised immediately prior to
such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer or the record date therefor, as
applicable, and will make any other necessary adjustments and the Company
shall take such steps in connection with such consolidation, merger,
liquidation or other such transaction as may be reasonably necessary to
assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter apply as nearly as
possible to any securities or property thereafter deliverable upon exercise
of the Option.

4.   REPURCHASE AT THE OPTION OF GRANTEE.

     (a)  At the request of the Grantee made at any time and from time to
time after the occurrence of an Exercise Event and prior to 120 days after
the expiration of the Option Term (the "Put Period"), the Company (or any
successor thereto) shall, at the election of the Grantee (the "Put Right"),
repurchase from the Grantee (i) that portion of the Option relating to all or
any part of the Unexercised Option Shares (or as to which the Option has been
exercised but the Closing has not occurred) and (ii) all or any portion of
the Option Shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock purchased by the Grantee
upon exercise of the Option (or any portion thereof) and with respect to
which the Grantee then has ownership. The date on which the Grantee exercises
its rights under this Section 4 is referred to as the "Put Date." Such
repurchase shall be at an aggregate price (the "Put Consideration") equal to
the sum of:

          (i)   the aggregate Exercise Price paid by the Grantee for any
Option Shares which the Grantee owns and as to which the Grantee is
exercising the Put Right;

          (ii)  the excess, if any, of (x) the Applicable Price per share of
Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock over (y) the Exercise Price paid by the Grantee
for each Option Share as to which the Grantee is exercising the Put Right,
multiplied by the number of such Option Shares; and

          (iii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Applicable Price per share of
Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock over (y) the Exercise Price, multiplied by the
number of Unexercised Option Shares as to which the Grantee is exercising the
Put Right.

     (b)  If the Grantee exercises its rights under this Section 4, the
Company shall, within five Business Days after the Put Date, pay the Put
Consideration to the Grantee in immediately

                                       4
<PAGE>

available funds, and the Grantee shall surrender to the Company the Option or
portion of the Option and the certificates evidencing the Option Shares of
Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock purchased thereunder. The Grantee shall warrant
to the Company that, immediately prior to the repurchase thereof pursuant to
this Section 4, the Grantee had sole record and Beneficial Ownership of the
Option or such Option Shares, or both, as the case may be, and that the
Option or such shares, or both, as the case may be, were then held free and
clear of all Liens.

     (c)  If the Option has been exercised, in whole or in part, as to any
Option Shares subject to the Put Right but the Closing thereunder has not
occurred, the payment of the Put Consideration shall, to that extent, render
such exercise null and void.

     (d)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Grantee may not exercise its rights pursuant to this Section 4 in a
manner that would result in Total Profit of more than the Profit Cap;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this sentence shall limit the Grantee's
ability to exercise the Option in accordance with its terms.

     (e)  To the extent that the Company is prohibited under applicable Law
from repurchasing the portion of the Option or the Option Shares pursuant to
this Section 4, the Company shall immediately so notify Grantee and
thereafter deliver, from time to time, to Grantee the portion of the Put
Consideration that it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five
Business Days after the date on which the Company is no longer so prohibited;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Company at any time after the Put Date is
prohibited under applicable Law from delivering to Grantee the full amount of
the Put Consideration, Grantee may rescind the exercise of the Put Right,
whether in whole, in part or to the extent of the prohibition, and, to the
extent rescinded, no part of the amounts, terms or the rights with respect to
the Option or Put Right shall be changed or affected as if such Put Right was
not exercised.  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices
to permit Grantee to exercise its Put Right and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to avoid or cause to be rescinded or rendered inapplicable any
prohibition on the Company's repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares.

5.   REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

     (a)  The Company shall, if requested by the Grantee at any time and from
time to time during the Registration Period, as expeditiously as practicable,
prepare, file and cause to be made effective up to two registration
statements under the Securities Act if such registration is required in order
to permit the offering, sale and delivery of any or all shares of Santa Fe
Snyder Common Stock or other securities that have been acquired by or are
issuable to the Grantee upon exercise of the Option in accordance with the
intended method of sale or other disposition stated by the Grantee,
including, at the sole discretion of the Company, a "shelf" registration
statement under Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any successor provision,
and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to qualify such shares or
other securities under any applicable state securities laws. The Company
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause each such registration statement to
become effective, to obtain all consents or waivers of other parties that are
required therefor and to keep such registration statement effective for such
period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement
first becomes effective as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sale or
other disposition. The obligations of the Company hereunder to file a
registration

                                       5
<PAGE>

statement and to maintain its effectiveness may be suspended for one or more
periods of time not exceeding 60 days in the aggregate if the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith that the filing
of such registration or the maintenance of its effectiveness would require
disclosure of nonpublic information that would materially and adversely
affect the Company. For purposes of determining whether two requests have
been made under this Section 5, only requests relating to a registration
statement that has become effective under the Securities Act and pursuant to
which the Grantee has disposed of all shares covered thereby in the manner
contemplated therein shallbe counted.

     (b)  The Registration Expenses shall be for the account of the Company;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be required to pay any
Registration Expenses with respect to such registration if the registration
request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Grantee unless the
Grantee agrees to forfeit its right to request one registration.

     (c)  The Grantee shall provide all information reasonably requested by
the Company for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed
hereunder. If during the Registration Period the Company shall propose to
register under the Securities Act the offering, sale and delivery of Santa Fe
Snyder Common Stock for cash for its own account or for any other stockholder
of the Company pursuant to a firm underwriting, it shall, in addition to the
Company's other obligations under this Section 5, allow the Grantee the right
to participate in such registration provided that the Grantee participates in
the underwriting; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the managing underwriter of
such offering advises the Company in writing that in its opinion the number
of shares of Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock requested to be included in such
registration exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering, the
Company shall, after fully including therein all securities to be sold by the
Company or, if such registration relates to Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock of
any other stockholder of the Company being registered pursuant to a demand
registration, all securities to be sold by such other stockholder, include
the shares requested to be included therein by Grantee pro rata (based on the
number of shares intended to be included therein) with the shares intended to
be included therein by Persons other than the Company or, in the case of a
demand registration of a Company stockholder, with the shares intended to be
included therein by the Company or other Company stockholders.

     (d)  In connection with any offering, sale and delivery of Santa Fe
Snyder Common Stock pursuant to a registration statement effected pursuant to
this Section 5, the Company and the Grantee shall provide each other and each
underwriter of the offering with customary representations, warranties and
covenants, including covenants of indemnification and contribution.

6.   PROFIT LIMITATION.

     (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event
shall the Grantee's Total Profit exceed the Profit Cap and, if it otherwise
would exceed such amount, the Grantee, at its sole election, shall either (i)
deliver to the Company for cancellation Option Shares previously purchased by
Grantee, (ii) pay cash or other consideration to the Company, (iii) reduce
the amount of the fee payable to Grantee under Section 8.5 of the Merger
Agreement or (iv) undertake any combination thereof, so that the Grantee's
Total Profit shall not exceed the Profit Cap after taking into account the
foregoing actions.

                                       6
<PAGE>

     (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Stock
Option may not be exercised for a number of Option Shares that would, as of
the Notice Date, result in a Notional Total Profit of more than the Profit
Cap, and, if the Notional Total Profit associated with exercise of the Option
otherwise would exceed the Profit Cap, the Grantee, at its sole option, may
increase the Exercise Price for that number of Option Shares set forth in the
Exercise Notice so that the Notional Total Profit shall not exceed the Profit
Cap; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this sentence shall restrict any
exercise of the Option otherwise permitted by this Section 6(b) on any
subsequent date at the Exercise Price set forth in Section 2(b) if such
exercise would not then be restricted under this Section 6(b).

7.   LISTING. If the Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock or any other securities
then subject to the Option are then listed on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") or any other national securities exchange, or on the Nasdaq National
Market, the Company, upon the occurrence of an Exercise Event, will promptly
file an application to list on the NYSE or such other securities exchange the
shares of the Santa Fe Snyder Common Stock or other securities then subject
to the Option and will use all reasonable efforts to cause such listing
application to be approved as promptly as practicable.

8.   REPLACEMENT OF AGREEMENT. Upon receipt by the Company of evidence
reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation
of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of
reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation
of this Agreement, if mutilated, the Company will execute and deliver a new
Agreement of like tenor and date. Any such new Agreement shall constitute an
additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the
Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be
enforceable by anyone.

9.   MISCELLANEOUS.

     (a)  EXPENSES. Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement or
as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the parties hereto shall bear
and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of
its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel.

     (b)  WAIVER AND AMENDMENT. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived
at any time by the party that is entitled to the benefits of such provision.
This Agreement may not be modified, amended, altered or supplemented except
upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the
parties hereto.

     (c)  ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY; SEVERABILITY. Except
as otherwise set forth in the Merger Agreement, this Agreement (including the
Merger Agreement and the other documents and instruments referred to herein
and therein) (i) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii) is not intended to confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

                                       7
<PAGE>

     (d)  SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

     (e)  GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law.

     (f)  DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive headings contained herein are
for convenience or reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.

     (g)  NOTICES. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in

     (h)  COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all
of which taken together shall constitute but a single document.

     (i)  ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder or under the Option shall be sold, assigned or
otherwise disposed of or transferred by either of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other party, except that the Grantee may assign this Agreement to a wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Grantee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such assignment
shall have the effect of releasing the Grantee from its obligations

upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

     (j)  FURTHER ASSURANCES. If the Grantee exercises the Option or any

reasonably necessary in order to consummate the transactions provided for by
such exercise.

     (k)  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and
agree that the failure of any party to this Agreement to perform its
agreements and covenants hereunder will cause irreparable injury to the other
party to this Agreement for which damages, even if available, will not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto hereby consents to
the granting of equitable relief (including specific performance and
injunctive relief) by any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any
party's obligations hereunder. The parties further agree to waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any such equitable relief and that this provision is without
prejudice to any other rights that the parties hereto may have for any
failure to perform this Agreement.
