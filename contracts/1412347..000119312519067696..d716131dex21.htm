by Purchaser, as and when finally determined by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant
to the procedures set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale Order,
and not by Sellers; and Sellers and their Affiliates will have no Liability
for any Assumed Cure Costs.

2.6 _Non-Assignment of Assets_. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement will not constitute an
agreement to assign or transfer and will not affect the assignment or transfer
of any Purchased Asset if (i) an attempted assignment or transfer thereof,
without the approval, authorization or consent of, or granting or issuance of
any license or permit by, any third party thereto (each such action, a "
_Necessary Consent_ " or collectively, the " _Necessary Consents_ "),
would constitute a breach, default or violation thereof or of any Law or
Order or in any way adversely affect the rights of Purchaser thereunder and
(ii) the Bankruptcy Court has not entered an Order approving such assignment
or transfer. In such event, such assignment or transfer is subject to such
Necessary Consent being obtained and Sellers and Purchaser will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the Necessary Consents with
respect to any such Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit
arising thereunder for the assignment or transfer thereof to Purchaser as
Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers will
not be obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third party from
whom consent or approval is requested or to initiate any litigation or Legal
Proceedings to obtain any such consent or approval. If such Necessary Consent
is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment or transfer thereof would
be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of Purchaser to such
Purchased Asset following the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser will cooperate in
a mutually agreeable arrangement, to the extent feasible, under which
Purchaser would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in
accordance with this Agreement and the Sale Order.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_, if after the Closing (i) Purchaser
holds any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or (ii) any Seller holds any
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser or the applicable Seller,
will promptly transfer (or cause to be transferred) such assets or assume (or
cause to be assumed) such Liabilities to or from (as the case may be) the
other Party. Prior to any such transfer, the Party receiving or possessing any
such asset will hold it in trust for such other Party.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the
Closing Date, Purchaser will be entitled, in its sole discretion, to remove
any Contract from _Schedule 2.1(b)(v)_ by providing written notice thereof to
Sellers and any Contract so removed will be deemed to be an "Excluded Asset"
for all purposes hereunder.

 

2.7 _Further Conveyances and Assumptions_. From time to time following the
Closing, Sellers and Purchaser will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances,
notices, assumptions, assignments, releases and other instruments, and will
take such further actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
assure fully to Purchaser and its respective successors or assigns, all of
the properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and
privileges intended to be conveyed to Purchaser under this Agreement and to
assure fully to each Seller and its Affiliates and their successors and
assigns, the assumption of the liabilities and obligations intended to be
assumed by Purchaser under this Agreement, and to otherwise make effective the
Transactions; _provided_ , that nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ will
require Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to assume any Liabilities other
than the Assumed Liabilities.

 

III. CONSIDERATION

3.1  _Consideration_. The aggregate consideration for the Purchased Assets
(the " _Purchase Price_ ") will be:

(a) $7,500,000 in cash at Closing (the " _Cash Amount_ ");

(b) A $112,500,000 senior secured promissory note, in form mutually agreed by
the parties, and incorporating the terms set forth in the term sheet attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Senior Note_ "), which will be secured by the
Clarke Guaranty, the Merida Guaranty and other collateral defined in 
_Section_ __ _ 4.3_;

(c) A $95,000,000 junior secured promissory note, in form mutually agreed by
the parties, and incorporating the terms set forth in the term sheet attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Junior Note_ "),

 



-20- 

    

(d) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, together with the Excess Net
Working Capital Payment (if any), which shall be paid as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_.

3.2 _Purchase Price Deposit_. On the date hereof, Purchaser shall deposit
with the Company the sum of $2,500,000 (the " _Deposit Amount_ "), which,
together with any interest having accrued on the Deposit Amount between the
date hereof and such disposition, will be either refunded to Purchaser or
retained by the Company as follows:

(a) if the Closing occurs, the Deposit Amount will be retained by the Company
and applied towards the amount payable by Purchaser under _Section_ __ _
3.1(a)_ hereof;

(b) if this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to _Sectio_ _n_ __ _
4.4(d)_, the Company will be entitled to retain the Deposit Amount, and such
Deposit Amount will be deemed compensation and consideration for entering into
this Agreement; and

(c) if this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than by Sellers
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.4(d)_, the Deposit Amount will be refunded to
Purchaser.

3.3 _Working Capital Payment_. Not later than thirty (30) days following
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser the Net Working
Capital Statement. If the Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the sum of (i)
the Net Working Capital Target _plus_ (ii) $1,000,000, then Purchaser will
promptly (but in no event more than five Business Days) pay to the Company
(by wire transfer of immediately available funds) an amount equal to such
excess (but only, for the avoidance of doubt, if a positive number) (the "
_Excess Net Working Capital Payment_ "). If the sum of (i) the Net Working
Capital Target _minus_ (ii) $1,000,000 exceeds the Closing Net Working
Capital, then the Company will promptly (but in no event more than five
Business Days) pay to Purchaser (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds) an amount equal to such excess (but only, for the avoidance of doubt,
if a positive number) (the " _Net Working Capital Shortfall_ "). In the event
the Purchaser disputes the Net Working Capital Statement, the Purchaser shall
within five Business Days following receipt thereof provide written notice of
such dispute to the Company, including a reasonably detailed explanation
regarding the basis for such dispute. The parties shall thereafter endeavor
in good faith to resolve such dispute on a mutually agreeable basis;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such disputes remain unresolved after ten
Business Days, either party can submit such dispute to BDO USA, LLP (an
independent accounting firm) (the " _Independent Firm_ "), and such
Independent Firm shall make a binding determination (made in accordance with
this Agreement) with respect to such dispute within ten Business Days
following the submission of the dispute thereto. The fees, costs and expenses
of the Independent Firm shall initially be allocated 50% to the Company and
50% to Purchaser; _provided_ that such

 



-21- 

    

 fees, costs and expenses will ultimately be allocated between the Company
and Purchaser in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed
items so submitted to the Independent Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by
such Party (as finally determined by the Firm) bears to the total amount of
disputed items submitted. For example, if the company submits an adjustment of
$1,000 for a specific item, and if Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount
claimed by the Company, and if the Independent Firm ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding the Company $300 of the $500 contested, then the fees,
costs and expenses of the Independent Firm will be allocated 60%
(i.e., 300/500) to Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the Company.

3.4 _Payment of Purchase Price_. At the Closing:

 

(a) Purchaser will pay to Sellers, in immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the Cash Amount, which Cash Amount shall be paid directly to the MLP
Secured Lenders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers and the other MLP
Debtors, as applicable, (i) with the prior written consent of the MLP Secured
Lenders (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), may use a portion of the Cash Amount solely to the extent that
the cash they have on hand is insufficient to pay, subject to the limitations
set forth in the Final Cash Collateral Order, the MLP Debtors
undisputed, accrued and unpaid administrative expenses that arose after the
Petition Date in the ordinary course of business and, to the extent allowed by
the Bankruptcy Court under section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, non-
ordinary course administrative expenses and (ii) with the prior written
consent of the MLP Secured Lenders, may use a portion of the Cash Amount
solely to the extent that the cash the MLP Debtors have on hand is
insufficient to pay, subject to the limitations set forth in the Final Cash
Collateral Order, the MLP Debtors undisputed, allowed priority unsecured
claims.

 

(b) The Deposit Amount will be applied towards the Cash Amount payable by
Purchaser to the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

(c) Purchaser will deliver the Senior Note and the Junior Note.

 

(d) Purchaser will assume the Assumed Liabilities pursuant to instruments
delivered at the Closing as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4.3_.

subcontractor, or leased employee, volunteer, or "temp" of Sellers, or any
group or class of the foregoing, or any Governmental Body, alleging violation
of any labor or employment Law, breach of any Collective Bargaining
Agreement, breach of any express or implied contract of employment, wrongful
termination of employment, or any other discriminatory, wrongful, or tortious
conduct in connection with the employment relationship; (iii) each of the
Employees has presented documentation sufficient under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which they perform employment services for the Sellers
authorizing the Employees to lawfully work within the jurisdictions they
perform employment services for Sellers; and (iv) no individual has been
improperly excluded from, or wrongly denied benefits under, any Benefit Plan.

 

5.12 _Employees_. Sellers do not employ any individual Person. _Schedule
5.12(a)_ contains a complete and accurate list of the Employees as of the
date hereof, including employees work location, union or non-union status,
status as exempt or non-exempt under the provisions of the Fair Labor
Standards Act and other applicable Laws, title, start date and base wage rate
or salary. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.12(b),_ no Seller nor any of its
respective Affiliates sponsors, maintains, contributes to or has any Liability
in respect of any defined benefit pension plan (as defined in Section 3(35)
of ERISA) or any multiemployer plan with respect to the Employees.

 

5.13 _Mining_. Each Seller has, in the amounts and forms required pursuant to
applicable Mining and Mining Safety Laws, obtained all performance bonds and
surety bonds, or otherwise provided any financial assurance as (a) required
under the applicable Permits or Mining and Mining Safety Laws for Reclamation
of land, water or other natural resources at any property included in the
Purchased Assets, or (b) required pursuant to any applicable Permit or Mining
and Mining Safety Law (collectively, " _Mining Financial Assurances_ ").
_Schedule 5.13_ sets forth a complete and accurate list of all Mining
Financial Assurances held by Sellers with respect to the Purchased Assets,
categorized by Transferred Permit/License or the Purchased Assets, and
including the name of the provider, the amount provided, and the amounts of
collateral held by the provider. Except as noted on _Schedule 5.13_ , the
Cash Collateral shown on _Schedule 5.13_ does not secure any obligations or
assets other than the Assumed Liabilities and the

 



-31- 

    

 Purchased Assets. The liability for mine closing and Reclamation obligations
recorded on the most recent balance sheet of Sellers provided to Purchaser has
been properly accrued in accordance with the requirements of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Codification Topic 410, Asset Retirement and
Environmental Obligations, formerly known as Financial Accounting Standard No.
143 (" _FASB 410_ "), and the amount of such liability is equal to or in
excess of the amount of such obligations, determined on the basis of Sellers
actual historic Reclamation and closure costs and currently planned mine life
and escalated for inflation, in accordance with FASB 410 and applicable Law.

5.14 _No Other Representations or Warranties;_ _Schedules_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this _Article V_ (as modified by
the Disclosure Schedules), none of Sellers nor any other Person makes any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Sellers,
the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Transactions, and each
Seller disclaims any other representations or warranties, whether made by
Sellers, any Affiliate of Sellers, or any of Sellers or their Affiliates
respective Representatives. Except for the representations and warranties
contained in this _Article V_ (as modified by the Disclosure Schedules), each
Seller (a) expressly disclaims and negates any representation or warranty,
expressed or implied, at common law, by statute, or otherwise, relating to
the condition of the Purchased Assets (including any implied or expressed
warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, or of
conformity to models or samples of materials) and (b) disclaims all Liability
and responsibility for any representation, warranty, projection, forecast,
statement, or information made, communicated, or furnished (orally or in
writing) to Purchaser or its Affiliates or Representatives (including any
opinion, information, projection, or advice that may have been or may be
provided to Purchaser by any Representative of Sellers or any of its
Affiliates). Sellers make no representations or warranties to Purchaser
regarding the probable success or profitability of the Purchased Assets or
the use thereof. The disclosure of any matter or item in any Schedule hereto
will not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that any such matter is
required to be disclosed or is material or that such matter could result in a
Seller Material Adverse Effect.

this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser and Guarantor acknowledge and agree
that Sellers are not making any representations or warranties whatsoever,
express or implied, beyond those expressly given by Sellers in _Article V_ (as

VII. BANKRUPTCY COURT MATTERS

 

7.1 _Bankruptcy Procedures Order_. Sellers shall take all actions necessary to
timely file this Agreement with Bankruptcy Court and serve a copy on all
applicable notice parties as provided in the Bidding Procedures Order as if
this Agreement were a "Stalking Horse Agreement" (as defined in the Bidding
Procedures Order) under the Bidding Procedures Order.

 

7.2 _Competing Transactions_. This Agreement is subject to the Bankruptcy
Courts and Sellers consideration of higher or better competing bids. From
and after the date hereof until the date that the auction contemplated by the
Bidding Procedures Order is declared closed by Sellers, Sellers are permitted
to cause their respective Representatives and Affiliates to initiate contact
with, or solicit or encourage submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers
by, any Person (in addition to Purchaser and its Affiliates, agents, and
Representatives) with respect to any transaction (or series of transactions)
involving the direct or indirect sale, transfer or other disposition of all,
or a material portion of, the Purchased Assets to a purchaser or purchasers
other than Purchaser or effecting any other transaction (including a chapter
11 plan) the consummation of which would be substantially inconsistent with
the Transactions (a " _Competing Transaction_ "). In addition, Sellers shall
be permitted to respond to any inquiries or offers to purchase all or any part
of the Purchased Assets (whether in combination with other assets of Sellers
or their Affiliates or otherwise) and perform any and all other acts related
thereto which are required or permitted under the Bankruptcy Code, the Bidding
Procedures Order or other applicable Law, including supplying information
relating to the Business and the assets of Sellers to prospective purchasers.

7.3 _Bankruptcy Court Filings_. Sellers will pursue diligently the entry of
the Sale Order, and Purchaser agrees that it will promptly take such actions
as are reasonably requested by Sellers to assist in obtaining entry of the
Sale Order and a finding of adequate assurance of future performance by
Purchaser of the Purchased Contracts, including furnishing affidavits or other
documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court for the
purposes, among others, of providing necessary assurances of performance by
Purchaser under this Agreement and demonstrating that Purchaser is a

 



-35- 

    

 "good faith" purchaser under Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code. Sellers
will use reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser notice in advance of filing
with the Bankruptcy Court or any appellate court any motion, brief, notice,
proposed Order, amendment, supplement or other pleading that Sellers propose
to file in the Bankruptcy Court relating to the Transactions.

 

VIII. COVENANTS

8.1  _Access to Information_.

(a) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Purchaser will be entitled
for purposes of consummating the Transactions to make such investigation of
the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as it reasonably requests.
Any such investigation and examination will be conducted upon reasonable
advance notice and under reasonable circumstances so as not to disturb the
operation of the Business and will be subject to restrictions under applicable
Law. Sellers will direct and use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to cooperate with Purchaser and Purchasers
Representatives in connection with such investigation and examination, and
Purchaser and its Representatives will cooperate with Sellers and their
Representatives. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
such investigation or examination will be permitted to the extent that it
would require Sellers to disclose information that would cause material
competitive harm to a Seller or would violate attorney-client privilege.
Sellers will promptly deliver to Purchaser all pleadings, motions, notices,
statements, schedules, applications, reports and other papers filed in any
other judicial or administrative proceeding related to the Purchased Assets
and the Transactions.

 

(b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall make available and provide access to Sellers, upon reasonable notice
and during normal business hours, to (i) the books and records of the Business
(or copies or extracts thereof) with respect to periods or portions of periods
ending on or before the Closing Date (including the Documents) as may be in
the possession of Purchaser or its Affiliates, and (ii) to the management-
level Transferred Employees, in each case for purposes of complying with
applicable Laws and fulfilling Sellers obligations under this Agreement, and
with respect to pursuing and resolving claims and causes of action that
constitute Excluded Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers access to
Purchasers books and records under pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)_ shall be limited to those books and records that relate solely to the
Business and the Excluded Assets.

 



-36- 

    

8.2 _Actions Pending the Closing_. Except (a) as required by applicable Law or
by Order of the Bankruptcy Court, (b) as otherwise expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, or (c) with the prior written consent of Purchaser, during the
period from the date hereof to and through the Closing Date, Sellers
will: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to carry on the Business in the
Ordinary Course of Business of the Sellers and use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain, preserve and protect the Purchased Assets in their
current condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, but including
replacements, modifications or maintenance in the Ordinary Course of Business
of the Sellers and normal inventories of coal and operating materials and
supplies in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Sellers; (ii) maintain
their books, accounts and records in the Ordinary Course of Business; (iii)
not materially amend, modify, terminate, waive any rights under or create any
Lien (other than a Lien that will not be transferred to Purchaser at the
Closing) with respect to any of the Purchased Contracts; (iv) use commercially
reasonable efforts to defend and protect the Purchased Assets from
infringement or deterioration; (v) comply with applicable Laws with
respect to the Business or any Purchased Assets, other than with respect to
the failure of such compliance as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect; (vi) use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect all
Transferred Permits/Licenses and comply with the terms of each such
Transferred Permit/License and (vii) not enter into any agreement or
commitment to take any action prohibited by this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

8.3 _Consents_. Sellers and Purchaser will use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable date all consents and
approvals contemplated by this Agreement, including the consents and approvals
referred to in _Sections_ _2.6(a)(ii)_ or _5.3_ and the Necessary Consents;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that none of Sellers or Purchaser will be obligated
to pay any consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or
approval is requested or to initiate any litigation or proceedings to obtain
any such consent or approval. 

8.4 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement
and any relevant Order of the Bankruptcy Court, each of Purchaser and each
Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to (a) take all actions necessary
or appropriate to consummate the Transactions, (b) provide the other Parties
with reasonable cooperation and take such actions as such other Parties may
reasonably request in connection with the consummation of the Transactions,
(c) following the Closing, execute and deliver such additional documents,
instruments, assignments, conveyances and assurances, and take such
further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and give effect to the Transactions, and (d) cause the fulfillment at
the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their respective
obligations to consummate the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing,
each of Purchaser and Sellers will use its reasonable best efforts to defend
any Legal Proceedings which would prevent the condition to Closing described
in _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ from being satisfied, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Body with respect thereto vacated or reversed, and will cooperate
with each other in connection with the foregoing. 

 



-37- 

    

8.5 _Transferred Permit/License and Surety Bond Matters_.

 

(a) To the extent permitted by Law, Purchaser shall prepare, at its sole cost
and expense, all applications required to transfer the Transferred
Permits/Licenses (which applications shall include the necessary applications,
notices, forms and other documents to appoint Purchaser as the designated
operator on the Transferred Permits/Licenses with the appropriate
Governmental Body). Sellers shall cooperate with and provide reasonable
assistance to Purchaser in connection with such preparation and such
applications shall be reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. As promptly as
practicable and in no event later than 10 days after the date hereof,
Purchaser shall properly file all applications required to transfer the
Transferred Permits/Licenses from Sellers and their Affiliates to Purchaser
with the appropriate Governmental Body. From and after the date
hereof, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to pursue the prompt
transfer of the Transferred Permits/Licenses to Purchaser. Sellers agree to
provide the cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser to procure the
transfer of the Transferred Permits/Licenses.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_, Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary under all Laws to put in place with the appropriate
Governmental Body as promptly as commercially reasonably possible after the
date hereof (but in no event later than the Closing) the Required Bonding
necessary to transfer the Transferred Permits/Licenses from Sellers and their
Affiliates to Purchaser in such a manner so as to permit the roll over or
termination of all existing reclamation and surety bonds of the Sellers and
underlying bond agreements (and related instruments) related to the
Transferred Permits/Licenses. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the
establishment and maintenance of the Required Bonding. Promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith with
Zurich to effect the roll over, assignment or replacement at Closing of its
Kemmerer reclamation bonds on terms that are not unreasonable to Purchaser and
Zurich.

 

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, from and after the Closing, and
subject to Purchasers obligation under  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ to promptly
effect the transfer of the Transferred Permits/Licenses to Purchaser,
Purchaser shall operate under the Transferred Permits/Licenses as the
designated operator. To the extent allowed by and in accordance with Law,
after the Closing and until the appropriate Governmental Body approves the
transfer of the Transferred Permits/Licenses to Purchaser (the " _Interim
Period_ "), Sellers grant Purchaser the right to conduct, at the sole cost
and expense of Purchaser, mining operations following the Closing on the
Purchased Real Property under the Transferred Permits/Licenses as the
designated operator. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers,
Sellers Affiliates, Westmoreland Coal Company and its Affiliates for (i) all
activities or omissions of Purchaser on the Purchased Real Property, and (ii)
any Liabilities incurred with respect to such bonds or 

 



-38- 

    

 other financial assurances resulting from the actions or omissions of
Purchaser or its Affiliates while operating under the Transferred
Permits/Licenses, in each case, during the Interim Period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent Purchaser operates under any Transferred
Permits/Licenses during the Interim Period prior to the transfer of such to
Purchaser, Purchaser shall, at its sole cost and expense, (x) until such time
as Purchaser has posted replacement surety bonds or other financial
assurances, pay or reimburse the Sellers (promptly upon receipt of notice from
the Sellers, which such notice shall contain the applicable surety bond
numbers and corresponding premium amounts) for the cost of any premiums that
become due after the Closing Date for post-Closing periods with respect to
such surety bonds or other financial assurances, and (y) post any addition to
the principal amount of any such surety bond or other financial assurance
required by any Governmental Body after the Closing Date as a result of any
action taken by Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect to the Purchased
Assets. Purchaser and Sellers will make such filings, applications, notices
or deliver any other documents as necessary to give effect to the foregoing
arrangement during the Interim Period.

(d) During the Interim Period, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to: (i) maintain such Transferred Permit/License and comply with
all Laws governing, and all conditions and requirements of, or pertaining to,
any such Transferred Permits/Licenses (which shall include the performance of
all actions required by applicable Laws and all conditions and requirements of
the Transferred Permit/License); and (ii) be solely responsible (including all
required remedial measures or abatement actions) for all incidents of
violation, non-compliance, and similar occurrences related to the Transferred
Permits/Licenses that arise from the actions of Purchaser and its Affiliates
and their respective agents, Representatives and business relations while
operating under such Transferred Permits/Licenses during the Interim Period.
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Sellers written notice of any such
incidents or occurrences. In the event the Purchaser fails to cure any such
matters, Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure such
matters (including right of entry onto the applicable Purchased Real
Property). Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Sellers for the reasonable
costs of any such cure. Sellers shall have (and Purchaser shall grant) all
reasonable rights of entry onto the Purchased Real Property necessary for
Sellers to maintain the Transferred Permits/Licenses in the event Purchaser
fails to maintain the Transferred Permits/Licenses during the Interim Period.

(e) Upon the completion of the transfer of each applicable Transferred
Permit/License, Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller to (i) secure the prompt
termination of the applicable reclamation and surety bonds of Seller related
thereto, (ii) secure prompt the termination of the underlying bond agreement
(and related instruments) related to the Transferred Permit/License (to the
extent all Transferred Permits/Licenses subject to the applicable bond
agreement (or related instrument) have been transferred to Purchaser), and
(iii) to secure the prompt release of the related Cash Collateral.

 



-39- 

    

(f) The above notwithstanding, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
remain liable for the Assumed Liabilities related to the Transferred
Permits/Licenses even if any applicable Governmental Body fails to approve the
transfers of any of the Transferred Permits/Licenses to Purchaser.

 

8.6 _Publicity_. Prior to Closing, unless otherwise required by applicable Law
or Bankruptcy Court requirement, Purchaser and Sellers shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or public announcement concerning
this Agreement or the Transactions, and shall not issue any such release or
make any such statement without the prior written consent of the other
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
_provided_ , _however_ , that such requirement shall not apply to Sellers with
respect to any actions taken with respect to a Competing Transaction. From and
after the Closing, the Purchaser and Sellers may make public statements with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions so long as such announcements do
not disclose the specific terms or conditions of this Agreement, except where
such terms and conditions have already been disclosed as required by Law or
Bankruptcy Court requirement; _provided_ , that the issuing party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party with
respect to the text thereof to the extent practicable.

8.7 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser acknowledges that Confidential Information
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) has been, and in the future
will be, provided to it in connection with this Agreement, including under
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, and is subject to the terms of the confidentiality
agreement dated August 25, 2018 between the Company and Purchaser (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Purchaser acknowledges and understands that this Agreement may be
publicly filed in the Bankruptcy Court and further made available by Sellers
to prospective bidders and that, except as prohibited herein, such disclosure
will not be deemed to violate any confidentiality obligations owing to
Purchaser, whether pursuant to this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
or otherwise.

8.8 _Transaction Documents_. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith, prior
to the Closing (and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause Westmoreland Coal Company, or the acquiror of substantially all of its
assets, to negotiate, in the case of the Transition Services Agreement), the
terms of the General Assignments and Bills of Sales, the Lease Assignment and
Assumption Agreements, the Senior Note, the Junior Note, the Clarke Guaranty,
the Merida Guaranty, the Transition Services Agreement and each other
document, agreement or instrument executed and delivered in
connection herewith or therewith, and in each case such terms shall be in a
form (a) customary for transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement
and (b) reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Purchaser (and, in the case
of the Senior Note and the Junior Note, to the MLP Secured Lenders), in their
respective discretion. Purchaser shall agree to enter into each of the General
Assignments and Bills of Sales, the Lease Assignment and Assumption
Agreements, the Senior Note, the Junior Note and each other document,

 



-40- 

    

 agreement or instrument executed and delivered in connection herewith or
therewith, to the extent such document (i) is in a form customary for
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) with respect to
the Senior Note, is consistent with the terms set forth in the term sheet
attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto, (iii) with respect to the Junior Note, is
consistent with the terms set forth in the term sheet attached as _Exhibit B_
hereto, and (iv) with respect to any other document contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 8.8_, is reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser.

-42- 

    

(a) there shall not be in effect any Order restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions;

(b) the Bankruptcy Court shall have entered the Sale Order;

 

(c) the Bankruptcy Court shall have granted the debtors in the Bankruptcy Case
the authority to reject all retiree medical obligations related to the
Purchased Assets pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 1114, and either (i) Purchaser and
the UMWA have reached agreement on terms and conditions for a modified
collective bargaining agreement or (ii) the Bankruptcy Court shall have
granted the debtors in the Bankruptcy Case the authority to reject the
existing collective bargaining agreement related to the Business and to impose
the terms set forth in the debtors January 9, 2019 proposal; and

 

(d) Zurich shall have agreed to assign or replace all of its existing Mining
Financial Assurances at Closing on terms not unreasonable to Purchaser and
Zurich, or one or more other sureties selected by Purchaser shall have issued
replacement bonds for all such Zurich bonds on terms not unreasonable to
Purchaser.

 

9.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions._ No Party may rely on the failure of
any condition set forth in _Sections 9.1_ , _9.2_ or  _9.2_ _(_ e), as the
case may be, if such failure was caused by such Partys breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

X. TAXES

10.1 _Transfer Taxes_.

 

(a) All documentary, stamp, transfer, motor vehicle registration, sales, use,
value added, excise and other similar non-income Taxes and all filing and
recording fees (and any penalties and interest associated with such Taxes and
fees) arising from or relating to the consummation of the Transactions
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne by Purchaser, regardless
of the Party on whom Liability is imposed under the provisions of the Laws
relating to such Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Purchaser will consult and
cooperate in timely preparing and making all filings, Tax Returns, reports
and forms as may be required to comply with the provisions of the Laws
relating to such Transfer Taxes and will cooperate and otherwise use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any available refunds for or
exemptions from such Transfer Taxes, including preparing exemption
certificates and other instruments as are applicable to claim available
exemptions from the payment of Transfer Taxes under applicable Law and
executing and delivering such affidavits and forms as are reasonably
requested by the other Party.

 



-43- 

    

10.2 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but no later than 120
days thereafter, Purchaser will prepare and deliver to Sellers an allocation
schedule setting forth the amounts to be allocated among Sellers and among the
Purchased Assets of each Seller, pursuant to (and to the extent necessary to
comply with) Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable
regulations promulgated thereunder (or, if applicable, any similar provision
under state, local or foreign Law or regulation) (the " _Proposed Allocation
Statement_ "). Sellers will have 30 Business Days following delivery of the
Proposed Allocation Statement during which to notify Purchaser in writing (an
" _Allocation Notice of Objection_ ") of any objections to the Proposed
Allocation Statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of their
objections. If Sellers fail to deliver an Allocation Notice of Objection in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ the Proposed Allocation
Statement will be conclusive and binding on all Parties and will become the "
_Final Allocation Statement_." If Sellers submit an Allocation Notice of
Objection, then for 20 Business Days after the date Purchaser receives the
Allocation Notice of Objection, Purchaser and Sellers will use their
reasonable best efforts to agree on the allocations. Failing such agreement
within 20 Business Days of such notice, the unresolved allocations will be
submitted to an independent, internationally-recognized accounting firm
mutually agreeable to Purchaser and Sellers, which firm will be instructed to
determine its best estimate of the allocation schedule based on its
determination of the unresolved allocations and provide a written description
of the basis for its determination within 45 Business Days after submission,
such written determination to be final, binding and conclusive. The fees and
expenses of such accounting firm will be apportioned among Sellers and
Purchaser equally. For the avoidance of doubt, in administering any Legal
Proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court shall not be required to apply the Final
Allocation Statement in determining the manner in which the Purchase Price
should be allocated as between Sellers and their respective estates.

 

(b) Sellers and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates will report, act,
and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to IRS Form 8594) in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with the Final Allocation Statement.
Neither Sellers nor Purchaser will take any position (whether in audits, tax
returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation
Statement unless required to do so by applicable Law.

10.3 _Cooperation and Audits_. Purchaser, its Affiliates and Sellers will
cooperate fully with each other regarding Tax matters (including the
execution of appropriate powers of attorney) and will make available to the
other as reasonably requested all information, records and documents relating
to Taxes governed by this Agreement until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations or extension thereof or the conclusion of all audits,
appeals or litigation with respect to such Taxes.

XI. OTHER AGREEMENTS

 

11.1 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser or a Designated Purchaser shall make
offers of employment to all Employees as of the Closing Date. The Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Westmoreland Coal
Company to, as of the Closing Date, terminate the employment of each Employee
and shall cooperate with, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
assist, Purchaser with Purchasers hiring (effective as of the Closing Date)
of such Employees. The Purchaser shall be responsible for all Liabilities
under the WARN Act. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall set initial
terms and conditions of employment, including wages, benefits, job duties and
responsibilities and work assignment for the non-Union Employees (but
excluding severance), all of which shall be substantially similar to those of
such non-Union Employee prior to the Closing Date. For any Employees who are
represented by a Union, offers of employment by Purchaser or a Designated
Purchaser shall be in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement
adopted by Purchaser. With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time,
and/or paid time off of any Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume the Liability for such accrued vacation
and/or paid time off and allow such Transferred Employee to use such accrued
vacation and/or paid time off, in the same manner as provided under such
vacation and/or paid time off policy, as applicable, immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 12.10_, the provisions
of this _Article XI_ are included for the sole benefit of the Sellers and
Purchaser and nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any
third party beneficiary or other rights in any other Person, including in any
current or former employee, independent contractor or other service provider
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Sellers or
Westmoreland Coal Company in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment) with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or the Business and no
provision of this _Article XI_ shall create any rights in any such Persons in
respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any employee plan, Purchaser Plan or any plan or arrangement that may be
established by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. No provision of this
Agreement shall constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify or
terminate after the Closing Date any such plans or arrangements of the
Sellers, Westmoreland Coal Company, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates.

XII. MISCELLANEOUS

 

12.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The Parties agree that
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement will not
survive the Closing hereunder, and none of the Parties will have any Liability
to each other after the Closing for any breach thereof. The Parties agree that
the covenants contained in this Agreement to be performed at or after the
Closing will survive the Closing hereunder until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations or for such shorter period explicitly
specified therein, and each Party will be liable to the other after the
Closing for any breach thereof.

12.2 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each of Sellers on the one
hand and Purchaser and Guarantor on the other hand will bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and all proceedings
incident thereto.

12.3 _Injunctive Relief_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damages would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that damages at law may
be an inadequate remedy for the breach of any of the covenants, promises and
agreements contained in this Agreement, and, accordingly, any Party will
be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent any such breach, and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including specific
performance of such covenants, promises or agreements or an Order enjoining a
Party from any threatened, or from the continuation of any actual, breach of
the covenants, promises or agreements contained in this Agreement. The rights
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 12.3_ will be in addition to any other
rights which a Party may have at law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) The Parties hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by Purchaser, Guarantor or Sellers, as applicable,
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the respective covenants and obligations of Purchaser, Guarantor or Sellers,
as applicable, under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this 
_Section_ __ _ 12.3_.

12.4 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Proces_ s.

 

(a) Without limiting any Partys right to appeal any Order of the Bankruptcy
Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court will retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce
the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims or disputes, which may
arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any breach or
default hereunder, or the Transactions, and (ii) any and all proceedings
related to the foregoing will be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy
Court, and the Parties hereby consent to and submit to the jurisdiction and
venue of the Bankruptcy Court for such purposes and will receive 

 



-46- 

    

 notices at such locations as indicated in _Section_ __ _ 12.8_ hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Bankruptcy Case has been closed pursuant
to Section 350 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Parties agree to unconditionally
and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or in the event (but only in the event) that such court does not have
subject matter jurisdiction over such Legal Proceeding in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court from any
thereof, for the resolution of any such claim or dispute. The Parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for
the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the Parties agrees that a judgment in
any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby consents to process being served by any other
Party in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a copy thereof in
accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 12.8_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service will not be effective until the actual receipt
thereof by the Party being served.

 

12.5 _Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury_. Each Party to this Agreement waives
any right to trial by jury in any action, matter or proceeding regarding this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

12.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement represents
the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions and agreements
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement
can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be
waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement
signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to
this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, will
be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein.
The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will
not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach
or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of
any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other
remedies provided by Law.

 



-47- 

    

12.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with federal bankruptcy Law, to the extent applicable, and, where
state Law is implicated, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts made and performed in such State.

 

12.8 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement will
be in writing and will be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by hand,

12.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal,
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

12.10 _Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Except as set forth in _Sections 8.5(c)_ and _12.11_ nothing in this Agreement
will create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Person or entity not a party to this Agreement. No assignment of this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by either
Sellers on the one hand or Purchaser or Guarantor on the other hand (by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Parties and any attempted assignment without the required consents will be
void, _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall be entitled to designate,
in accordance with the terms and subject to the limitations set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 12.10_, one or more Affiliates to (i) purchase the
Purchased Assets and/or (ii) assume the Assumed Liabilities, on and after the
Closing Date (any such Affiliate of Purchaser that shall be
properly designated by Purchaser in accordance with this clause, a "
_Designated Purchaser_ "); it being understood and agreed, however, that any
such right of Purchaser to designate a Designated Purchaser is conditioned
upon (a) such Designated Purchaser executing and delivering to Sellers a
counterpart to this Agreement, (b) such Designated Purchaser being able to
perform the applicable covenants under this Agreement (and make the same
representations and warranties as Purchaser has made in _Section_ __ _ 6.6_,
to the extent relating to the relevant portion of the Purchased Assets being
acquired by such Designated Purchaser), and demonstrate satisfaction of the
applicable requirements of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (to the extent
applicable), including the provision of adequate assurance for future
performance, with respect to the applicable assumed Contracts and the assumed
Leases, (c) any such designation not creating any Liability (including any
Liability relating to Taxes) for Sellers or their Affiliates that would not
have existed had Purchaser purchased the Purchased Assets and/or assumed the
Assumed Liabilities, and which Liability is (i) not fully reimbursed by or on
behalf of Purchaser prior to or at the Closing or (ii) a Liability for which
Purchaser or the applicable Designated Purchaser agrees, at its election, to
provide an indemnity reasonably acceptable to Sellers, and (d) such
designation not reasonably being expected to materially delay, prevent or
hinder the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
such designation

 



-49- 

    

 shall relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder. Any breach
hereof by a Designated Purchaser shall be deemed a breach by Purchaser. The
above designation shall be made by Purchaser by way of a written notice to be
delivered to Sellers as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof
and in no event later than the fifth (5th) day prior to the Closing Date,
which written notice shall contain appropriate information about
the Designated Purchaser(s) and shall indicate which Purchased Assets and
Assumed Liabilities that Purchaser intends such Designated Purchaser(s) to
purchase and/or assume, as applicable, hereunder. Upon any such permitted
assignment, the references in this Agreement to Sellers or Purchaser will
also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers may assign some or all of its rights or
delegate some or all of its obligations hereunder to successor entities
(including any liquidating trust) pursuant to a chapter 11 plan confirmed by
the Bankruptcy Court.

12.11 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, equityholder, incorporator, manager, agent,
attorney, Representative or Affiliate of the parties to this Agreement or any
of their Affiliates or Westmoreland Coal Company and its Affiliates will have
any Liability for any obligations or Liabilities of Sellers or Purchaser, as
applicable, under this Agreement or any agreement entered into in
connection herewith of or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Any claim or cause of
action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or any
agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby may only be brought
against Persons that are expressly named as Parties or thereto, and then only
with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein or therein. Other
than the Parties, no other party will have any Liability or obligation for
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or
Liabilities of any Party under this Agreement or the agreements, documents or
instruments contemplated hereby or of or for any Legal Proceeding based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, Transactions (including the breach,
termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each case whether
based on contract, tort, fraud, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and
whether by piercing the corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a Party
or another Person or otherwise. In no event will any Person be liable to
another Person for any remote, speculative or punitive damages with respect to
the Transactions.

 

12.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of
which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.

12.13 _Merida Guaranty_. Guarantor hereby unconditionally, absolutely and
irrevocably guaranties the full and punctual payment and performance of any
and all obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement and all other
Transaction Documents (excluding the Junior Note, which is not guaranteed) as
and when such payment or

 



-50- 

    

 performance shall become due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents, as applicable. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in a Transaction Document, this Agreement is a guaranty
of payment and performance and not merely of collectability and is in no way
conditioned upon any attempt to collect from or proceed against the Purchaser
or any other Person or any other event or circumstance. The obligations of
Guarantor under this Agreement are direct and primary obligations, and a
separate action or actions may be brought against Guarantor regardless of
whether action is brought against the Purchaser or any other Person, except
as otherwise specifically provided in a Transaction Document. In any legal
action to enforce the obligations of Guarantor hereunder, Guarantor shall be
responsible for all reasonable and documented fees and expenses incurred
by Sellers in connection with such enforcement.
