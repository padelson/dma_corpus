ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

SECTION 3.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the
Buyer, Merger Sub or any other Person:

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will automatically be converted into one fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each share of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) that is owned by the
Company or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or (ii) that is owned by the
Buyer or Merger Sub (collectively, the "Excluded Shares") will automatically
be canceled, retired and cease to exist without payment of any consideration
with respect thereto.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock
(including restricted stock granted under the Stock Plans) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) will, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive (i) that fraction of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of Buyer Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock
Consideration") and (ii) an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
Cash Consideration (the Cash Consideration, together with the  



 

11  Stock Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"), whereupon such shares of
Common Stock will no longer be outstanding, and each holder of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section
3.4. The Stock Consideration using the Exchange Ratio shall be calculated to
the nearest one-ten thousandth of a share of Buyer Common Stock.

SECTION 3.2 _Dissenters  Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are owned by Company Stockholders who are entitled to
elect, and have properly elected, to dissent pursuant to Section 101 of the
MIBCA (the "Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto, unless and until such
Company Stockholders fail to perfect their right to dissent under applicable
Law or otherwise lose their right to payment as dissenting stockholders under
the MIBCA, but, instead, such Company Stockholders will be entitled to payment
of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 101 of
the MIBCA. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of
a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. If any such Company Stockholders
fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose such right to dissent, each
share of Common Stock held by such Company Stockholder will thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into the right to receive and become
exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration with respect
thereto, in the manner provided for in Section 3.1, without interest or
dividends thereon.

(b) The Company will give Buyer (i) prompt notice of any elections to dissent
filed pursuant to Section 101 of the MIBCA received by the Company,
withdrawals of such elections and any other instruments served or delivered in
connection with such elections pursuant to the MIBCA and received by
the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to elections under Section 101 of the MIBCA
consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder. Neither the Company
nor the Surviving Corporation will, except with the prior consent of the
Buyer, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

SECTION 3.3 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent (as applicable).



 

12 SECTION 3.4 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer
will designate a bank or trust company (which bank or trust company will be
reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as exchange and payment agent
(the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares for the applicable Merger Consideration set forth in Section
3.1(c). At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall have deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Exchange Agent (1) the number of fully paid,
non-assessable shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the number of shares
of Common Stock (including restricted stock granted under the Stock Plans)
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) _multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio and (2) an
amount of cash equal to the number of shares of Common Stock (including
restricted stock granted under the Stock Plans) outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares)
_multiplied by_ the Cash Consideration (such Buyer Common Stock and cash
deposited by the Buyer are referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund")
and the Buyer will deposit into the Exchange Fund from time to time an amount
in cash sufficient to pay any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of
Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.4(e) and any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to Buyer Common Stock to which the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares of Common Stock may be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 3.4(c). The amount of any cash deposited into the
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that such investments will be (A) in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or of any agency
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, (B) in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation or
(C) in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of,
repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits
purchased from, commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and
undivided profits aggregating more than $1.0 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the SEC
or otherwise); _provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon will
affect the Merger Consideration payable to former Company Stockholders under
this Agreement, and the Buyer will promptly provide, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the former Company Stockholders in the amount of any
such losses. The Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose, except
as provided in the Agreement.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event, no later than five Business Days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation will cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of (i) an outstanding
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Common Stock (including restricted stock granted under
the Stock Plans) (other than shares of Common Stock owned by the Buyer or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Dissenting Shares) (the
"Certificates") or (ii) shares of Common Stock represented by book-entry (the
"Book-Entry Shares"), (x) a form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
surrender of such shares of Common Stock (which will be in customary form and
will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only  



 

13  upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in
the letter of transmittal) and (y) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
surrender of such shares of Common Stock in exchange for the Merger
Consideration therefor. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of Book-Entry
Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent will distribute from the Exchange
Fund to the holder of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, or as otherwise
directed in the letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration for
each share of Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, and such Certificate or Book-Entry Share will forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any portion of the Merger
Consideration consisting of a cash payment in respect of any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it will be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered will be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment will have paid all
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or will have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable.

(c) _Dividends on Buyer Common Stock._ Any dividend or other distribution
declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to
Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall include
a dividend or other distribution in respect to all whole shares of Buyer
Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Buyer
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until such
holder surrenders such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
this Section 3.4. Following the surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, there shall be paid to the record holder thereof, without interest, at
the time of surrender the amount of any dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such
shares of Buyer Common Stock.

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Promptly following the one year
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be entitled
to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of Buyer Common
Stock and any cash amounts remaining in the Exchange Fund which had been made
available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income received by the
Exchange Agent in respect of all cash amounts made available to it), and
thereafter such holders who have not received the Merger Consideration
therefor may surrender such Certificate or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
such shares of Common Stock to the Surviving Corporation and, subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws, receive in consideration
therefor the aggregate Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, such
shares of Common Stock held by them, without interest or dividends thereon.



 

14 (e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or
other evidence of ownership thereof will be issued in connection with the
Merger; instead the Buyer will pay to each holder of Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock (after
taking into account and aggregating all shares or fractional shares of Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled) an amount in cash (without interest)
determined by multiplying such fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock by
the Buyer Common Stock Value.

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of a Certificate or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, such shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or book-entry. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company will be closed, and there will be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, such shares of Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for transfer or any other reason, they will
be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article III.

(g) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent will
be liable to any Company Stockholder or other person in respect of any
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by Company Stockholders as of a date that is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Buyer free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto. 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation or
Exchange Agent will, upon the receipt of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation or Exchange Agent, as the case may be, pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Common Stock previously evidenced by such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate; _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate.

SECTION 3.5 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, (i) the outstanding Buyer Common Stock or Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different class
by reason of any reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split, split-up, combination or exchange of shares or other similar
transaction or (ii) a stock dividend or dividend payable in any securities
(including any  



 

15  dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Buyer Common Stock)
shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any similar
event shall have occurred, then the Stock Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

ARTICLE IV

statement contained in this Article IV is true and correct, except as set
forth (i) in the SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (other than any
forward looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, any
disclosures in any section relating to forward looking statements and
any other disclosures included therein to the extent they are primarily
predictive or forward-looking in nature) or (ii) in the Schedules accompanying
this Agreement (collectively, the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). The
Company Disclosure Schedule has been arranged for purposes of convenience
only, in sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement. Each
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule will be deemed to
incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any other section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent that such information is relevant to such other section or
subsection.

SECTION 4.1 _Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power_. The Company is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and has all requisite corporate
power and authority, directly or indirectly, to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing would not be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing (where applicable), in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties or assets owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had and would not be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.2 _Subsidiaries; Joint Ventures_.

(a) A true and complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company, together with
the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of each such Subsidiary, the
authorized and issued capital stock or other ownership interest of each such
Subsidiary and the name of each holder thereof is set forth in  _Section
4.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_. A true and complete list of each
Joint Venture, together with the ownership interest of the Company therein,
the jurisdiction of formation of each such Joint Venture, and the
identity and ownership interest of the Persons that are the other joint
venture partners therein, is set forth on _Section 1.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_. Except as set forth in _Section 4.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
ownership interests of each Subsidiary of the Company and each Joint Venture,
to the extent owned by the Company, are owned, directly or indirectly, by the
Company, free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens). Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
 



 

16  any of the Joint Ventures owns, directly or indirectly, any equity or other
ownership interest in any Person, except for the Subsidiaries of the Company
and the Joint Ventures. Except as set forth on _Section 4.2(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_, the Company is not subject to any obligation or
requirement to provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan,
capital contribution or otherwise) in any such Person.

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each
Joint Venture is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, and has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be
in good standing would not be reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary of the Company
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each Joint Venture is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties or assets owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had and would not be
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.3 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares
of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, of which

that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided
to in advance of a vote on the Merger and this Agreement and, if as of the
time for which the Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient Company Stockholders
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such Special Meeting or to obtain the Stockholder
Approval or there are insufficient votes to approve the Merger, the Company,
with the consent of the Buyer, may and, at the direction of the Buyer, shall,
adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting; _provided_ , however, that unless
this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company
shall be obligated to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Special
Meeting, regardless of the commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to the Company of any Transaction Proposal, or of any Change of
Recommendation.

(e) Promptly following the Closing, the Buyer will file a post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement and will include in such post-
effective amendment a prospectus covering the resale from time to time by each
director or officer of the Company, who serves as a director of the Buyer
following the Closing, of all shares of Buyer Common Stock received by him as
part of the Stock Consideration. The Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such post-effective amendment to be declared
effective as promptly as practicable and to keep such registration statement,
as so amended, effective and such resale prospectus current and available for
use by each such director of the Buyer until such director sells all such
shares of Buyer Common Stock or ceases to be a director of the Buyer. In lieu
of filing a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, the Buyer
may file and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be declared
effective as promptly as practicable, and to keep effective as provided above,
a registration statement on Form F-3 (or on another appropriate Form)
containing a prospectus covering resales of such shares of Buyer Common Stock
which prospectus the Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
keep current and available for resales from time to time by each such
director of the Buyer of all such shares of Buyer Common Stock.

cause the shares of the Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing.

SECTION 7.4 _Regulatory Matters and Approvals_.

(a) Each of the Buyer and the Company will, as promptly as practicable and

any other filings, reports, information and documentation required for the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to any Other Antitrust Laws or
any other applicable Laws; _provided_ , if a competition filing is required
to be made with the European Commission, only the initial draft of such filing
shall be made within ten Business Days following execution of this Agreement.
Each of the Buyer and the Company will furnish to each others counsel such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act, any Other Antitrust Laws and any other applicable Laws.
The Company and the Buyer together will be responsible for all filing fees
payable in connection with such filings.

(b) Each of the Buyer and the Company will use its respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain promptly any clearance required under the HSR
Act, any Other Antitrust Laws and any other applicable Laws for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will
keep each other apprised of the status of any material communications with,
and any reasonable inquiries or requests for additional information from any
Governmental Entity and will comply promptly with any such inquiry or request
from any such Governmental Entity. The Buyer agrees to take any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other party so as to enable
the parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger), including consenting to any divestiture or
other structural or conduct relief in order to obtain clearance from any
Governmental Entity; _provided_ that the Buyer shall not be required to take
any step that if taken would have a Material Adverse Effect (without giving
effect to the proviso contained therein) on the Buyer or the
business operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Subject to the
foregoing provision, at the request of Company, the Buyer and its Affiliates
will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest,
administratively or in court, any ruling, order or other action of any
Governmental Entity or any other Person respecting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



 

48 (c) Subject to Section 7.4(a), each of the Buyer and the Company agrees to
instruct their respective counsel to cooperate with each other and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate and expedite the
identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR Act, any
Other Antitrust Laws and any other applicable Laws at the earliest
practicable dates. Such commercially reasonable efforts and cooperation will
include causing its counsel (i) to inform promptly the other of any oral
communication with, and provide (as permitted) copies of
written communications (excluding competitively sensitive information) with,
any Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or applications or any such
transaction, and (ii) to confer with each other regarding appropriate contacts
with and response to personnel of such Governmental Entity. None of the
Buyer, the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates will independently
contact any Governmental Entity or participate in any meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, applications,
investigation or other inquiry without giving, in the case of the Buyer and
its Affiliates, the Company, and in the case of the Company and its
Affiliates, the Buyer, prior notice of the meeting and, to the

attend and participate (which, at the request of the Buyer or the Company, as
applicable, will be limited to outside antitrust counsel only).

SECTION 7.5 _Consents_. The Company will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each

deliver to the Buyer evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer of the
resignation of all directors of the Company effective at the Effective Time.

efforts to cause its articles of incorporation to be amended at or prior to
Closing by adding a new Article TWELFTH thereto in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit C_ (as amended, the "Amended Articles").

(a) The Buyer hereby agrees to comply with the requirements set forth in
Article TWELFTH of the Amended Articles, including by, in the event that any
of the members of the Special Class (as defined in the Amended Articles)

the Closing, using best efforts to cause any replacement for such director
designated by the Designation Committee (as defined in the Amended Articles)
to be promptly appointed or elected to the Buyer Board as a member of the
Special Class.

(b) The Buyer hereby agrees, prior to the first anniversary of the Closing,
not to take any action (or fail to take any action) to amend Article TWELFTH

and ending at the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, the Company will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of the Joint Ventures to, permit the Buyer and its
Representatives to have (at the Buyers expense) reasonable access at all
reasonable times, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal
business operations of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and Joint
Ventures, to the officers, directors, personnel, customers, suppliers,
premises, properties, books, records, Contracts and documents of or pertaining
to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures as the Buyer may
reasonably request in writing; _provided_ , the Buyer will not have access to
information that is subject to attorney-client privilege or other privilege;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such access will comply with all applicable Laws
and all applicable Real Property Leases and shall not include any intrusive
testing or environmental sampling of any kind.

(b) The Company will give prompt written notice to the Buyer of any event
that has had or would reasonably be expected to give rise to, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Buyer and Merger Sub will
give prompt written notice to the Company of any event that would reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
the Company, the Buyer and Merger Sub will give prompt written notice to the
other parties of any facts relating to such party which would make it
necessary or advisable to amend the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement in order to make the statements therein not misleading or to comply
with applicable Law. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
7.9(b) will not limit, expand or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder (if any) to the party receiving such notice.

(c) Each of Buyer and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective
Representatives to, hold and treat and will cause its officers, employees,
auditors and other authorized Representatives to hold and treat in confidence

2007, between the Company and Buyer (the "Buyer Confidentiality Agreement"),
which Buyer Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms until the Effective Time, at which time it will
terminate. The Buyer Confidentiality Agreement will be deemed amended as of
the date hereof to the effect that the Buyer will be permitted to (i)
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) enforce its rights
hereunder and under the Voting Agreements.

SECTION 7.10 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company will, will cause each of its Subsidiaries and Representatives
to, and will direct the Joint Ventures to, cease immediately any existing
activities, discussions and negotiations with any Person (other than the
Buyer, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives) regarding a
Transaction Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information previously provided in connection therewith and
otherwise enforce its rights under the applicable confidentiality and/or
standstill agreements.

  

 

50 (b) From and after the date of this Agreement, without the prior consent of
the Buyer, the Company will not and will cause its Subsidiaries and its
controlled Affiliates not to, nor will it authorize or permit any of its other
Affiliates or the Joint Ventures or any Representatives of the Company, its
Subsidiaries, its Affiliates or the Joint Ventures to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of

would reasonably be expected to constitute, a Transaction Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations (including by way of furnishing
information) regarding any Transaction Proposal or (iii) otherwise cooperate
in any way with, or assist or participate in, knowingly facilitate or

foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company and its Representatives from (A) during the
Applicable Period, contacting and engaging in discussions with any Person who
has made an unsolicited written Transaction Proposal that does not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 7.10 solely for the purpose of
clarifying such Transaction Proposal and any material terms and conditions
thereof so as to determine whether such Transaction Proposal is, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal; or (B) during the
Applicable Period, if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor), that the
Transaction Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (x)
furnishing information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Joint Ventures to the Person making such Transaction Proposal (provided such
Person has entered into a confidentiality agreement containing similar terms
to those contained in the Buyer Confidentiality Agreement and containing
additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the
terms of this Section 7.10 (a copy of which confidentiality agreement shall be
promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) provided to the Buyer))
and (y) participating in discussions or negotiations regarding such
Transaction Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company may only take such action
specified in clause (B) above if such Transaction Proposal did not
result from a breach of this Section 7.10 and the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that the failure to
take any such action would breach its fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders.

 

(c) Without the prior consent of the Buyer, the Company Board will not (i)
withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to the Buyer, the Board Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or

approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement (other than entry into a confidentiality
agreement contemplated by Section 7.10(b)) related to any Transaction Proposal
or Superior Proposal (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") or propose publicly or
agree to do any of the foregoing, other than pursuant to the next sentence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Applicable Period, (x) 



 

51  if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel) that it would breach its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders not to take any action specified in clause (i) of the
preceding sentence, it may take such action specified in clause (i) of the
preceding sentence and/or (y) in response to a Superior Proposal, if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel) that the failure to take any action specified in clause (ii), (iii),
(iv) or (v) of the preceding sentence would breach its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders, it may take such action specified in clause (ii),
(iii), (iv) or (v) of the preceding sentence (any such action referred to in
clauses (x) or (y), a "Change in Recommendation"), but only, with respect
to the actions set forth in clause (y) at a time that is during the
Applicable Period and is not less than three Business Days following the
Buyers receipt of notice advising the Buyer that the Company Board is
prepared to take such action, specifying the terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (including a copy of any relevant Acquisition Agreement);
_provided_ , that, if requested in writing by the Buyer, the Company shall
negotiate in good faith with the Buyer during such three Business Day notice
period to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that the Company would be able to proceed without making a Change in
Recommendation.

(d) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 7.10, the Company will promptly (and no more than two Business Days
after receipt) advise the Buyer of the receipt of any Transaction Proposal
(and any material modification of or amendment to such a Transaction
Proposal), or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Transaction Proposal or of any request for information in connection with a
possible Transaction Proposal, including the material terms and conditions of
such Transaction Proposal, inquiry or request and the identity of the Person
making such Transaction Proposal, inquiry or request, and will keep the Buyer
reasonably and promptly informed of the status and material details of any
such Transaction Proposal, inquiry or request and the substance of any
discussions and/or material changes relating thereto.

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.10 will prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer) or (ii) from making any other disclosure to
the Company Stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board,
failure to make such disclosure would breach its obligations under applicable
Law; _provided_ that a Change in Recommendation can only be made in accordance
with Section 7.10(c)

SECTION 7.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Until the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Effective Time (the
"Benefits Continuation Period"), the Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to provide, for

employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture, or
any Representative of any such employee, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any period or terms of
employment, of any nature whatsoever; (B) be interpreted to prevent
or restrict the Buyer or its Affiliates from modifying or terminating the
employment or terms of employment of any Company Employee, including the
amendment or termination of any employee benefit or compensation plan, program
or arrangement (including any Company Benefit Plan), after the Effective
Time; or (C) constitute an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any other
plan or arrangement covering Company Employees.

SECTION 7.12 _Indemnification Following the Effective Time_.

employment agreement or Company Benefit Plan, from the Effective Time through
the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former director and
officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures
(the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys\' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
Action arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is
or was a director, officer, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Joint Ventures (including with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (x) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from the Buyer
or the Surviving Corporation within five Business Days of receipt by the
Company of a request therefor ( _provided_ that any person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
MIBCA, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person
is not entitled to indemnification), (y) neither the Buyer nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any proceeding or threatened Action (and in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all Liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (z) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter. 

(b) The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers than are presently set forth in the Companys current articles of
incorporation and bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals.



 

53 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to cause to be maintained for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time a policy (or a "tail" policy) of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insureds than the terms currently
provided to directors and officers of the Company with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance coverage that exceeds
300% of the current annual premium for such coverage paid by the Company,
which premium is set forth in _Section 7.12 of the Company Disclosure

(d) In the event that, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, reasonable provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation will assume the obligations of the
Company, including those set forth in this Section 7.12.

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.12 (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The Buyer shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 7.12.

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 7.12 shall
continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.

take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions

that Buyer and Merger Sub may, after consultation with the Company, replace or
amend the Debt Financing Commitments to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the

Financing Commitments and upon other terms and conditions no less favorable
than in the Debt Financing Commitments in an aggregate amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby promptly following the
occurrence of such event. The Buyer shall deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide Buyer and Merger Sub with any portion
of the Debt Financing.

violation or breach of, or a default under, in any material respect any
Material Contract. The Buyer shall, promptly upon written request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs to the

liabilities or losses arose out of the arrangement of the Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided
by Company or its Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures).

accordance with this Agreement as promptly as practicable. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation

Representative of any such party); _provided_ , that the provisions of
Sections 7.9(c), 9.2 and 9.3 and Article X will survive any termination
hereof. Nothing herein shall relieve the parties of any Liability for any
breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement that occur prior to the termination of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the payment by the Company of a Termination
Fee or a Company Breach Fee, in accordance with Section 9.2(a), will (together
with any Buyer Termination Expenses previously paid to the Buyer in
accordance with Section  



 

61  9.2(a)) be considered liquidated damages for any breach by the Company of
this Agreement and in the event of such payment the Company will not have any
other Liability for any breach by it of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (other than
Liability for fraud) and (ii) the payment by the Buyer of a Buyer Breach Fee
or a Financing Termination Fee, in each case in accordance with Section
9.2(a), will be considered liquidated damages for any breach by the Buyer or
Merger Sub of this Agreement and in the event of such payment neither the
Buyer nor Merger Sub will have any other Liability for any breach by it of
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement (other than Liability for fraud).

(b) The parties hereto agree (i) in the case of the Buyer, irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and that accordingly, the Buyer shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and (ii) in the case of
the Company, irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and that accordingly, the Company
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) whether or not the Company is
entitled to injunctions or specific performance pursuant to the provisions of
the preceding sentence or otherwise, in no event shall the Buyer be subject to
(nor shall the Company or its Affiliates seek to recover) monetary damages
other than the Buyer Breach Fee or the Financing Termination Fee, as
applicable, for all Liability arising from or in connection with breaches by
the Buyer of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement or arising from any claim or cause of action that
the Company may have and (y) whether or not the Buyer is entitled to
injunctions or specific performance pursuant to the provisions of the
preceding sentence or otherwise, in no event shall the Company be subject to
(nor shall the Buyer or its Affiliates seek to recover) monetary damages
other than the Termination Fee (and, if applicable, the Buyer Termination
Expenses) or the Company Breach Fee, as applicable, for all Liability arising
from or in connection with breaches by the Company of its representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or arising
from any claim or cause of action that the Buyer may have. For the further
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall (i) preclude any party
from seeking a Buyer Breach Fee, a Financing Termination Fee, a Company Breach
Fee, a Termination Fee or Buyer Termination Expenses, as applicable to such
party, as permitted herein while also seeking injunctions or specific
performance pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 9.3(b) or (ii) act
to preclude any party from recovering any such fee as a result of such party
electing to pursue such alternative remedies or any courts determination not
to award any such equitable relief. In no event shall (x) the Company or any
of its Affiliates seek to recover monetary damages from any of the Buyers
Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members, directors, officers or agents or
(y) the Buyer, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates seek to recover
monetary damages from any of the Companys Affiliates, stockholders, partners,
members, directors, officers or agents.

SECTION 9.4 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
by action taken or authorized, in the case of the Buyer, by its board of
directors, in the case of Merger Sub, by its board of directors, and in the
case of the Company, by the Company Board, at  



 

62  any time before or after the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, but, after
receipt of such approval, no amendment will be made which by Law or
in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further
approval by the Company Stockholders without such further approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of the Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company.

SECTION 9.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after the Special Meeting, the Buyer (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub)
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the covenants,
obligations or other acts of the Company or (b) waive any inaccuracy of any
representations or warranties or compliance with any of the agreements,
covenants or conditions of the Company or with any conditions to its own
obligations. Any agreement on the part of the Buyer (on behalf of itself and
Merger Sub) to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if such waiver
is set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Buyer by its
duly authorized officer. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the Special Meeting, the Company may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of the
Buyer or Merger Sub or (b) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or
warranties or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions
of the Buyer or Merger Sub, or with any conditions to its own obligations.
Any agreement on the part of the Company to any such extension or waiver will
be valid only if such waiver is set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of the Company by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such
right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances will not be
deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances, and each
such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.
