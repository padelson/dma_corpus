made, or no Election Form has been properly returned, in accordance with the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, (ii) an Election Form specifies that the
holder thereof makes no election with respect to such share or (iii) an
election to receive Cash Election Consideration or Stock Election
Consideration has been properly revoked in accordance with the terms of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.2_. Shares of Company Common Stock that are Escrow Trust
Shares at the Election Deadline shall be treated as No Election Shares.

(c) _New Holders_. Parent shall make available one (1) or more Election Forms
as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become
holders or beneficial owners of shares of Company Common Stock during the
Election Period, and the Company shall provide the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform its duties as specified
herein.

(d)  _Revocations; Exchange Agent_. Any election shall have been properly
made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly
completed Election Form during the Election Period. After a Cash Election or a
Stock Election has been properly made with respect to any shares of Company
Common Stock, any subsequent transfer of such shares of Company Common Stock
shall automatically revoke such election. Any Election Form may be revoked or
changed by the person submitting it, by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In the event an Election Form is
revoked during the Election Period, the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall 

 



27

    

 be deemed to be No Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent
election is properly made during the Election Period. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of the Parties or the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any
defect in an Election Form.

 

Section 3.3 _Payment for Securities; Exchange of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of
record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (or consent
thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal
of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _DGCL 262_ " and any such shares
meeting the requirement of this sentence, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead
at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of
such amounts as are payable in accordance with DGCL 262 (it being understood
and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
other than the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares to
the extent afforded by DGCL 262); _provided_ , that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under DGCL 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting
Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any
demands received by the Company for fair value of any shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to DGCL 262 and of any withdrawals of such demands,
and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall have the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by _Article V_ ), the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred,
then the Merger Consideration, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be delivered in the Merger, the Cash Election Consideration, the Stock
Election Consideration, the No Election Consideration, the Aggregate Company
Share Amount, the Aggregate Parent Share Amount and the Exchange Ratio, as the
case may be, shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ , that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to
take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

 



28

    

(c) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in the Merger upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
with respect to Book-Entry Shares or otherwise, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. Each holder of Company Common Stock or a Company
Equity Award converted pursuant to the Merger that would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all shares evidenced by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive from Parent, in lieu thereof and upon
surrender thereof, a cash payment (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the
Parent Common Stock VWAP (rounded down to the nearest penny).

Section 3.4 _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), the identity and the terms of appointment of which to be
reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger
Consideration and shall enter into an agreement relating to the Exchange
Agents responsibilities with respect thereto, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company.

 

Section 3.5 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Deposit of Company Merger Consideration_. Substantially concurrently with
the Effective Time, but in no event later than the wire cut off deadline on
the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited
(including by the Surviving Corporation), with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence
of Parent Common Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates
representing such Parent Common Stock, at Parents election) representing the
full number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the
stock portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the cash portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration, in
each case, payable in the Merger to all holders of Company Common Stock and
(iii) to the extent applicable, cash in an amount sufficient for payment in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_. As
needed from time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited (including by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation), with the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock to which holders of Company Common Stock
become entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5(d)_. Such shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any
dividends or other distributions with respect thereto, are referred to
collectively in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_ into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon, (A) with respect to shares evidenced
by Certificates, delivery of the Certificates

 



29

    

 (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and (B) with respect to Book-Entry
Shares, proper delivery of an "agents message" regarding the book-entry
transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), as applicable, to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree upon prior to the Effective Time)
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.5(d)_.

 

(c) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, together with a
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive, within two (2) Business Days following
the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Exchange Agents
receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share, in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the
shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5(d)_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock may
be paid or issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.5(c)_, each Certificate
and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with
any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5(d)_.

 

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. Whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared or made after the date of this Agreement
with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time, such declaration shall include a dividend or other
distribution in respect of all such shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions, if any, with
a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered share of Company Common Stock
to be converted into cash and shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_ until such holder shall surrender such share in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.5(d)_. After the surrender in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 3.5(d)_ of a share of Company Common
Stock to be converted into cash and shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
(in addition to the Merger Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to
this _Article III_ ) any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the
share of Parent Common Stock represented by such share of Company Common
Stock.

 



30

    

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The shares of Parent Common Stock delivered
and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (i) all
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights
as stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender
of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.5(c)_ (together with any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 3.5(d)_), without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article III_.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_
, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Article III_ , and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund, and such
investments shall only be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the
United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America or in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized
under the Laws of a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by SandP Global Ratings or Moodys Investors Service, Inc.,
respectively. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to
making the payments pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. Any
interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, upon demand.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws), as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for
Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_ without any interest
thereon.

 



31

    

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Parties or the Exchange Agent shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund or the Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration or the
cash to be paid in accordance with this _Article III_ that remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of
immediately prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of a Certificate, a
Book-Entry Share or a Company Equity Award pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under any applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted
and withheld shall be paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity and
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the Certificate, Book-Entry Share or Company Equity Award in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
mutilated or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed
and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person
of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 3.5(g)_, Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such
lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and
any dividends and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

(k) _Deferred Shares of Company Common Stock_. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Merger Consideration applicable to any shares of Company
Common Stock, the delivery of which has been previously deferred pursuant to a
valid deferral election under a non-qualified deferred compensation plan of
the Company, shall be delivered at the time or time(s) set forth in the
applicable deferral election, in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.

 



32

    

Section 3.6 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _C_ _ompany RSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company
RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the holder
thereof, be assumed by Parent as of the Effective Time and converted into a
restricted unit award of Parent (each, an " _Assumed Company Restricted Unit
Award_ "). Each Assumed Company Restricted Unit Award shall cover that number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the applicable Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio,
with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock. Except as otherwise provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.6(a)_,
each Assumed Company Restricted Unit Award shall continue to have, and shall
be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the original terms and conditions applicable to a Company RSU
granted under a Company Stock Plan do not expressly provide for the treatment
of such Company RSU upon a termination of employment that occurs following a
"change in control" or "corporate transaction" (as such terms are used in an
applicable Company Stock Plan, or the award agreement, as applicable), then,
upon such Company RSU becoming an Assumed Company Restricted Unit Award, the
terms set forth on Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to apply to such Assumed Company Restricted Unit Award; _provided_ ,
that all other terms and conditions applicable to such Company RSU shall
continue to apply unaffected.

(b) _C_ _ompany PSUs_.

 

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to each outstanding
Company PSU that, pursuant to its terms, requires accelerated vesting as of
the Effective Time, the restrictions and vesting conditions applicable to such
Company PSU shall lapse in accordance with the terms thereof and each such
Company PSU shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock underlying such
Company PSU, the Cash Election Consideration. The Cash
Election Consideration, less applicable Tax withholdings, shall be paid or
provided to the holder of such Company PSU as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date.

(ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to each outstanding
Company PSU that, pursuant to its terms, does not require accelerated vesting
as of the Effective Time (and which is therefore not converted into the right
to receive the Cash Election Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.6(b)(i)_), such Company PSU shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
further action on the part of the holder thereof, be treated as follows:

(A) Company PSUs or portions thereof that are eligible to vest in respect of
(I) performance conditions that are not based on share or market price and
(II) performance achieved during the year in which the Closing occurs, shall
vest based on the level of actual performance achievement of the applicable
performance criteria through the end of the month immediately preceding the
month in which the Closing occurs, as proportionately extrapolated through the
remainder of the applicable performance period (as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Company

 



33

    

 Board of Directors, in its reasonable discretion and in consultation with
Parent), and shall be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock underlying the
vested portion of such Company PSU, the Cash Election Consideration. The Cash
Election Consideration, less applicable Tax withholdings, shall be paid or
provided to the holder of such Company PSU as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date. Any such Company PSUs which do not become vested
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)(ii)(A)_ shall be cancelled as of the
Effective Time without consideration.

(B) Company PSUs or portions thereof that are eligible to vest in respect of
(I) performance conditions that are not based on stock or market price and
(II) a performance period that has not yet commenced as of the Effective Time,
shall vest based on deemed achievement at the "target" level performance, and
shall be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive, with
respect to each share of Company Common Stock underlying the vested portion of
such Company PSU, the Cash Election Consideration. The Cash
Election Consideration, less applicable Tax withholdings, shall be paid or
provided to the holder of such Company PSU as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the Closing Date. Any such Company PSUs which do not become vested
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)(ii)(B)_ shall be cancelled as of the
Effective Time without consideration

 

(C) Company PSUs that are eligible to vest in respect of performance
conditions that are based on stock or market price (each, a " _Company
Market-PSU_") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the
part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent as of the Effective Time and
converted into a performance-based restricted unit award of Parent (each, an
" _Assumed Company Performance Unit Award_ "). Each Assumed Company
Performance Unit Award shall cover that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of (I) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock underlying the applicable Company Market-PSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by (II) the Exchange Ratio, with the
result rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock. The stock-based or market-based performance conditions applicable to
each Assumed Company Performance Unit Award shall be equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the applicable stock-based or market-based
performance target(s) of the applicable Company Market-PSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio (or, if the applicable stock-
based or market-based performance target(s) are determined as a percentage or
multiple of an initial value, then instead such initial value shall instead be
divided by the Exchange Ratio). Except as otherwise provided in this 
_Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)(ii)(C)_, each Assumed Company Performance Unit Award
shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions
as applied to the corresponding Company PSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the original terms and
conditions applicable to a Company Market-PSU granted under a Company Stock
Plan do not expressly provide for the treatment of such Company Market-PSU
upon a termination of employment that occurs following a "change in control"
or "corporate transaction" (as such terms are used in an applicable 

 



34

    

 Company Stock Plan, or the award agreement, as applicable), then, upon such
Company Market-PSU becoming an Assumed Company Performance Unit Award,
the terms set forth on Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to apply to such Assumed Company Performance Unit Award; _provided_
, that all other terms and conditions applicable to such Company Market-PSU
shall continue to apply unaffected.

(c) _Company Options_.

 

(i) Subject to Section 3.6(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option or portion
thereof that (A) is then outstanding and unexercised, (B) is vested and
exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to its
terms and (C) has a per share exercise price less than the Cash Election
Consideration, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled as of the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive the Company Option Consideration. The
Company Option Consideration, less applicable Tax withholdings, shall be paid
or provided to the holder of such Company Option as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days following the Closing Date. The " _Company Option
Consideration_ " with respect to any Company Option shall be equal to the
product of (I) the Company Option Net Shares of such Company Option,
multiplied by (II) the Cash Election Consideration. The " _Company Option Net
Shares_ " of any Company Option shall be equal to the quotient of (x) the
product of (1) the excess of (X) the Cash Election Consideration over (Y) the
applicable per share exercise price of such Company Option, multiplied by (2)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the vested
portion of such Company Option, divided by (y) the Per Share Amount.

 

(ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to each outstanding
and unexercised Company Option or portion thereof that is not cancelled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6(c)(i)_, such Company Option or portion thereof
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the
holder thereof, be assumed by Parent as of the Effective Time and converted
into a stock option representing the right to acquire shares of Parent Common
Stock (each, an " _Assumed Company Option_ "). The number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to each Assumed Company Option shall be equal to (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company
Option or the portion thereof which was not cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.6(c)(i)_, multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock. The per
share exercise price of each Assumed Company Option shall be equal to (I) the
per share exercise price of such Company Option, divided by (II) the Exchange
Ratio, with the result rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Except as
otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.6(c)(ii)_, each Assumed Company
Option shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding Company Option or portion thereof
which was not cancelled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.6(c)(i)_, immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the original
terms and conditions applicable to a Company Option granted under a Company
Stock Plan do not expressly provide for the treatment of such Company Option
upon a termination of employment that occurs 

 



35

    

 following a "change in control" or "corporate transaction" (as such terms
are used in an applicable Company Stock Plan, or the award agreement, as
applicable), then, upon such Company Option becoming an Assumed Company
Option, the terms set forth on Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to apply to such Assumed Company Option; _provided_ , that all
other terms and conditions applicable to such Company Option shall continue
to apply unaffected.

(d) _Company Actions_. Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _
3.6_, in the event the Company determines, in its discretion, to treat any
Company PSUs in a manner that varies from the treatment outlined in _Section_
__ _ 3.6(b)_, the Company may take any such actions necessary or appropriate
to effect such determination. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary (including adopting resolutions of the Company
Board of Directors or any committee thereof) to effectuate the treatment of
the Company Equity Awards contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.6_. Parent
shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery with respect
to the settlement of Assumed Company Restricted Unit Awards, Assumed Company
Performance Unit Awards and Assumed Company Options pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 3.6_. Parent shall file with the SEC, as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time, a post-effective amendment to the Form S-4 or a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) relating to such
shares of Parent Common Stock. Any conversion of Company Equity Awards
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ shall be done in a manner consistent
with Section 409 of the Code.

described therein; _provided_ , that, except for disclosure to the Company and

Debt Financing Commitment (including any debt securities and credit facilities
issued in lieu of any portion of such debt financing as contemplated in
the Debt Financing Commitment) is referred to herein as the " _Debt
Financing_."

 



52

    

(b) The Debt Financing Commitment is, as of the date hereof, in full force and
effect. The Debt Financing Commitment is the legal, valid, binding and

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court

reasonably be expected to (A) constitute or result in a breach or default on
the part of Parent (or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party to the
Debt Financing Commitment) under the Debt Financing Commitment, (B) constitute
or result in a failure to satisfy a condition or other contingency set forth
in the Debt Financing Commitment or (C) otherwise result in any portion of

date hereof, Parent has not received any notice or other communication from
any party to the Debt Financing Commitment with respect to (i) any actual or
potential breach or default on the part of Parent or any other party to the
Debt Financing Commitment or (ii) any intention of such party to terminate the
Debt Financing Commitment or to not provide all or any portion of the Debt
Financing. As of the date hereof, Parent and Merger Sub (i) have no reason to
believe (both before and after giving effect to any "flex" provisions
contained in the Debt Financing Commitment) that, assuming the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
they will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis each term and condition
relating to the closing or funding of the Debt Financing and (ii) know of no
fact, occurrence, circumstance or condition that, assuming the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
would reasonably be expected to (A) cause the Debt Financing Commitment to
fail to be satisfied, to terminate, to be withdrawn, modified, repudiated or
rescinded or to be or become ineffective or (B) otherwise cause the full
amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing contemplated to be available
under the Debt Financing Commitment to not be available to Parent and Merger
Sub on a timely basis (and in any event no later than at the Closing). The
aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, together
with available cash on hand of Parent and the Company, will be sufficient for
Parent and Merger Sub to (i) consummate the Merger and any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including (A) the payment of the Cash
Election Amount and (B) any funds to be provided by Parent to the Company to
enable the Company to fund payments (if any) required to be made in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 3.6_, (ii) repay any indebtedness required to be repaid,
redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged
in connection with the Merger and (iii) pay all fees, costs and expenses
(including any premiums or penalties) in connection therewith on the Closing
Date. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set
forth in the Debt Financing Commitment. There are no side letters or other
Contracts (except for customary engagement letters which do not contain
provisions that impose any additional conditions or other contingencies to the
funding of the Debt Financing, and true, correct and complete copies of which
have been provided to the 

 



53

    

 Company), whether written or oral, related to the funding of the full amount
of the Debt Financing other than as expressly set forth in or expressly
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (i)
awarding any agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any
financial advisory role on an exclusive basis in connection with the Merger
or (ii) expressly prohibiting any bank, investment bank or other potential
provider of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing
or financial advisory services to any Person in connection with a
transaction relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All
commitment fees or other fees or deposits required to be paid under the Debt
Financing Commitment on or prior to the date of this Agreement have been paid

aggregate Merger Consideration, repayment or refinancing of any indebtedness
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if any,
and payment of all related fees and expenses, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, will be Solvent. For the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 4.24_, the
term " _Solvent_ ," when used with respect to any Person, means that, as
of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value"
(determined on a going concern basis) of the assets of such Person will, as of
such date, exceed the value of all "liabilities of such Person,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal Laws
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, (b) such Person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" mean that such Person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or lines of credit, or a combination
thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may result from requests
for access.

or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of the Company) or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (in the case of Parent) or (iii) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, without the prior written
consent of Parent or the Company, as applicable (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ shall not restrict any Representatives of the Company
or Parent, as applicable, from receiving incoming correspondence in
the ordinary course (such as answering phone calls) from any landlord,
tenant, customer, supplier, distributor or other material business relation of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of the Company) or the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of Parent), so long as (A) such
contact was not, directly or indirectly, solicited or encouraged by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Representatives or Affiliates, as
applicable, (B) the Company or Parent, as applicable, informs Parent or the
Company, as applicable, of such correspondence as soon as reasonably
practicable, (C) such Representative immediately informs such landlord,
tenant, customer, supplier, distributor or other material business relation

to (1) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of the Company) or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of Parent), (2) the business
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of the Company) or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of Parent) or (3) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (D) such Representative does
not represent that it is authorized to, nor does it negotiate or enter into,
any Contract (in principle or otherwise) on behalf of Parent or any of its

Subsidiaries (in the case of Parent).

 

(c) The Parties hereby agree that all information provided to them or their
respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the

termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth therein.

 

(d) No investigation by any Party of the business and affairs of the other
Parties, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ or otherwise, will affect or
be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to any Partys obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall, and each shall cause
its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and employees to,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries
other Representatives and Affiliates to, (i) immediately cease any
solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any
Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and promptly
instruct (to the extent it has contractual authority to do so and has not
already done so prior to the date of this Agreement) or otherwise request,
any Person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement
within the twelve (12)-month period prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with any

 



66

    

 actual or potential Takeover Proposal to return or destroy all such
confidential information or documents previously furnished in connection
therewith or material incorporating any such information in the possession of
such Person or its Representatives (and to confirm in writing the return or
destruction of all such information) and (ii) from and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the Termination Date, not,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or

a Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
substantive discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other
Person any non-public information in connection with or for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, a Takeover Proposal (other than (x) solely in
response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring Person to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ or (y) upon receipt of a  _bona fide_ , unsolicited
written Takeover Proposal from any Person that did not result from a breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, solely to the extent necessary to ascertain
facts or clarify terms with respect to a Takeover Proposal for the Company
Board of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors, as applicable, to be able
to have sufficient information to make the determination described in
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_) or (C) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose
to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar document,
agreement, commitment or agreement in principle providing for a Takeover
Proposal.

 

(b) Except as expressly provided by this Agreement, none of the Parties shall
take any action to exempt any Person from the Takeover Laws or the Takeover
Provisions or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply. Except (x) as
necessary to take any actions that the Company, Parent or any third party
would otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_
(and in such case only in accordance with the terms hereof) or (y) if the
Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors, as applicable,
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that any such action or forbearance would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (i) neither the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, nor Parent and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall release
any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant
permission under any (A) standstill provision in any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, is a party or (B) confidentiality provision in any Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, is a party (excluding any waiver under a
confidentiality provision that does not, and would not reasonably be likely
to, facilitate or encourage a Takeover Proposal) and (ii) each of the Company
and Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the
confidentiality and standstill provisions of any such Contract; _provided_ ,
that, for the avoidance of doubt, any automatic release from the standstill
provisions of any such Contract in accordance with its terms shall
not constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this  _Section_ __
_ 5.3_, (x) if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and (i)
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, or (ii)
prior to the obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent, directly or
indirectly receives a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Takeover Proposal made
after the date of this Agreement from any Person and such Party, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives are not in material breach of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and (y) if the Company Board of Directors or the
Parent Board of Directors, as applicable,

 



67

    

 determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, and failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then such Party and its Representatives may, directly or
indirectly, (A) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
information (including non-public information) with respect to such Party and
its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties, assets,
employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of such Party and its
Subsidiaries, to the Person that has made such Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives and potential sources of funding; _ provided_, that such
Party shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such Person
provide to the other Parties any non-public information concerning such Party
or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such Person
or its Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously
provided or made available to the other Parties and (B) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Takeover Proposal (including as a part thereof, making counterproposals) and
its Representatives and potential sources of financing regarding such Takeover
Proposal. " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any customary
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable
in the aggregate to the Company than those applicable to Parent or to Parent
than those applicable to the Company, as applicable, that are contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ , that such confidentiality agreement
shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with any of the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_.

 

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly (and in no event later than
forty-eight (48) hours after receipt) notify, orally and in writing, one
another of any Takeover Proposal received by such Party or any of its
Representatives, which notice shall include the identity of the Person making
the Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof (including
copies of any written proposal relating thereto provided to such Party or any
of its Representatives) and indicate whether such Party has furnished non-
public information to, or entered into discussions or negotiations with, such
third party. Each of the Company and Parent shall keep one another reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis as to the status of (including changes
to any material terms of, and any other material developments with respect
to) such Takeover Proposal. Each of the Company and Parent agrees that it and
its Subsidiaries will not enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent
to the date of this Agreement that prohibits such Party from providing any
information to Parent in accordance with this _ Section 5.3_.

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this _ Section 5.3(e)_, the Company
Board of Directors and the Parent Board of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail
to include the Company Recommendation (in the case of the Company Board of
Directors) or the Parent Recommendation (in the case of the Parent Board of
Directors) in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (B) change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation (in the case of the Company Board of Directors) or to
the Company, the Parent Recommendation (in the case of the Parent Board of
Directors), (C) make or publicly propose to make any recommendation in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation
against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors, as

 



68

    

 applicable, of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
(it being understood that the Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board
of Directors, as applicable, may refrain from taking a position with respect
to such a tender offer or exchange offer until the close of business as of the
tenth (10th) Business Day after the commencement of such tender offer or
exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such
action being considered an Adverse Recommendation Change so long as the
Company reaffirms the Company Recommendation or Parent reaffirms the Parent
Recommendation during such period), (D) other than with respect to the period
of up to ten (10) Business Days applicable to formal tender or exchange offers
that are the subject of the preceding clause (C), fail to recommend against a
Takeover Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation or the Parent
Recommendation, as applicable, in either case within ten (10) Business Days
after a request by Parent or the Company, as applicable, to do so; _provided_
, _however_ , that (1) such ten (10) Business Day period shall be extended for
an additional ten (10) Business Days following any material modification to
any Takeover Proposal occurring after the receipt of Parents or the
Companys written request, as applicable, and (2) each of Parent and the
Company shall be entitled to make such a written request for reaffirmation
only once for each Takeover Proposal and once for each material amendment to
such Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred
to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or (ii) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of the Company
Board of Directors) or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of the
Parent Board of Directors) to enter into any letter of intent, agreement,
commitment or agreement in principle providing for any Takeover Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance
with _ Section 5.3(c)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval or the
Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained, (x) the Company Board of Directors or
the Parent Board of Directors, as applicable, may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if (1) the Company or Parent, as applicable, is not
in material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and (2) after receiving a
_bona fide_ unsolicited written Takeover Proposal, the Company Board of
Directors or the Parent Board of Directors, as applicable, has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that (i) such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (ii) in light of such Takeover Proposal, the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board
of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement in order to
enter into a binding written agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1(k)_; _provided_ , that the Company Board
of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors, as applicable, has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors or the Parent
Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, prior to making any Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminating this Agreement as described in clauses (x) and (y) of this
sentence, (A) the Company has given Parent, or Parent has given the Company,
as applicable, at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material terms
and conditions of any such Superior Proposal) and the Company has
contemporaneously provided to Parent, or Parent has contemporaneously provided
to the Company, as applicable, a copy of the Superior Proposal and a copy of
any written proposed transaction documents with the person making
such Superior Proposal, (B) the

 



69

    

 Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent, or Parent has negotiated
in good faith with the Company, during such notice period to enable Parent or
the Company, as applicable, to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, (C) following the end of such notice period,
the Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors, as
applicable, shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent (in the case of the Company Board
of Directors) or the Company (in the case of the Parent Board of Directors),
and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, were to be given effect, and (D) in the event of any
change to any material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall have
delivered to Parent, or Parent shall have delivered to the Company, as
applicable, an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A)
above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso
shall commence (except that the four (4) Business Day period notice period
referred to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the
longer of (i) two (2) Business Days and (ii) the period remaining under the
notice period under clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the
delivery of such additional notice under this clause (D)) during which time
the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this _
Section 5.3(e)_ anew with respect to such additional notice, including clauses
(A) through (D) above of this proviso.

 

(f) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ and shall
not be subject to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_), nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board of Directors from making an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event, or
the Parent Board of Directors from making an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a Parent Intervening Event, if the Company Board of Directors or
the Parent Board of Directors, as applicable, has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Company Board of Directors or the Parent
Board of Directors, as applicable, to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board
of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to making such
Adverse Recommendation Change, (i) the Company has given Parent, or Parent
has given the Company, as applicable, at least four (4) Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify the reasons therefor, (ii) the Company or Parent, as applicable, has
negotiated, and directed its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with
Parent or the Company, as applicable, during such notice period after giving
any such notice to enable Parent or the Company, as applicable, to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would not permit the
Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors, as applicable, to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.3(f)_ and (iii) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board
of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors, as applicable, shall have
considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent or the Company, as applicable, and shall have
determined, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to such Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event, as
applicable, would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company
Board of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 



70

    

(g) Nothing contained in this _ Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board of Directors, on the one hand, or Parent or the Parent
Board of Directors, on the other hand, from taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company or Parent, as applicable, a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any "stop, look and listen" communication or any other similar
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company or Parent, as applicable,
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in the determination in
good faith of the Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board of
Directors, as applicable, after consultation with outside counsel, the
failure so to disclose would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or obligations under applicable federal
securities Law of the Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board of
Directors, as applicable.

the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and
the Company will cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
its respective stockholders, as applicable, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act
(the date upon which such mailing occurs, the " _Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus Mailing Date_ "). Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent, to keep the
Form S-4 effective through the Closing in order to permit the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and
the Share Issuance. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken
under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Share
Issuance and the reservation of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger,
and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the
holders of Company Common Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest therein,
as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any such action.
No filing or mailing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, without the other Partys prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other
Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments
shall be considered by the other Party in good faith); _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent or the Company, as applicable, in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change, a Takeover Proposal or a Superior Proposal may amend or
supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment, and in such
event, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to information
relating to the other Party or its business, financial

 



71

    

 condition or results of operations. A " _Qualifying Amendment_ " means an
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including by incorporation by reference) to the
extent it contains (a) an Adverse Recommendation Change, (b) a statement of
the reason of the Company Board of Directors or the Parent Board of Directors,
as applicable, for making such Adverse Recommendation Change, (c) a factually
accurate statement by the Company or Parent that describes the Companys or
Parents receipt of a Takeover Proposal or Superior Proposal, the terms of
such proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, and
(d) additional information reasonably related to the foregoing.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify one another upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and shall, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, provide one another with copies of all correspondence between
it and its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and
all written comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4 and advise one another of any oral comments with respect to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comment from the SEC with respect to
the Form S-4. Parent or the Company, as applicable, will advise one another
promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when the Form
S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been
filed, the threat or issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information, and will promptly provide one another with copies
of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission.
If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent
or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors,
is discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that either such document would not include a
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein (in light of the circumstances under which
they were made), not misleading, the Party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other Parties and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company. Each of Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate upon the
other Partys request in amending or supplementing the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment made in compliance
with this Agreement.

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus by the SEC, the Company shall take all action
necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Companys Governing
Documents to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
(the " _Company Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ ") and not postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting except (i) to the extent required by applicable
Law or to solicit additional proxies or (ii) votes in favor of adoption of
this Agreement if sufficient votes to

 



72

    

 constitute the Company Stockholder Approval have not been obtained;
_provided_ , that, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Company
Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is
more than twenty (20) days after the date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable Law). The Company will, except in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change, through the Company Board of Directors,
recommend that its stockholders adopt this Agreement and will use reasonable
best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement and to take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of Nasdaq
or applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

 

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus by the SEC, Parent shall take all action necessary
in accordance with applicable Laws and Parents Governing Documents to duly
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose
of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval (the " _Parent Stockholders_ __
_Meeting_ ") and not postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting
except to the extent required by applicable Law or to solicit additional
proxies and votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement if sufficient votes
to constitute the Parent Stockholder Approval have not been obtained;
_provided_ , that, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Parent
Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is
more than twenty (20) days after the date for which the Parent Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable Law). Parent will, except in the case of an Adverse
Recommendation Change, through the Parent Board of Directors, recommend that
its stockholders approve the Share Issuance, the Delaware Conversion and the

to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of
Nasdaq or applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders
Meeting on the same date and at the same time.

waiver would or would reasonably be expected to (i) delay or prevent the
Closing, (ii) reduce the aggregate net proceeds of the Debt Financing from
that contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment as in effect on the date
hereof, (iii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend

rights against other parties under the Debt Financing Commitment or any
Financing Agreements with respect thereto; it being understood that
notwithstanding the foregoing Parent may amend the Debt Financing Commitment
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities that had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date
of this Agreement and otherwise amend, modify or restate the Debt Financing
Commitment in any manner not inconsistent with this sentence. Upon any
amendment of the Debt Financing Commitment in accordance with this _Section_

references herein to "Debt Financing Commitment" shall include such documents
as amended in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.16(d)_ and (ii)
references to "Debt Financing" or "Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment as amended in compliance

two (2) Business Days) and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources (the "

Financing Commitment and in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger on
the Closing Date no later than the Closing Date and (C) on terms not
materially less beneficial to Parent or Merger Sub. True, complete and correct
copies of any new financing commitment letter (including any associated
engagement letter and related fee letter (which fee letter may be redacted to
remove fee amounts and other economic terms, none of which affect the
availability or the net amount of such Debt Financing)) shall be promptly
provided to the Company. In the event any Alternate Financing is obtained in

"Debt Financing Commitment" or "Debt Financing" shall include the debt
financing contemplated by such Alternate Financing.

 



89

    

(f) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its
efforts to obtain the Financing and provide the Company with copies of any
Financing Agreements related thereto upon the execution thereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (i) give the Company
prompt written notice of (A) any default, breach or threatened breach in
writing by any party of any of the Debt Financing Commitment or Financing
Agreements related thereto or related to any other Financing or Related
Financing of which any of Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives or
Affiliates become aware or any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or
rescission or threatened withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission in
writing thereof, (B) any dispute or disagreement between or among the parties
to any Debt Financing Commitment or Financing Agreements or (C) if at any
time, for any reason, Parent believes that it will not be able to obtain all
or a portion of the Debt Financing or any other Financing at or prior to the
Closing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (or, in the case of any other
Financing, the Financing Agreements with respect thereto) and (ii) otherwise
keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing (or any Alternate Financing). Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to keep the Company reasonably informed of the status of
efforts of the Real Estate Financing Sources to obtain the Related Financing
and shall give the Company prompt written notice if it becomes aware of any
reason that the Real Estate Financing Sources will not be able to obtain all
or a portion of the Related Financing.

 

(g) In the event any Financing is funded in advance of the Closing Date,
Parent, or its applicable Subsidiary, shall keep and maintain at all times
prior to the Closing Date the proceeds of such Financing available for the
purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such
proceeds shall be maintained as unrestricted cash or cash equivalents, free
and clear of all Liens; _provided_ , that if the terms of any such Financing
requires the proceeds of such Financing to be held in escrow or in a secured
proceeds account (or similar arrangement) pending the consummation of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, then such proceeds shall be
held in escrow or in a secured proceeds account, in each case, pursuant to a
customary agreement, with applicable Liens in favor of the escrow agent,
trustee or other applicable agent for the benefit of the applicable lenders
or security holders with customary release provisions for such funds in
accordance with the Debt Financing Commitment (as in effect on the date
hereof) (or, in the case of any other Financing, the Financing Agreements
with respect thereto).

(h) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that obtaining any
Debt Financing, any other Financing or any Related Financing is not a
condition to the Closing.

Section 5.17 _Post-Closing Directors_. Parent shall take all such
action within its power as may be necessary or appropriate such that

condition to filing or issuing a certificate to the effect that the Delaware
Conversion is effective, Parent shall execute any necessary document

Delaware Conversion will become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Conversion has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and
Parent in writing and specified in the Certificate of Conversion in accordance

of the Delaware Conversion, the shares of the Delaware corporation into which
the shares of Parent Common Stock will be converted shall be listed on Nasdaq.

condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or _Section_
__ _ 6.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by
such Partys material breach of this Agreement.

Section 7.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company

(except as otherwise provided below):

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been

94

    

 Antitrust Law or Gaming Law) or _Section_ __ _ 6.1(e)_ has not been

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if any Law shall have been adopted,
promulgated or issued by any Governmental Entity (including any Gaming
Authority) that prohibits, permanently restrains, permanently enjoins or

which is addressed in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_), which breach or failure to
perform (i) if it occurred or was continuing to occur on the Closing Date,
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_
or _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ and (ii) by its nature, cannot be cured prior to
the End Date or, if such breach or failure is capable of being cured by the
End Date, Parent has not cured such breach or failure within thirty (30) days
after receiving written notice from the Company describing such breach or
failure in reasonable detail ( _provided_ , that the Company is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein that would result in a failure of a condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_);

 

(g) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) if it occurred or was
continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_
and (ii) by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such
breach or failure is capable of being cured by the End Date, the Company has
not cured such breach or failure within thirty (30) days after receiving
written notice from Parent describing such breach or failure in reasonable
detail ( _provided_ , that Parent is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein that
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_
or _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_);

(h) by the Company, if Parent shall have been in willful and material breach
of its obligations with respect to Antitrust Laws under _Section_ __ _
5.5(b)_, which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured or, if such breach is
capable of being cured, has not been cured within thirty (30) days after
receiving written notice from the Company describing such breach in detail (
_provided_ , that the Company is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein that
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_
or _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_);

(i) by Parent, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in the
event of an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to the Company;

(j) by the Company, prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval,
in the event of an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to Parent; or

 

(k) by the Company, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.1(k)_ unless in advance of or concurrently with such termination the

Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, notice thereof shall be given to
the other Parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to which such

Agreement, and the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.13(c)_, _Section_ __ _
5.16(b)_, this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and liability
arising out of or the result of, intentional fraud or any willful and material
breach of any covenant or agreement or willful and material breach of
any representation or warranty in this Agreement occurring prior to

failure to consummate the Closing in a circumstance in which all of the
conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ have
been satisfied (or waived), other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied (or waived) contemporaneously with the Closing, shall
constitute a willful and material breach of this Agreement), in which case
the aggrieved Party shall not be limited to expense payment or any fee payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and shall be entitled to all rights and
remedies available at Law or in equity.

then Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee by wire

termination, or, in the case of clause (ii), at or prior to such termination,
or, in the case of clause (iii), upon the earlier of the consummation of

(i) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_
in connection with any Law relating to Antitrust Laws or Gaming Laws,
including the Gaming Approvals;

 



97

    

(ii) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ and
at the time of such termination, any of the conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 6.1(b)_ (if the applicable Law relates to Antitrust Laws or Gaming Laws,
including the Gaming Approvals) or _Section_ __ _ 6.1(e)_ shall not have
been satisfied and the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_ and _Section_ __

Parent) in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days after such
termination.

 

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_, the Parent shall pay Company an amount not to
exceed $50,000,000 in respect of the Companys reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement (the "
_Company Expense Payment_ " and, together with the Parent Expense Payment, the
" _Expense Payments_ ") by wire transfer (to an account designated in writing
by the Company) in immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days
after such termination.

(e) " _Company_ _Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to $418,407,185.
" _Parent Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to $154,945,692. "
_Reverse Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to $836,814,370.

 

(f) Each of the Parties hereby agrees that any and all remedies set forth in
this Agreement, including payment of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent
Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable (in each case, a
" _Termination Fee Payment_ "), and the Expense Payments, shall be deemed
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or
at Law or in equity upon such Party, and the exercise by any Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a Termination Fee Payment that becomes due and payable
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a),_ _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ shall be compensation and liquidated damages for the
loss suffered by the Company or Parent, as applicable, as a result of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of
determining damages under the circumstances and none of the Parties shall have
any other liability to one another after the payment of such Termination Fee
Payment, except in the case of intentional fraud or a willful and material
breach of this Agreement or as specifically set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.3(f)_ with respect to a Reverse Termination Fee becomes payable in
circumstances constituting a Regulatory Breach

 



98

    

 Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
a Termination Fee Payment shall become due and payable in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(a),_  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_,
as applicable, from and after such termination and payment of such Termination
Fee Payment pursuant to and in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a),_
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_, as applicable, the paying
Party shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in connection
with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as
provided under _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a),_ _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ or _Section_
__ _ 7.3(c)_, as applicable, except in the case of intentional fraud or a
willful and material breach of this Agreement. Each of the Parties
acknowledges that any Termination Fee Payment that becomes due and payable in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a),_  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ is not intended to be a penalty, but rather
constitutes liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such
Termination Fee Payment is due and payable and that do not involve intentional
fraud or a willful and material breach of this Agreement, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall any
Party be entitled to more than one payment of the Termination Fee Payment in
connection with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which the
Termination Fee Payment is payable, and if the Termination Fee Payment is
payable at such time as the receiving Party has already received payment or
concurrently receives payment from the paying Party in respect of the Parent
Expense Payment or the Company Expense Payment, as applicable, the amount of
such Parent Expense Payment or the Company Expense Payment actually received
by Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall be deducted from the
Termination Fee Payment due and payable to such Party; _provided_ , _however_
, that in the event Parent is required to pay both the Parent Termination Fee
and the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, Parent
shall be required to pay to the Company only the Reverse Termination Fee.
Solely for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, " _Takeover Proposal_ "
shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section_ __ _ 1.1_, except that
all references to 20% shall be changed to 50%. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, if the Reverse Termination Fee becomes
payable in circumstances constituting a Regulatory Breach Termination, the
Company may elect in its sole discretion to either (i) demand payment of such
Reverse Termination Fee in writing, in which case such Reverse Termination
Fee will be paid by Parent to the Company by wire transfer to the account
designated by the Company in immediately available funds within two (2)
Business Days of such written demand or (ii) directly or indirectly, pursue
an award of monetary damages or any other remedy available to it at law or in
equity; _provided_ , that, for purposes of clarity and for the avoidance of
doubt, the Companys exercise of any right to seek specific performance or
other equitable relief pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not
affect the Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.1_ or collect the Reverse Termination Fee (it being understood that
in no event shall the Company be entitled both to specific performance to
cause Parent to consummate the Merger and payment of the Reverse Termination
Fee); _provided_ , _further_ , that, under no circumstances will the Company
be entitled to receive both an award of monetary damages in connection with a
Regulatory Breach Termination and payment of all or any portion of the Reverse
Termination Fee.

 



99

    

(g) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if a Party fails to pay in a timely manner
any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, then such Party shall
reimburse the other Party for all costs and expenses (including disbursements
and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such
overdue amount, including in connection with any related Actions commenced
and pay interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such
amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate
set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made.

the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form
or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic

Section 8.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) that
may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Action, controversy or
dispute of any kind or nature, whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, involving a Financing Source or Related Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Financing Commitment,
the Related Financing, the Related Financing Commitment or the transactions

applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 

Section 8.5 _Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur (for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy) in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed (including
failing to take such actions as are required of each of them hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), or were
threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any
other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary damages, each of
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and all such
rights and remedies at Law or in equity shall be cumulative, except as may
be limited by _Section_ __ _ 7.3_. Each of the Parties agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity. The Parties further agree that no Party
shall be required to obtain, secure, furnish or post any bond, security or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ and each Party waives any
objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require
the obtaining, securing, furnishing or posting of any such bond, security or
similar instrument. In addition, each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that
any Action with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by any other Party or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action for itself and in
respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
Action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion,
as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent 

 



101

    

 permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (i) the Action in such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or
(iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or
by such courts. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties hereby consents to the
service of process in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.7_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Parties
agrees on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives that it, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
will not bring or support any Action, whether in Law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources, Related Financing Sources
and their respective current, former or future directors, officers, general or
limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, controlling
persons, Affiliates, employees or advisors, in each case, in their respective
capacities as such, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any

of the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or
waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of the Company.

_Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the second sentence of _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, _Section_
__ _ 8.5(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.6_, this sentence of _Section_ __ _ 8.11_

provision may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a
manner materially adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of any such adversely affected Financing Source.

this Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the

Sources_. Each of the Parties agrees that their respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms of

 _provided_ , __ that the Financing Sources and Related Financing Sources
shall be express third-party beneficiaries of  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the
second sentence of _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_, _Section_ __
_ 8.6_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ and this _Section_ __ _
8.13_, each such Section shall expressly inure to the benefit of the Financing
Sources and the Related Financing Sources and each of them shall be entitled
to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein but subject to the proviso at the

employees or advisors of any such Financing Source or Related Financing Source
in its capacity as such) in connection with this Agreement, the Financing, the
Debt Financing Commitment, the Related Financing, the Related Financing
Commitment or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law
or equity, contract, tort or otherwise, nor shall any Financing Source or
Related Financing Source in its capacity as such (or any current, former or
future directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees or advisors of
any Financing Source or Related Financing Source in its capacity as such) have
any obligations or liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with this Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Financing Commitment,
the Related Financing, the Related Financing Commitment or the transactions

limiting the obligations of the Financing Sources to Parent (and its
successors, assigns and Affiliates) and/or the other rights of the parties to
