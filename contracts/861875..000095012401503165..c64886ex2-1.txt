conveyance, assignment assumption and    -4-     9  confirmation, and

carry out the intent of this Agreement.   1.4 Certain Consents. To the
extent that Sellers\' rights under any agreement, contract, commitment,
lease, permit, or other Asset to be assigned to Purchaser hereunder may not
be assigned without the consent of another person which has not been obtained
prior to the Closing Date, and which is important to the ownership, use or
disposition by Purchaser of an Asset, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a
breach thereof or be unlawful, and for a period of ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date, Sellers, at their expense, shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any such required consent(s) as promptly as
possible. If any such consent shall not be obtained or if any attempted
assignment would be ineffective or would impair Purchaser\'s rights under the
Asset in question so that Purchaser would not in effect acquire the benefit
of all such rights, Sellers shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law and
at Sellers\' expense, act after the Closing as Purchaser\'s agent in order to
obtain for the Purchaser the benefits thereunder, and Sellers
shall cooperate, to the maximum extent permitted by law, with Purchaser in
any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide such benefits to
Purchaser, including any sublease or subcontract or similar arrangement.  
1.5 Purchase Price; Payment of Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price
for the sale, transfer and conveyance of the Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities (the "Purchase Price") shall be subject to adjustment
as set forth in Section 1.6 below and paid to ClearVision at the Closing,
as follows:   (a) Purchaser shall deliver to ClearVision an aggregate
amount in cash (the "Closing Cash Payment") equal to Four Million Eight
Hundred Eighty-Two Thousand Two Hundred Forty Two Dollars ($4,882,242), which
Closing Cash Payment shall be utilized by ClearVision on the Closing Date to
discharge in full the severance obligations, notes and other indebtedness set
forth on Schedule 1.5 attached hereto.   (b) Purchaser shall deliver to
ClearVision the number of shares of the Purchaser\'s common stock, $.01 par
value (the "Purchaser Common Stock"), equal to (i) Two Million Two Hundred
One Thousand Two Hundred (2,201,200) shares, less (ii) the number of shares
equal to $225,000 divided by the Average Market Price (as defined below) (the
"Closing Stock Payment"). Such Closing Stock Payment being subject to
additional adjustment as set forth in Section 1.6 and Section 12.1 hereof. On
the Closing Date, an aggregate of 750,000 shares of the Purchaser Common
Stock included in the Closing Stock Payment shall be deposited by the
Purchaser in an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") governed by an Escrow
Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (the "Escrow
Agreement"). The Escrow Account shall be available to satisfy any amounts
owing to Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.6 and/or Section 12.1. The Closing
Stock Payment shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in
Article 13 below.     -5-     10     1.6 Purchase Price
Adjustments.   (a) Net Assets Adjustment. As set forth in this Section
1.6(a), the Closing Stock Payment shall be adjusted to reflect the
difference, if any, between the Actual Net Assets (as defined below) of
Sellers on the Closing Date and the Agreed Net Assets (as defined below) of
Sellers on the Closing Date. As used herein, the term "Actual Net Assets"
shall mean the value as of the close of business on the Closing Date of (a)
the book value of the Assets, less (b) the book value of the Assumed
Liabilities (as hereinafter defined) and all outstanding indebtedness to
FINOVA Capital Corporation, each as determined in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied
("GAAP"). As used herein, the term "Agreed Net Assets" shall mean
$(1,715,651) and shall be calculated in a manner consistent with Schedule
1.6(a).   (i) At Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser a  preliminary
balance sheet of Sellers as of the Closing Date reflecting  Sellers\'
estimate of the Assets and Assumed Liabilities of Sellers as  of the Closing
Date (the "Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet").  Sellers also shall
deliver to Purchaser with the Preliminary Closing  Date Balance Sheet a
schedule showing the calculation of estimated  Actual Net Assets as of the
Closing Date (the "Preliminary Closing  Schedule"). The Closing Date Balance
Sheet (as defined below), the  Preliminary Closing Schedule, the Closing
Schedule (as defined below)  and the determination of Actual Net Assets shall
be prepared in  accordance with GAAP.   (ii) Within sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date,  Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers an adjusted
closing balance sheet  reflecting Purchaser\'s calculation of the Assets and
Assumed  Liabilities of Sellers as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date 
Balance Sheet") and a schedule showing the calculation of Actual Net  Assets
based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet (the "Closing  Schedule"). Within
such 60-day period, Purchaser may, at its sole  election, cause the Closing
Date Balance Sheet to be reviewed or  audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
(the "Purchaser\'s Accountants").  Purchaser shall bear the entire cost of
the fees and expenses of the  Purchaser\'s Accountants, if any. Within thirty
(30) days following  receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Closing Schedule,  Sellers shall review the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
deliver to  Purchaser their proposed revisions, if any, thereto. Purchaser
shall  make available to Sellers copies of any documents reasonably
requested  by Sellers to substantiate and confirm the accuracy of the
calculations  presented in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and Closing
Schedule. If  within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Closing
Schedule,  Sellers have not given notice of their objections to the Closing 
Schedule (which notice must contain a statement of the basis of such 
objection), then the Actual Net Assets reflected in the Closing  Schedule
shall be deemed accepted and agreed to by the parties. If any  party gives
such notice of objection, the parties shall attempt to  resolve by
negotiation any dispute created by such objection. If such  dispute has not
been resolved by negotiation within fifteen (15) days  after receipt of such
notice of objection, then notwithstanding any  other provision hereof, the
items in dispute shall be submitted to the  St. Louis, Missouri office of
KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is unwilling or  unavailable to    -6-   11 
so serve, such other nationally recognized accounting firm as shall be 
mutually agreed upon by the parties (the "Accounting Firm") for  resolution
within thirty (30) days. The determination of the Accounting  Firm, as set
forth in a notice delivered to Purchaser and Sellers by  the Accounting Firm,
shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and  shall not be subject to
review or challenge of any kind. The fees and  expenses of the Accounting
Firm, if any, shall be borne equally by  Purchaser and Sellers.   (iii) On
the third business day following the final  determination of the Actual Net
Assets as set forth below, if Actual  Net Assets is less than Agreed Net
Assets as set forth in the final  Closing Schedule (a "Shortfall"), then
Purchaser shall be entitled to  receive from the Escrow Account a number of
shares of Purchaser Common  Stock equal to the amount of such Shortfall
divided by the average of  the last transaction prices as reported by the
Nasdaq National Market  and published in The Wall Street Journal of Purchaser
Common Stock for  the fifteen consecutive trading days on which trades were
reported  ending on the third business day prior to the Closing Date (the 
"Average Market Price").   (b) Physician Retention Adjustment. As set forth
in this Section 1.6(b), in the event that on the Measurement Date (as defined
below) the Aggregate Procedure Volume (as defined below) of all Retained
Physicians (as defined below) is less than eighty percent (80%) of Total
Procedure Volume (as defined below), Purchaser shall be entitled to receive
from the Escrow Account a total of 500,000 shares of Purchaser Common
Stock.   (i) For purposes of this Section 1.6(b):   (A) the term
"Aggregate Procedure Volume" shall  mean the aggregate number of completed
refractive laser eye  surgical procedures performed by Retained Physicians
during  the period from January 1, 2001 to May 31, 2001 as set forth 
opposite each Retained Physician\'s name on Schedule 1.6(b)  attached hereto,
excluding any re-treatments, enhancements or  procedures subject to discounts
granted by the Company to the  Retained Physician (other than discounts
provided pursuant to  Seller\'s marketing programs, including corporate
charter  programs, national provider contracts and other corporate  provider
arrangements);   (B) the term "Measurement Date" shall mean the  date which
is ninety (90) days following the Closing Date;   (C) the term "Retained
Physician" shall mean  any physician, physician practice group or other
healthcare  provider listed on Schedule 1.6(b) hereto which as of the 
Measurement Date (x) has a laser service provider agreement  with the
Purchaser in full force and effect, (y) has not  delivered to Purchaser or
Sellers any notice of termination of  such agreement or otherwise expressed
to Sellers or Purchaser  an intent to terminate such agreement, and (z) is
actively  performing paid laser procedures under its agreement with 
Purchaser    -7-  12      consistent with its past volume history
during the period from  February 1, 2001 to May 31, 2001 as reflected on
Schedule  1.6(b), excluding, however effect of decreases in volume 
resulting directly from inactivity of such Physician due to  vacation or
illness during the period from June 1, 2001 to the  Measurement Date; and  
(D) the term "Total Procedure Volume" shall  mean the total number of
completed refractive laser eye  surgical procedures performed by all
physicians, physician  practice groups or other healthcare providers having
an  agreement with Sellers during the period from January 1, 2001  to May
31, 2001 as set forth on Schedule 1.6(b), excluding any  re-treatments,
enhancements or procedures subject to discounts  granted by the Company to
the Retained Physician (other than  discounts provided pursuant to Seller\'s
marketing programs,  including corporate charter programs, national
provider  controls and other corporate provider arrangements).   (ii)
Sellers hereby represent and warrant to  Purchaser that the name and
procedure volume of each  physician, physician practice group or other
healthcare  provider performing procedures under an agreement with Sellers 
for the period January 1, 2001 to May 31, 2001 as set forth on  Schedule
1.6(b) hereto is true, accurate and complete in all  material respects, and
that no such physician, physician  practice group or other healthcare
provider listed thereon has  provided Sellers with any notice of termination
or intent to  terminate its agreement with Sellers and continues on the
date  hereof to actively perform paid laser procedures under its  agreement
with Sellers consistent with past volume history,  excluding, however, the
effect of decreases in volume  resulting directly from inactivity of such
Physician due to  vacation or illness during the period from June 1, 2001 to
the  Measurement Date.   For a period of 90 days after the Closing,
Purchaser agrees: (y) to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
preserve the goodwill of each Retained Physician; and (z) to maintain the
general levels of service at each of the locations utilized by Sellers
immediately prior to the Closing Date.   1.7 Fractional Shares.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates
nor scrip for fractional shares of the Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued
in the Closing Stock Payment. If ClearVision would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock, upon request to Purchaser,
ClearVision shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an
amount determined by multiplying the fractional interest to which ClearVision
would otherwise have been entitled by the Average Market Price.   1.8 Anti-
Dilution Adjustments. If, during any period used to determine the Average
Market Price of Purchaser Common Stock, the Purchaser shall declare a stock
dividend, or make a distribution in stock upon, or subdivide, split up,
reclassify or combine the Purchaser Common Stock or declare a dividend or
make a distribution on the Purchaser Common Stock in any    -8- 
13   security convertible into Purchaser Common Stock (each, an
"Extraordinary Corporate Transaction"), appropriate and proportional
adjustment or adjustments will be made to the Average Market Price for the
trading days prior to the effective date of the Extraordinary Corporate
Transaction to equitably reflect such Extraordinary Corporate Transaction. If
the Extraordinary Corporate Transaction is effected after the period used to
determine the Average Market Price of Purchaser Common Stock but prior to the
Closing Date, appropriate and proportional adjustment or adjustments will be
made to the Closing Stock Payment such that such payment shall result in the
issuance of that number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock as if the
Extraordinary Corporate Transaction had a record or payment date therefor
immediately after the Closing Date.   1.9 Purchase Price Allocation.
Purchaser and Sellers agree to allocate the Purchase Price together with any
Assumed Liabilities (as defined in Section 2.1) between and among the Assets
in the manner specified by Purchaser and Sellers and set forth in Schedule
1.9 hereto. Purchaser and Sellers shall timely complete and file a Form 8594
Asset Acquisition Statement of Allocation consistent with the allocation set
forth in Schedule 1.9, shall provide a copy of such form to Purchaser or
Sellers, as the case may be, and shall file a copy of such form with its
federal income tax return for the period that includes the Closing Date.
Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall take a position in any Return (as defined
in Section 3.3(a)), or examination or other administrative or judicial
proceeding relating to any Return, that is inconsistent with such allocation
as may be agreed to by Purchaser and Sellers.   1.10 Distribution of Escrow
Account. Within 15 days following the later of (i) the Measurement Date or
(ii) the final determination of Actual Net Assets pursuant to Section 1.6(a)
above, Purchaser shall direct the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement to

Sellers. Subject to the provisions of this Article 12, by execution of this
Agreement, Sellers agree to jointly and severally indemnify Purchaser and its
affiliated companies, their respective successors and permitted assigns and
their respective officers, directors, shareholders, advisors and employees
and defend, indemnify and hold them harmless against and in respect of,
arising from or in connection with:   (i) any of the Excluded Assets or any
of the  Excluded Liabilities;   (ii) any and all demands, claims, actions
or causes  of action, assessments, penalties, loss, liability, cost, expense
or  damage (including judgments and settlement payments) incurred by them 
incident to, arising in connection with or resulting from any 
misrepresentation, breach, nonperformance or inaccuracy of any 
representation, warranty, or covenant by Sellers made or contained in  this
Agreement or in any Exhibit, Schedule, certificate or other  document
executed and delivered to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement  or the
transactions contemplated herein; and   (iii) any and all costs, expenses
and all other  actual damages incurred by Purchaser in remedying any

in  enforcing its right of indemnification hereunder, including, by way of 
illustration and not limitation, all legal and accounting fees, other 
professional expenses and all filing fees, and collection costs  incident
thereto and all such fees, costs and expenses incurred in  defending claims
which, if successfully prosecuted, would have resulted  in Damages (as
defined herein).   (b) By Purchaser. Subject to the provisions of
this Article 12, by execution of this Agreement, Purchaser agrees to
indemnify each of the Sellers and their affiliated companies, their
respective successors and assigns and their respective officers, directors,
shareholders, advisors and employees, and defend, indemnify and hold them
harmless against and in respect of, arising from or in connection
with:     -37-  42   (i) any and all demands, claims, actions or
causes  of action, assessments, penalties, loss, liability, cost, expense
or  damage (including judgments and settlement payments) incurred by them 
incident to, arising in connection with or resulting from any 
misrepresentation, breach, nonperformance or inaccuracy of any 
representation, warranty, or covenant by Purchaser made or contained in  this
Agreement or in any Exhibit, Schedule, certificate or document  executed and
delivered to Sellers by Purchaser under or pursuant to  this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein;   (ii) any and all demands, claims,
actions or causes  of action, assessments, penalties, loss, liability, cost,
expense or  damage (including judgments and settlement payments) incurred by
them  incident to, arising in connection with or resulting from all other 
liabilities and obligations directly or indirectly arising from or  relating
to (1) acts or failures to act by the Purchaser subsequent to  the Closing,
(2) Purchaser\'s possession, use and operation of the  Assets after Closing,
and (3) all of the Assumed Liabilities; and   (iii) any and all costs,
expenses and all other  actual damages incurred by Sellers in claiming,
contesting or remedying  any breach, misrepresentation, nonperformance or
inaccuracy described  above, or in enforcing their right of indemnification
hereunder,  including, by way of illustration and not limitation, all legal
and  accounting fees, other professional expenses and all filing fees, and 
collection costs incident thereto and all such fees, costs and expenses 
incurred in defending claims which, if successfully prosecuted would  have
resulted in Damages (as defined herein).   (c) Damages. Any and all of the
items set forth in Sections 12.1(a) and 12.1(b) for which a party is entitled
to be indemnified hereunder are called "Damages."   12.2 Notice of, and
Procedures for, Collecting Indemnification.   (a) Initial Claim Notice. When
a party becomes aware of a situation which may result in Damages for which it
would be entitled to be indemnified hereunder, such party (the "Indemnitee")
shall submit a written notice (the "Initial Claim Notice") to the other party
from which indemnification may be forthcoming pursuant to Section 12.1 (the
"Indemnitor") to such effect with reasonable promptness after it first
becomes aware of such matter and shall furnish the Indemnitor with such
information as it has available demonstrating its right or possible right to
receive indemnity. If the potential claim is predicated on, or later results
in, the filing by a third party of any action at law or in equity (a "Third
Party Claim"), the Indemnitee shall provide the Indemnitor with a
supplemental Initial Claim Notice promptly and in any event not later than
ten (10) days prior to the date on which a responsive pleading must be filed,
and shall also furnish a copy of such claim (if made in writing) and of all
documents received from the third party in support of such claim. In
addition, each Initial Claim Notice shall name, when known, the person or
persons making the assertions which are the basis for such claim. Failure by
the Indemnitee to deliver an Initial Claim Notice or an update thereof in a
timely manner shall    -38-  43  not relieve the Indemnitor of any of
its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent that actual
monetary prejudice to the Indemnitor can be demonstrated.   (b) Rights of
Indemnitor. If, prior to the expiration of 30 days from the mailing of an
Initial Claim Notice (the "Claim Answer Period"), the Indemnitor shall
request in writing that such claim not be paid, the same shall not be paid,
and the Indemnitor shall settle, compromise or litigate in good faith such
claim, and employ attorneys of its choice to do so; provided, however, that
Indemnitee shall not be required to refrain from paying any claim which has
matured by court judgment or decree, unless appeal is taken therefrom and
proper appeal bond posted by the Indemnitor, nor shall it be required
to refrain from paying any claim where such action would result in the
foreclosure of a lien upon any of its assets or a default in a lease or other
contract except a lease or other contract which is the subject of the
dispute. Indemnitee shall cooperate fully to make available to the Indemnitor
and its attorneys, representatives and agents, all pertinent information
under its control. Indemnitee shall have the right to elect to settle or
compromise all other contested claims with respect to which the Indemnitor
has not, within the Claim Answer Period, acknowledged in writing (i)
liability therefor, and (ii) its election to assume full responsibility for
the settlement, compromise, litigation and payment of such claim.   (c)
Final Claims Statement. At such time as Damages for which the Indemnitor is
liable hereunder are incurred by Indemnitee by actual payment thereof or by
entry of a final judgment, Indemnitee shall forward a final claims statement
to the Indemnitor and the Escrow Agent (as defined below) setting forth the
amount of such Damages in reasonable detail on an itemized basis (the "Final
Claims Settlement"). Indemnitee shall supplement the Final Claims Statement
with such supporting proof of loss (e.g. vouchers, canceled checks,
accounting summaries, judgments, settlement agreement, etc.) as
the Indemnitor may reasonably request in writing within 30 days after receipt
of a Final Claims Statement. All amounts reflected on Final Claims Statements
shall be paid promptly by Indemnitor to Indemnitee in accordance with Section
12(d), (e) and (f) below, and Indemnitee shall have the right to immediate
payment of proceeds from insurance policies paid to Indemnitor in connection
with the claim for which the indemnification right arose.   (d) Escrow for
Indemnification. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Escrowed Funds in
the Escrow Account shall be used to indemnify Purchaser for Damages incurred,
relating to or arising out of, the circumstances set forth in Section
12.1(a).   (e) Controlling Document. To the extent the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement conflict with the provisions of this Agreement,
the provisions of the Escrow Agreement shall supersede this Agreement and be
the controlling document.   (f) Survival of Indemnification; Sole and
Exclusive Remedy. Any other provision hereof to the contrary notwithstanding,
the parties agree that the representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement and in any certificates delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive for a period equal to the Applicable Limitations
Date. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Applicable Limitations Date"
shall mean the later of (i) the final    -39-  44  determination of
Actual Net Assets as set forth in Section 1.6 hereof, or (ii) ninety days
after the Closing Date, in each case regardless of any investigation made by
either party prior to the date hereof or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser
and Sellers shall only be entitled to indemnification under this Article 12
for breaches of representations and warranties if a written notice describing
the claim for which indemnification is sought is signed by the President or
any Vice President of Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be, and is
submitted to Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be, not later than
the Applicable Limitations Date for such claim. Any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Article 12 for breaches of representations
and warranties not made prior to the expiration of the Applicable Limitations
Date shall be extinguished, and all representations and warranties with
respect to which no claim is made prior to the expiration of the Applicable
Limitations Date shall expire and be of no further force and effect;
provided, however, that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to (A) any
claim by either party for actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation, (B)
any claim by Sellers with respect to Purchaser\'s obligations concerning any
Asset or Assumed Liability, and (C) any claim by Purchaser with respect to
Sellers\' obligations concerning any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability.
The provisions of this Article 12 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein, except in the case of (w) a claim by either party for actual fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, (x) any claim by Sellers with respect to
Purchaser\'s obligations concerning any Asset or Assumed Liability, (y) any
claim by Purchaser with respect to Sellers\' obligations concerning any
Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability and (z) in the case of any violation of
state or federal securities laws in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (g) Dollar Limitations. The parties hereto
agree that no violations or breaches under any one or more of the
representations and warranties of Sellers or Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement shall support a claim for Damages unless and until Damages
attributable to all violations and breaches exceed on a cumulative and
aggregate basis the sum of $50,000, it being understood that such amount is a
"threshold" and not a "deductible." Purchaser\'s rights to indemnification
under this Article 12 shall be limited to the Escrow Account. Sellers\'
rights to indemnification under the Article 12 shall be limited to the amount
of $1,750,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in
this Section 12(g) shall not apply to (i) any claim by either party for
actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation, (ii) any claim by Sellers with
respect to Purchaser\'s obligations concerning any Asset or Assumed
Liability, and (iii) any claim by Purchaser with respect to
Sellers\' obligations concerning any Excluded Asset or Excluded
Liability.   ARTICLE 13   INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS; TRANSFER
RESTRICTIONS   13.1 Investment Representations.   (a) This Agreement is
made with the Sellers in reliance upon Sellers representations to the
Purchaser, which by its execution hereof ClearVision hereby confirms,
that    -40-  45 the Purchaser Common Stock issued as the Closing Stock
Payment (all such securities are referred to as the "Securities" for purposes
of this Article 13) to be received by ClearVision will be acquired for
investment for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with a
view to the sale or distribution of any part thereof, and that it has no
present intention of selling, granting participation in, or otherwise
distributing the same. By executing this Agreement, ClearVision further
represents that it does not have any contract, undertaking, agreement or
arrangement with any person to sell, transfer, or grant participations to
such person or to any third person, with respect to any of the
Securities.   (b) Each of the Sellers understands that the Securities are
not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933
Act") on the ground that the sale provided for in this Agreement and the
issuance of Securities hereunder should be exempt from registration under the
1933 Act and that the Purchaser\'s reliance on such exemption is predicated
on ClearVision\'s representations set forth herein. ClearVision realizes that
the basis for the exemption may not be present if, notwithstanding such
representations, ClearVision has in mind merely acquiring the Securities for
a fixed or determinable period in the future, or for a market rise or for
sale if the market does not rise. ClearVision confirms that it has no such
intention.   (c) ClearVision represents that it is an "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Rule 501 under the 1933 Act and that it is experienced
in evaluating and investing in companies such as the Purchaser, is able to
fend for itself in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of his investment and has the
ability to bear the economic risks of its investment. ClearVision further
represents that it has had access, during the course of the transaction and
prior to its purchase of the Securities, to the information filed by the
Purchaser with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that it has had,
during the course of the transaction and prior to its execution hereof, the
opportunity to ask questions of, and to receive answers from, the Purchaser
concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of the Securities and to
obtain additional information necessary to verify the accuracy of any
information furnished to ClearVision or to which it has had access.
ClearVision is aware that a significant portion of any future revenues of the
Purchaser may be adversely affected by market and regulatory forces.
ClearVision acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to obtain additional
information as desired in order to evaluate the merits and risks inherent in
purchasing and holding the Securities.   (d) ClearVision understands that
the Securities may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the 1933 Act or an exemption therefrom, and that in the
absence of an effective registration statement covering the Securities or an
available exemption from registration under the 1933 Act, the Securities must
be held indefinitely. In particular, ClearVision is aware that the Securities
may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act unless
all of the conditions of that Rule are met. ClearVision represents that, in
the absence of an effective registration statement covering the Securities,
it will sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Securities only in a
manner consistent with their representations set forth herein and then only
in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.1(e) hereof.    -41- 
46   (e) ClearVision agrees that in no event will it make a transfer or
disposition of any of the Securities (other than pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the 1933 Act), unless and until (i) ClearVision
shall have notified the Purchaser of the proposed disposition and shall have
furnished the Purchaser with a statement of the circumstances surrounding the
disposition and assurance that the proposed disposition is in compliance with
all applicable laws and (ii) it shall have furnished to the Purchaser an
opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser, to the effect
that such transfer may be made without registration under the 1933 Act and
otherwise complied with Section 13.2. Any transferee receiving the Securities
other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or sale pursuant
to Rule 144 shall confirm the investment representations and warranties and
restrictions set forth in this Article 13 in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser as a condition to effecting any
transfer.   13.2 Restrictions on Transfer of Purchaser Common Stock. For
a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary
date of the Closing Date (the "Restriction Period"), the Sellers may not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Stock Payment Shares (as defined
below) without the prior written consent of the Purchaser. Other than the
restrictions on sale, transfer or disposition imposed by this Article 13,
during the Restriction Period the Sellers shall be entitled to the same
rights as the other shareholders of the Purchaser with respect to the Stock
Payment Shares, including voting rights and the right to receive dividends or
other distributions, if any, as and when declared by the Purchaser\'s Board
of Directors. Upon the expiration of the Restriction Period, all restrictions
on the sale, transfer or disposition of the Stock Payment Shares shall
terminate and the Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers, within five
business days following the lapse of such restrictions, the certificates
representing any Stock Payment Shares, without any legend referencing
restrictions imposed pursuant to this Section 13.2. For purposes of this
Section 13.2, "Stock Payment Shares" shall mean the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock issued to the Sellers on the Closing Date in satisfaction of the
Closing Stock Payment and any additional shares of Purchaser Common Stock
received by the Sellers in respect of such shares in the event that following
the Closing Date the Purchaser shall declare a stock dividend, or make a
distribution in stock upon, or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine the
Purchaser Common Stock or declare a dividend or make a distribution on the
Purchaser Common Stock in any security convertible into Purchaser Common
Stock.   13.3 Legends; Stop Transfer.   (a) All certificates for the
Securities may bear the following or a substantially similar legend:   THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE  SOLD, TRANSFERRED,
HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE ASSIGNED EXCEPT  PURSUANT TO (i) A REGISTRATION
STATEMENT RELATING TO THE  SECURITIES WHICH IS EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF  1933, (ii) RULE 144 UNDER SUCH ACT, OR (iii) AN OPINION OF    
-42-  47   COUNSEL OR OTHER EVIDENCE SATISFACTORY TO LASER VISION 
CENTERS, INC., THAT ANOTHER EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION  REQUIREMENTS OF
SUCH ACT IS AVAILABLE.   (b) The certificates for the Securities may also
bear any legend required by any applicable state securities or other law.  
(c) In addition, the Purchaser shall make a notation regarding the
restrictions on transfer of the Securities in its records and the Securities
shall be transferred on the books of the Purchaser only if transferred or
sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act
covering such shares or pursuant to and in compliance with Section 13.1(e)
and Section 13.2 hereof.   ARTICLE 14   MISCELLANEOUS   14.1 Notices.

any other application thereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby; provided, however, that to the extent permitted by applicable law,
any invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision may be considered for the
purpose of determining the intent of the parties in connection with the other
provisions of this Agreement.   14.6 Waivers. The parties may, by written
agreement, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered    -44-  49  pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance
with, or modify, any of the covenants or conditions contained in this
Agreement, and (d) waive or modify performance of any of the obligations of
any of the parties hereto; provided, that no such waiver or failure to insist
upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall operate as a waiver of, or an estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
insistence upon such strict compliance other than with respect to the matter
so waived or modified.   14.7 Publicity. Any public announcements concerning
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be jointly planned and
simultaneously released by Purchaser and Sellers, and none of them shall act
in this regard without the prior written approval of the others, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.   14.8 Headings. The headings

bear their own expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions herein contemplated, including, but not limited to, legal and
accounting fees and expenses.   14.11 Confidentiality; Public Announcements.
Prior to the Closing Date (and if the Closing does not occur, for a period of
five years from the date hereof), Purchaser and Sellers (and their respective
employees, agents, auditors, attorneys and other authorized representatives)
shall not, without prior written consent of the party divulging information
under this Agreement (the "Divulging Party"), communicate or divulge to any
person or entity or use for their benefit any information (other than
information otherwise available or which becomes public other than as a
result of their action) concerning the Divulging Party\'s financial condition
or business, or concerning any marketing information, equipment, methods,
research, clients, contracts, suppliers, customers or other data of or
relating to the Divulging Party or other confidential     -46- 
51  matters possessed, owned or used by such Divulging Party that may
be communicated to, acquired by or learned by them. All correspondence,
records, files, tax returns, financial statements and other data relating to
such Divulging Party which shall come into the possession of Purchaser or
Sellers, as the case may be, shall remain the sole property of such Divulging
Party pending the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. If
the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated for any reason, then
Purchaser and Sellers, as the case may be, shall return all of the foregoing
material to the Divulging Party, together with any and all copies thereof
made. The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement between Purchaser and
Sellers remains in full force and effect, notwithstanding the execution and
deliver of this Agreement.   14.12 Entire Agreement; Law Governing. Except
as set forth in Section 14.11 hereof, all prior negotiations and agreements
between the parties hereto are superseded by this Agreement, and there are no
representations, warranties, understandings or agreements other than those
expressly set forth herein or in an Exhibit or Schedule delivered pursuant
hereto, except as modified in writing concurrently herewith or subsequent
hereto. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted
according to the internal laws of the State of Missouri, determined without
reference to conflicts of law principles. Except as to matters subject to
arbitration (other than enforcement of awards therefrom or enforcement of any
party\'s agreement to arbitrate) as described in Section 14.15 below, to the
extent permitted by law, each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submits to the jurisdiction of any Missouri state court or United States
federal court, in either case sitting in Missouri, over any suit, action or
other proceeding brought by any party arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all
claims with respect to any such suit, action or other proceeding shall be
heard and determined in such courts.   14.13 No Third-Party Rights. This
Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed to create any rights in
any persons other than Purchaser and Sellers, and no person shall assert any
rights as third-party beneficiary hereunder.   14.14 Termination.   (a)
This Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing as  follows:   (i) at the
election of Purchaser if any one or more  of the conditions set forth in
Article 9 to their obligation to proceed  with the Closing has not be
fulfilled on or before the Closing Date;   (ii) at the election of Sellers
if any one or more  of the conditions set forth in Article 10 to their
obligation to  proceed with Closing has not been fulfilled on or before the
Closing  Date;   (iii) at the election of Purchaser or Sellers if any 
legal proceeding is commenced or threatened by any governmental or 
regulatory authority or other person (other than Purchaser, Sellers or  any
affiliate of the Purchaser or Sellers) directed against     -47-  52 
the consummation of the Closing and either Purchaser or Sellers, as the  case
may be, reasonably and in good faith deem it impractical or  inadvisable to
proceed in view of such legal proceeding or threat  thereof, taking into
account the potential expense and delay likely to  be involved;   (iv) at
any time on or prior to the Closing Date,  by mutual written consent of
Purchaser and Sellers; or   (v) at the election of Purchaser or Sellers,
if  Closing has not occurred on or prior to August 31, 2001.  If this
Agreement so terminates, it shall become null and void and have no further
force and effect, except as provided in Section 14.11 which shall survive
termination, and except that nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto
for a breach by such party of the terms of this Agreement.   14.15 Disputes;
Arbitration Procedure.   (a) Each of the parties hereto agrees that they
will attempt to settle any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of
this Agreement through good faith negotiations in the spirit of mutual
cooperation between senior business executives with authority to resolve the
controversy.   (b) Any dispute, claim or controversy that cannot
be resolved by the parties through good faith negotiations within thirty (30)
days of the notification to the other party of the commencement of the
dispute resolution procedures of this Section 14.15 will then, upon the
written request of any party hereto, be resolved by binding arbitration
conducted in accordance with the then effective Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association by a sole arbitrator. Such arbitrator
shall be mutually agreeable to the parties. If the parties cannot mutually
agree upon the selection of an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be selected
in accordance with the rules of the then effective Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association. To the extent not governed by
such rules, such arbitrator shall be directed by the parties to set a
schedule for determination of such dispute, claim or controversy that is
reasonable under the circumstances. Such arbitrator shall be directed by the
parties to determine the dispute in accordance with this Agreement and the
substantive rules of law (but not the rules of procedure or evidence) that
would be applied by a federal court required to apply the internal law (and
not the law of conflicts) of the State of Missouri. The arbitration will be
conducted in the English language in Kansas City, Missouri. Judgment upon the
award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having
jurisdiction.   (c) Nothing contained in this Section 14.15 shall
prevent any party hereto from resorting to judicial process if injunctive or
other equitable relief from a court is necessary to prevent injury to such
party or its affiliates. The use of arbitration procedures will not be
construed under the doctrine of laches, waiver or estoppel to affect
adversely the rights of any party hereto to assert any claim or
defense.    -48-   53   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have
caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives
on the day and year first above written.   PURCHASER:   LASER VISION
