At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the

(a)

  |  

Each share of preferred stock, par value $50.00 per share, of the Company ("
_Company Preferred Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Preferred Shares_ ") (excluding Dissenter Shares) shall
be deemed to be automatically converted, along with the aggregate accrued or
accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, into 100 shares of the common stock,
par value $0.50 per share of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") without
any further action by the relevant holder of such Preferred Shares or the
Company. All Preferred Shares, when so deemed converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a Certificate representing Preferred Shares (each, a "
_Preferred Certificate_ ") or Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration

Certificate (excluding a Preferred Certificate representing Dissenter Shares)
shall be deemed to represent the number of Converted Shares into which the
Preferred Shares represented by such Preferred Certificate have been deemed
converted and (ii) all references to "Certificate" herein shall include any
Preferred Certificate.

   
---|---

canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive, in
cash without interest, $25.00 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender
of the Certificate and/or Letter of Transmittal representing such Shares as
provided in Article II. All Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a Certificate representing Shares (including a Preferred
Certificate representing Converted Shares) or Book-Entry Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which such Shares have been converted, as provided herein.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(c)

  |  

Each Share that is owned by the Company as treasury stock and each Share owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. Each Share owned
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time and no
Merger Consideration shall be payable with respect thereto.

(d)

Section 1.7

  |  

 _Options and Restricted Share Units._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(a)

  |  

Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (collectively, the " _Options_ ")
granted under the Company Equity Plans, whether vested or unvested, which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not been
exercised or canceled prior thereto shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled
and, as of the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to the holder thereof
cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock provided for in such Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
provided for in such Option, which cash payment shall be made without interest
and shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(b)

  |  

Each restricted share unit granted under any Company Equity Plan, agreement or
arrangement of the Company, or otherwise (each, a " _Restricted Share Unit_
"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock covered by such Restricted Share Units, less any required withholdings.
As of the Effective Time, each holder of Restricted Share Units shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(c)

  |  

At the Effective Time, the Company Equity Plans shall terminate and the
provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the
Company shall be of no further force and effect and shall be deemed to be
deleted. The Company shall take all actions necessary in order to effect the
provisions of this _Section 1.7_ , including adopting all necessary
resolutions, reimbursing employees for applicable payroll withholdings
authorized under the ESPP, seeking all necessary approvals and providing any
notices required under the Company Equity Plans.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

     |  

Section 1.8

  |  

 _Dissenter Shares._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenter
Shares shall not be deemed converted into Company Common Stock and converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
1.4(a)_, but instead holders of Dissenter Shares shall be entitled to payment
of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Part 12.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose such holder\'s dissenters\' rights
under Part 12 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Part 12, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Dissenter Shares under
Part 12 shall cease and such Dissenter Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable with respect to the Converted Shares
represented thereby as provided in _Section 1.4(a)_, without interest. At the
Effective Time, the Dissenter Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of

  

 

4  

  

Dissenter Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
such rights provided in the preceding two sentences. The Company shall serve
prompt notice to Parent of any demands for dissenters\' rights under Part 12
of any holder of the Preferred Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the RIBCA received by the
Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, or as otherwise required
under the RIBCA, waive any failure by a holder of Dissenter Shares to timely
deliver a written demand or to perform any other act perfecting dissenter\'s
rights in accordance with the RIBCA, make any payment (or offer to make any
payment) with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing. 
 

  

     |  

Section 1.9

  |  

 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

Subject to the restrictions contained in _Section 5.1_, in the event that the
Company changes the number of Shares issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted to
reflect such change.

  

  

Article II. EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  


 

  

     |  

Section 2.1

  |  

 _Paying Agent._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent to act as
paying agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to this _Article II_ , in the case of certificated
Shares, and automatically, in the case of Book-Entry Shares. Immediately
following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent cash in the aggregate amount required to pay the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Shares pursuant to _Section 1.4_ (such cash
amount being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund
shall be used solely for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article II_ and shall not be used to satisfy any other
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Pending distribution of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with this _Article II_ , Parent may direct the
Paying Agent to invest such cash, provided that such investments (i) shall be
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moody\'s Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, or certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of domestic commercial banks
with capital exceeding $500,000,000 (collectively " _Permitted Investments_ ")

 _Exchange Procedures._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(a)

  |  

As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail
to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares subsequently
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth in
Section 1.4: (i) a letter of transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") that (A)
shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof, together with any
bond or indemnity agreement, as contemplated by Section 2.6) and (B) shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify;
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration.

   
---|---

(b)

  |  

Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together
with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and any other documents reasonably
required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, (i) the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
representing the applicable amount of cash that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and (ii) the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 2.2_, each such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such
surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(c)

  |  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate but
may, if required by the Paying Agent, be required to deliver an executed
Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. Each
holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon
the Effective Time or following the Paying Agent\'s receipt of the applicable
Letter of Transmittal (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares
shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after such time,
the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
_Article II_ and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall immediately be
canceled.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(d)

  |  

In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company maintained by its transfer agent, the
appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if
the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent
properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required
by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable Taxes have been paid.

---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Shares in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Shares and, after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article II_ , subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenter Shares.

  


 

  

     |  

Section 2.4

  |  

 _Termination of Exchange Fund._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income
received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the former
Company Shareholders on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent (or its designee) upon demand, and
any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore received any applicable
Merger Consideration to which such Company Shareholder is entitled under this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of claims
with respect thereto and only as a general creditor thereof.

     |  

Section 2.5

  |  

 _No Liability._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Shares two
years after the Effective Time or at such earlier date as is immediately prior
to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law or Order, become the property of Parent (or its designee) free
and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors,
assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

  

  

     |  

Section 2.6

  |  

 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, or the
execution and delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form
as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, in each case as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

     |  

Section 2.7

  |  

 _Withholding of Tax._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Plan of
Merger, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Dissenter Shares,
Restricted Share Units or Options, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, or
the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law and (b)
treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof, or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be.

Section 3.13

 _Employee Benefit Plans._

   
---|---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(a)

  |  

Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete
list of (i) each "employee benefit plan" (as such term is defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA) (whether or not subject to ERISA) that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries sponsors, maintains, participates in, is a party or
contributes to (or is required to contribute to), or with respect to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have any
liability; and (ii) each other employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement, whether written or oral, including any stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation right, phantom stock or other stock or stock-
based incentive plan, cash bonus or incentive compensation arrangement,
retirement, pension, vacation, holiday, cafeteria, medical, life insurance,
disability, retiree healthcare, retiree life insurance, deferred compensation,
profit sharing, change in control, retention, unemployment, or severance
compensation plan, program, policy or arrangement; and each employment,
severance, change in control or consulting agreement, in each case, for any
current, retired or former employee or director, or other individual service
provider (or for any dependent or beneficiary thereof), of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (each such current, retired or former employee, director,
or other individual service provider, a " _Company Employee_ ") that does not
constitute an "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA),
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries presently sponsors, participates
in, is a party or contributes to (or is required to contribute to), or with
respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be
expected to have any liability (whether or not material, each, a " _Benefit
Plan_ "). Each of the Benefit Plans that is subject to Section 302 or Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code is hereinafter referred to in this
_Section 3.13_ as a " _Title IV Plan_ ".

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

 

16  

  

    

(b)

  |  

With respect to each Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to Parent a
true and complete copy of each Benefit Plan, including any amendments thereto,
and a true and complete copy of the following items (in each case, only if
applicable) (i) each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary
plan description and summary of material modifications, (iii) the most
recently filed annual report on IRS Form 5500, (iv) the most recent financial
statements and actuarial or other valuation reports prepared with respect
thereto, and (v) the most recently received IRS determination or opinion
letter.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(c)

  |  

Except as disclosed in Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any Person that is a member of a "controlled group of
corporations" with, or is under "common control" with, or is a member of the
same "affiliated service group" with the Company, in each case, as defined in
Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ")
maintains, contributes to, or sponsors (or has in the past six years
maintained, contributed to, or sponsored) a multiemployer plan as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "). All required
contributions that the Company or any ERISA Affiliate have been obligated to
make to any Multiemployer Plan have been duly and timely made. Neither the
Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any withdrawal liability with
respect to any Multiemployer Plan. No Multiemployer Plan is a Title IV Plan.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(d)

  |  

With regard to each Title IV Plan that is not a Multiemployer Plan, no
liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their ERISA Affiliates that has not
been satisfied in full, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition
exists that presents a material risk to the Company, its Subsidiaries or its
or their ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability, other than
liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (which
premiums have been paid when due). With respect to each Title IV Plan set
forth on Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter that is not a
Multiemployer Plan: (i) there has not been any failure to satisfy the minimum
funding standards within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302
of ERISA, whether or not waived, and no such plan is in "at risk,"
"endangered" or "critical" status within the meaning of Sections 430 and 432
of the Code; (ii) there has been no "reportable event" within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder which has not been fully
and accurately reported in a timely fashion, as required by applicable Law;
and (iii) there has not been a partial termination.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(e)

  |  

Other than with respect to any Multiemployer Plan (as to which the Company
makes no representation or warranty), each Benefit Plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. There are no
pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened actions, suits,
disputes or claims by or on behalf of any Benefit Plan, by any Company
Employee or beneficiary covered under any such Benefit Plan, as applicable, or
otherwise involving any such Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits). Each Benefit Plan that constitutes a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code is in
documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all
applicable IRS guidance thereunder so as to avoid any interest, penalty or Tax
under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(f)

  |  

With respect to each Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (other than any Multiemployer Plan as to
which the Company makes no representation or warranty), (i) each such Benefit
Plan has been determined to be so qualified and has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect
to its qualification, (ii) the trusts maintained thereunder have been
determined to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and
(iii) no event has occurred that could reasonably be expected to result in
disqualification or adversely affect such exemption.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

 

17  

  

    

(g)

  |  

Other than with respect to any Multiemployer Plan (as to which the Company
makes no representation or warranty), no Benefit Plan provides welfare
benefits, including death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), beyond
retirement or termination of service, other than coverage mandated solely by
applicable Law.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(h)

  |  

The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Plan of Merger will not, either alone or in combination with another event,
(i) entitle any Company Employee to severance pay, unemployment compensation
or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting, or funding, or
increase the amount of compensation due any such Company Employee.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(i)

  |  

No amounts payable under the Benefit Plans will fail to be deductible for
federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code as a result
of the occurrence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either
alone or in combination with another event.

There is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown, stoppage or lockout actually

Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are (a)
party to any collective bargaining agreements or similar labor agreements, (b)
subject to any action, complaint, charge, inquiry, proceeding or investigation
brought, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by or on behalf of any
employee, prospective employee, former employee, labor organization or other
representative of the Company\'s employees, which action, complaint, charge,
inquiry, proceeding or investigation, if adversely decided, may reasonably,
individually or in the aggregate, create a Liability material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (c) any grievance or arbitration
proceeding whether pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
which, if adversely decided, may reasonably, individually or in the aggregate,
create a Liability material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, or cause the Company to incur expenses or forego operating savings
which would be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (d) a party to, or otherwise bound by,
any consent decree with, or citation by, any Governmental Entity relating to
employees or employment practices. The Company and its Subsidiaries are, and
have at all times been, in material compliance with all applicable Laws
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment, wages, hours of work and occupational safety and health, and are
not engaged in any unfair labor practices as defined in the National Labor
Relations Act, the Railway Labor Act or other applicable Law. To the Knowledge
of the Company, no Governmental Entity responsible for the enforcement of
labor or employment Laws intends to conduct an investigation with respect to
or relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and no such investigation is
in progress.

Notification Act of 1988 (or similar state or local laws) (the " _WARN Act_ ")
affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units
within any site of employment or facility of the Company or any Subsidiary, or
(ii) a "mass layoff" as defined in the WARN Act affecting any site of
employment or facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since
January 1, 2014, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have been
affected by any transaction or engaged in layoffs or employment terminations
sufficient in number to trigger application of any Law similar to the WARN
Act.

trademarks, trademark applications, trade names, service marks, service mark

intellectual property rights, " _Intellectual Property Rights_ ") that, in
each case, are material to the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as presently conducted and, each of the

Adverse Effect, the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company owns, or is
licensed or otherwise has the right to use, each such scheduled Intellectual
Property Right that is used in the conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, as presently conducted. To the Knowledge of the Company, the

the Knowledge of the Company, threatened that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is infringing the rights of any Person with regard to any
Intellectual Property Right, except for such infringements, misappropriations,

to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, no Person
is infringing the rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Intellectual Property Right, in a manner that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries under any Company Material Contract, Material Lease or Other
Material Contract and no other party to such Company Material Contract,
Material Lease or Other Material Contract is, to the Knowledge of the Company,

conducted. All the Railroad Assets material to the operation of the business

other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to

combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

(a)

From the date hereof to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
the Representatives of the Company to, (i) afford the Representatives of
Parent and Merger Sub, upon reasonable prior written notice, which shall be
directed to the Company\'s General Counsel, reasonable access during normal
business hours to the officers, employees, agents (including outside
accountants), properties, offices and other facilities, books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish to Parent and its
Representatives such financial and operating data and other information as
such Persons may reasonably request subject, however, to Antitrust Laws.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be obligated to provide any such access or information to the extent
that doing so (i) would be reasonably likely to cause a waiver of an attorney-
client privilege or loss of attorney work product protection, (ii) would
constitute a violation of any applicable Law or (iii) would violate any
agreement in effect on the date hereof with a third-party to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (it being agreed that the parties shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause such access or information to be
provided in a manner that does not cause such waiver, loss or violation
including by making substitute arrangements). Neither Parent nor any of its
Representatives shall be permitted to perform any onsite procedure (including
any intrusive onsite environmental investigation), other than ordinary course
operational visits for integration planning, with respect to any property of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the Company\'s consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

31  

  

    

(b)

  |  

Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold, and shall cause their respective
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives to hold, all information received, directly or indirectly,
from the Company or its Representatives in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any use restrictions or other similar limitations set forth therein shall
be inapplicable with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any proposal, negotiations or actions by or on behalf of Parent
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including
in response to a notice pursuant to _Section 5.6_).

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(c)

  |  

No investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

Section 5.3

(a)

  |  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such
party pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the
most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining all necessary, proper
or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, qualifications and
approvals from Governmental Entities and making all necessary, proper or
advisable registrations, filings and notices and taking all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval, waiver or exemption from any Governmental
Entity (including under, if applicable, the HSR Act, and from the STB); (ii)
obtaining all necessary, proper or advisable consents, qualifications,
approvals, waivers or exemptions from non-governmental Third Parties; and
(iii) executing and delivering any additional documents or instruments
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by,
and to fully carry out the purposes of, the Transaction Documents.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(b)

  |  

Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall, as soon
as possible but in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days of the date
hereof, file with the STB the appropriate and necessary documentation for the
approval or exemption, as the case may be, of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent also shall, as soon as possible following such
filing, submit a form of voting trust agreement to the STB seeking a written
informal opinion that the voting trust would insulate Parent from unauthorized
control of the Company if (i) Parent has not received from the STB the
approval or exemption, as the case may be, of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby before the Effective Time and (ii) the stock of the
Surviving Corporation is placed into the voting trust immediately following
the Effective Time. Parent shall bear its own costs for the preparation of
such filings and responding to any inquiries or information requests, if
applicable, and Parent shall be responsible for the payment of any applicable
filing fees. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another (A) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such
approval or exemption, and (B) in keeping the other party reasonably informed
of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, the STB, regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to _Section 5.3(c)_, Parent and the Company shall
permit the Company and Parent, respectively, to review prior to filing, all
documents proposed by Parent or Merger Sub or the Company, respectively, to be
filed with the STB, any other Governmental Entity or any court to secure
approval or exemption of the transactions contemplated hereby.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

 

32  

  

    

(c)

  |  

In addition to and without limiting the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall cooperate with one another (i) in promptly determining whether
any filings or other submissions are required to be or should be made or
consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or should be
obtained under the HSR Act or any other federal, state or foreign Law or
regulation or whether any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or
should be obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other contracts or
instruments material to the Company\'s business in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) in
promptly making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any such consents, permits,
authorizations, approvals or waivers, and (iii) in keeping the other party
reasonably informed, including by providing the other party with a copy of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Entity, of any communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

    

(d)

  |  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this _Section 5.3_ as "Antitrust Counsel
Only Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the Antitrust Law outside counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or
consultants of the recipient or any of its Affiliates unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the
Company or Parent as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each of the
Company and Parent shall direct their respective Antitrust Law outside
counsels to comply with this _Section 5.3_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.3_, materials provided to the other party or its
counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and privileged communications.

(e)

  |  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained
in this _Section 5.3_, if any objections are asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other
applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law or which
would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) resolve any
such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections
or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) avoid or eliminate
impediments under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Termination
Date), including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit the freedom
of Parent or its Subsidiaries\' (including the Surviving Corporation\'s)
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
its or its Subsidiaries\' (including the Surviving Corporation\'s) businesses,
product lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the Closing.

(f)

  |  

In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) against Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or any of their respective directors or officers by a Governmental
Entity challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other, and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(g)

  |  

The Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
notify Parent of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) any actions, suits, claims,
litigations, investigations or proceedings, including any shareholder
litigation, commenced, threatened or, to its Knowledge, contemplated against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any of its or their officers or the Company Board of Directors,
that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, or that relate to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof, including by promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) providing Parent copies of all proceedings and correspondence
relating to such action, suit, claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding.
The Company shall reasonably consult with Parent with respect to (and allow
Parent to participate in), and shall consider in good faith Parent\'s advice
with respect to, the defense or settlement of any such action, suit, claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding, and no settlement, agreement to
settle or action taken to settle thereof shall be agreed to without Parent\'s
prior written consent.

(a)

  |  

As soon as practicable after execution of this Agreement (but in no event
later than twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement), the
Company shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and file with the SEC, a
proxy statement which shall (as amended or supplemented from time to time)
constitute the Proxy Statement. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will
furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in
the Proxy Statement as reasonably requested by the Company. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof and to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the staff of the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. The Company shall notify
Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and
of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall consult with Parent
regarding, and supply Parent with copies of, all correspondence between the
Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. As promptly as
practicable after comments are received from the SEC thereon and after the
furnishing by the Company and Parent of all information required to be
contained therein, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and
the Company shall file any required amendments to the Proxy Statement, and the
definitive Proxy Statement, with the SEC. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement, any proposed amendment of or supplement to the Proxy Statement or
responding to any SEC comments on the Proxy Statement, the Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document, which comments the Company shall consider in good faith and accept
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested by Parent in
connection therewith. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information promptly shall be filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared
by the SEC and shall thereafter mail to the Company Shareholders as promptly
as possible the Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials for the Company
Shareholders Meeting.

The Company agrees that (i) it and its officers and directors shall not, (ii)
its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries\' officers and directors shall not and
(iii) it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries\' other Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take
any other action to knowingly facilitate, the making of any proposal that

contacting or engaging in discussions with the Person making a Takeover
Proposal or its representatives for the sole purpose of clarifying such
Takeover Proposal) or (B) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
confidential information with respect to or that could reasonably be expected

immediately cease and cause to be terminated all then existing discussions and
negotiations with any Person conducted theretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal, shall terminate data room access of all such Persons and
shall request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Required Vote, in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Takeover Proposal, if the Company has not breached its obligations
under this _Section 5.6_ and if the Company Board of Directors determines (x)
after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its financial
advisor and outside counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation
with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, the Company may (and may authorize and permit its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and Representatives to), subject
to compliance with _Section 5.6(d)_, (A) furnish information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal
(and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing confidentiality provisions substantially similar to those set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and

withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board of
Directors or any such committee of this Agreement, the Plan of Merger or the
Merger (or take any other action or make any other public statement
inconsistent with such recommendation) or (B) recommend the approval or
adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or
adopt, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,

Proposal, other than any confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section
5.6(a)_ or (iii) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, and
subject to compliance with this _Section 5.6_, the Company Board of Directors
may, if, after consultation with, and taking into account the advice of, its
outside counsel, it determines that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, in response to a
bona fide Takeover Proposal which did not result from a breach of _Section
5.6_ and which the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (1) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
(2) cause or permit the Company to terminate this Agreement in order to enter
into a definitive agreement regarding such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, and the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to clause (2) above, until after the third Business Day following
Parent\'s receipt of written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from
the Company advising Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to
take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the material
terms and conditions of (and documents relating to) any Superior Proposal (and
the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal) that is the basis of
the proposed action by such Company Board of Directors and a statement that
the Company Board of Directors intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)_ and during such three Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall engage in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to, among other things, amend
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents in such a manner that (i) any
Takeover Proposal which was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no
longer is a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure of the Company Board of
Directors to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would no longer be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that (I) any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Superior Proposal and a new three (3) Business Day period and (II) in
determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or to cause or
permit the Company to so terminate this Agreement, the Company Board of
Directors shall take into account any changes to the financial or other terms
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents proposed by Parent to
the Company in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, and the
Company Board of Directors at the end of the negotiation period, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, shall have
in good faith reaffirmed its determination that such bona fide Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal).

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior
to obtaining the Company Required Vote, and subject to compliance with this
_Section 5.6_ , the Company Board of Directors may, if, after consultation
with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside counsel, it
determines that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law in response to an Intervening Event,
make an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board of Directors shall not make such an Adverse Recommendation
Change until after the third Business Day following Parent\'s receipt of
written notice (a " _Notice of Intervening Event_ ") from the Company advising
Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor, which notice shall include a description of
the applicable Intervening Event, and during such three Business Day period,
if requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall engage in
good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to, among other
things, amend this Agreement and the Transaction Documents in such a manner
that (i) the need for making such Adverse Recommendation Change is obviated
and (ii) the failure of the Company Board of Directors to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would no longer be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that (I) any
material change in respect of such Intervening Event shall require a new
Notice of Intervening Event and a new three (3) Business Day period and (II)
in determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
Board of Directors shall take into account any changes to the financial or
other terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents proposed by
Parent to the Company in response to a Notice of Intervening Event or
otherwise).

thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal or
request for information or other inquiry. The Company shall, subject to the

(e)

  |  

The Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall be permitted to pay, at

Surviving Corporation\'s Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, give Transferred
Employees full credit for such Transferred Employees\' service with the

for purposes of benefit accruals (except for vacation and severance), under
any benefit plans made generally available to employees or officers or any
class or level of employees or officers maintained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which a Transferred
Employee participates to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or Parent\'s or the

which Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate following the
Effective Time, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to
such employees as of the Effective Time under the analogous Benefit Plan, (ii)
honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in
which they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time during the
portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
which they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time in the same

were incurred and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a Transferred
Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time, in

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no current or former
employee, director or individual independent contractor or any individual

beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing contained herein, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any Transferred Employee or any other Person any
benefits under any benefit plans, programs, policies or other arrangements,
including severance benefits or the right to employment or continued
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates for any period by reason of this Agreement. No
provision of this _Section 5.8_ constitutes an employment agreement or an
amendment to or adoption of any employee benefit plan of or by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates or shall
alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established,

plan, program, agreement or arrangement and applicable Law. Following the
Effective Time, nothing contained in this _Section 5.8_ shall interfere with

Affiliates\' right to terminate the employment of any employee for any reason.

Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
_however_ , that at Parent\'s option in lieu of the foregoing insurance
coverage, the Company shall purchase prior to the Effective Time six (6) year

any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
