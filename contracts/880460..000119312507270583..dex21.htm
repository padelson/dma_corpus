_Recitals_

Each of the respective Boards of Directors of E Com and Model deems it

Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ "), pursuant to which all of the shares of common
stock, no par value, of Model (the " _Model Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding will be converted into the right to receive an aggregate of
5,900,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value of E Com (the " _E Com Common
Stock_ ") and Common Stock Warrants Purchase Warrants to acquire 1,500,000
shares of E Com Common Stock in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the "
_Warrants_ " and, together with such shares of E Com Common Stock, the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions
provided for in this Agreement, and such surviving entity will be a wholly-
owned subsidiary of E Com (the " _Merger_ "); and

The respective Boards of Directors of E Com and Model have adopted, the sole
member of Acquisition Sub has approved and the shareholders of Model
have each approved this Agreement and the Merger.

_Agreements_

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, E Com, Acquisition Sub and Model hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1 - PRELIMINARY ACTIONS

applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations, decrees and
orders of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ ") and its current
certificate of incorporation and by-laws:



 

\- 1 - (a) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting
of E Coms shareholders (the " _Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the purposes of
obtaining the affirmative vote of E Coms shareholders in favor of (i) the
issuance of E Com Common Stock and the Warrants pursuant to the Merger and the

(b) in consultation with Model, prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary

shareholders at the earliest practicable date;  _provided_ that no amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement shall be made by E Com without
consultation with Model.

Agreement, whenever any party hereto becomes aware of any event or change
which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy

unless another time, place or date, or any or all, are agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing is held is herein referred
to as the " _Closing Date_ ".



 

\- 2 - 2.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on the
Closing Date the parties shall file certificates of merger with the
Department of State of the State of New York and the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware pursuant to the applicable provisions of the BCL and the
DLLCA (each, the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the BCL and the DLLCA, and shall make all other

time at which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

and duties of the Surviving Entity.

of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
managers and officers of the Surviving Entity until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death,

agreement of the Surviving Entity.

2.7 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders of any securities of
Acquisition Sub or Model:

(a) The issued and outstanding shares of Model Common Stock at the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become an aggregate of 5,900,000
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of E Com Common Stock and

\- 3 - (c) Each outstanding membership interest of Acquisition Sub shall remain
issued, outstanding and unchanged and owned by E Com.

paid upon the surrender or exchange of stock certificates representing shares
of Model Common Stock (collectively, the " _Certificates_ ") in accordance
with the terms of this _Article 2_ and shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Model Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Model shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Model Common Stock on the
records of Model, except for the cancellation of such shares in connection
with the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Model Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, bona fide Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_.

(b) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by E Com, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as E Com may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, E Com will pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Model Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article 2_
, in which event such Certificate shall be deemed cancelled.

2.9 _Escrow Fund_.

At the Closing, E Com shall retain and not deliver to the Model Shareholders
certificates representing 295,000 shares of the Merger Consideration (the "
_Escrow Shares_ ", including all dividends, distributions or
earnings attributable thereto, collectively, the " _Escrow Fund_ ") subject
to the terms hereof for the purpose of securing the indemnification rights of
E Com under this Agreement, such Escrow Shares being allocated among the
holders of Model Common Stock as set forth on _Schedule 2.7_. After the
Closing, E Com shall act as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") with respect
to the Escrow Fund. Any dividends, distributions or earnings on the Escrow
Shares held in the Escrow Fund shall be deposited by the Escrow Agent in an
interest bearing bank account established by the Escrow Agent for such
purpose. The Escrow Agent shall comply with the procedures pertaining to the
Escrow Fund and any disputes related thereto as set forth in _Article 8_
below. Voting rights to the Escrow Shares shall be exercisable by or on behalf
of the Model  



 

\- 4 -  Shareholders in proportion to the respective allocations of the Escrow
Shares. On the thirtieth (30th) day following the filing of E Coms first
Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC following the Closing that includes
audited financial statements that reflect at least six (6) months of post-
merger operations of the Surviving Entity, or if such day shall not be a
Business Day on the next succeeding Business Day (the " _Escrow Release Date_
"), the Escrow Agent will deliver the remaining shares of E Com Common Stock
in the Escrow Fund, if any, and any dividends, distributions or earnings with
respect to such Escrow Shares then held in the Escrow Fund and accrued
interest thereon, to the Model Shareholders pro rata based upon their
respective allocations of the Escrow Shares ; _provided, however_ , that
subject to and in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_ , the Escrow Agent
shall withhold from delivery of the Escrow Fund such number of Escrow Shares
as shall have a value, based upon the Consideration Per Share Price, equal to
any amounts then in dispute relating to indemnification obligations arising
under this Agreement, _provided further_ that the withheld Escrow Shares, to
the extent not applied in satisfaction of indemnification obligations
pursuant to _Article 8_ , shall be delivered to the Model Shareholders pro
rata based upon their respective allocations of the Escrow Shares upon
resolution of such dispute.

ARTICLE 3 - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF E COM

E Com represents and warrants to Model that, except as set forth in the
disclosure letter delivered by E Com to Model simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement (the " _E Com Disclosure Schedule_ "):

3.1 _Organization_.

(a) E Com is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Florida and has the requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. E Com
is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on E Com and would not reasonably be
expected to prevent or delay E Coms performance of its obligations under
this Agreement.

(b) Each of E Coms Subsidiaries, including without limitation Acquisition
Sub, listed on _Section 3.1(b)_ of the E Com Disclosure Schedule is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power and authority to
own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted. Acquisition Sub has not filed an election under
Treasury Regulation 301.7701-3 to be classified other than as provided in
Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(b) or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law, and shall not make such election prior to the Effective
Time. Acquisition Sub has never had greater than one owner at any time during
its existence, or had any owner than its current owner, and agrees that such
owner shall not be changed or added to prior to the Effective Time. E Com has
made  



 

\- 5 -  available to Model a complete and correct copy of the certificates of
incorporation or formation, and by-laws or limited liability company
agreements (or comparable documents), each as amended to date, of each such
Subsidiary. Each Subsidiary is duly licensed or qualified to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to E
Com. Other than the Subsidiaries listed on _Section 3.1(b)_ of the E Com
Disclosure Schedule, E Com does not have any Subsidiaries, and does not own,
directly or indirectly, any equity securities or other interests or capital
stock of any Person.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

The authorized capital stock of E Com consists of 6,250,000 shares, $0.01 par
value, of E Com Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares, $0.10 par value, of
preferred stock of E Com. At the close of business on December 20, 2007,
there were 3,059,041 shares of E Com Common Stock and no shares of preferred
stock of E Com issued and outstanding, and 898,249 shares were held by E Com
in its treasury. As of December 20, 2007, there were 144,696 shares of E Com
Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options
under the Stock Plans and 444,445 shares of E Com Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon the conversion of the Companys $5,000,000
Subordinated Promissory Note dated December 9, 2004 payable to the order to
Stephen Nussdorf and Glenn Nussdorf. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Stock
Plans_ " shall mean the following plans of E Com: the 2000 Stock Option Plan,
the Directors 2000 Stock Option Plan, and any other stock option plan,
program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock or equity of E Com. All E Com capital
stock, voting securities and equity interests have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. Except as set forth above, E Com does not have outstanding any shares
of its capital stock, voting securities or equity interests or any options,
warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities or rights that may result in
the issuance of any shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests of E Com, including, without limitation, any right to purchase E
Com Common Stock, phantom stock rights, stock appreciation right or stock
based performance units. _Section 3.2(a)_ of the E Com Disclosure Schedule
includes a list of all outstanding options and warrants to purchase E Com
Common Stock, the holders thereof and the related exercise prices thereof.

3.3 _Authority_.

(a) Each of E Com and Acquisition Sub has all necessary corporate, in the case
of E Com, and limited liability company, in the case of Acquisition
Sub, power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Warrants
and the Registration Rights Agreement to the extent it is a party thereto and,
subject, in the case of E Com, to obtaining E Com Shareholder Approval. The
execution, delivery and performance by each of E Com and Acquisition Sub of
this Agreement, the Warrants and the Registration  



 

\- 6 -  Rights Agreement to the extent it is a party thereto, and the consummation
by each of the Transactions, have been duly authorized and approved by the
Board of Directors of E Com, the Board of Managers of Acquisition Sub and the
sole member of Acquisition Sub.

(b) The Special Committee, at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously
approved the Transactions and recommended the adoption of this Agreement to
the Board of Directors of E Com, subject to the right of the Special Committee
to withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation if the Special Committee
determines, in good faith, that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to E Coms
shareholders under applicable Law.

(c) E Coms Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has duly
adopted resolutions: (i) determining that the terms of the Merger are fair
from a financial point of view to the holders of E Com Common Stock (other
than shareholders of E Com who own, or whose Affiliates own, securities of
Model), (ii) adopting this Agreement and declaring advisable this Agreement
and the Transactions and (iii) recommending that the shareholders of E Com
approve the issuance of shares of E Com Common Stock and the Warrants pursuant
to the Merger and the issuance of E Com Common Stock upon exercise of the
Warrants, subject to the right of the Board of Directors of E Com to
withdraw, modify or amend such recommendation to the extent that the Board of
Directors of E Com determines, in good faith, that failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to E
Coms shareholders under applicable Law.

(d) Except for the E Com Shareholder Approval in the case of E Com, no
corporate action not yet taken on the part of E Com or Acquisition Sub is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by E Com or
Acquisition Sub of this Agreement, the Warrants and the Registration Rights
Agreement to the extent it is a party thereto and the consummation by each of
the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each
of E Com and Acquisition Sub and constitutes and, following their execution
and delivery by the parties thereto, each Warrant and Registration Rights
Agreement will each constitute, a valid and binding obligation of E Com and
Acquisition Sub, to the extent it is a party thereto, enforceable against E
Com or Acquisition Sub, as applicable, in accordance with its terms, except
that such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws of general application
affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally (the
" _Bankruptcy Exception_ ").

3.4 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Special Committee has received the
opinion of Financo, Inc., dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect
that, as of such date, and subject to the various assumptions and
qualifications set forth therein, the consideration to be paid by E Com in the
Merger is fair to the shareholders of E Com (other than shareholders of E Com

standing under the laws of the State of New York and has the requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Model
has made available to E Com a complete and correct copy of its certificate of
incorporation and by-laws as amended to date (the " _Model Charter Documents_
"). Model is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Model and would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay Models performance of its
obligations under this Agreement.

(b) _Section 4.1(b)_ of the Model Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all of Models Subsidiaries. Each of Models Subsidiaries is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power and authority to
own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted. Each such Model Subsidiary is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed,
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Model. Other than the Subsidiaries
listed on _Section 4.1(b)_ of the Model Disclosure Schedule, Model does not
have any Subsidiaries, and does not own, directly or indirectly, any equity
securities or other interests or capital stock of any Person.

4.2 _Capitalization_.

securities or equity interests of Model, including, without limitation, any
right to purchase Model Common Stock, phantom stock rights, stock
appreciation right or stock based performance units. There are no agreements
which would obligate Model (whether by the terms of the creating instrument or
upon the demand or request of the holder thereof) to issue or repurchase any
of its capital stock.

4.3 _Authority_.

(a) Model has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to

Transactions and (iii) recommending that the Model Shareholders approve this
Agreement.

necessary to adopt and authorize this Agreement and approve and authorize the
Transactions.

(d) No other corporate action on the part of Model is necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance by Model of this Agreement and

Model, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy Exception.

provision of Models

(ii) incurred after the Model Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, or (iii) reflected on the Model

control ninety percent (90%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of E
Com Common Stock prior to such transaction.

5.10 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Regardless of the accuracy of the representations and warranties in
_Section 4.9_ of this Agreement, the Model Shareholders shall be responsible
for and shall indemnify and hold E Com and its Affiliates harmless against (i)
all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of Model and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through
the end of the Closing Date of any taxable period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date ( _"_ _Pre-Closing Tax Period __"_ ), (ii) all Taxes
of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of
which Model or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the
foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local,
or foreign law or regulation, (iii) any and all Taxes of any person imposed on
any of Model or its Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract or
pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring before the Closing Date provided, however, that in the
case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, Model Shareholders shall be liable
only to the extent that such Taxes are in excess of the amount, if any,
reserved for such Taxes (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established
to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) on the face of the
Model Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes thereto), as such reserve is
adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with
past custom and practice of Model and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax
Returns, but excluding any income Taxes resulting from unusual gains or losses
outside of the ordinary course of business occurring after the date of this
Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date and, provided further, for
purposes of the Tax indemnification provided by this _Section 5.10_, the
Merger contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to occur after the Pre-
Closing Tax Period. In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any
taxable period that begins before the Closing Date but ends after the Closing
Date (the " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of any Taxes based on or
measured by income or receipts of Model or its Subsidiaries for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period for any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
any of Model and/or its Subsidiaries holds a beneficial interest shall be
deemed to terminate at such time); and the amount of all other Taxes for a
Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period. Payment by the indemnifying party of any amount due
under this  _Section 5.10(a)_ shall be made within ten days following
written notice by the indemnified party that payment of such amounts to the
appropriate taxing authority is due, provided, that the indemnifying party
shall not be required to make any payment earlier than two days before it is
due to the appropriate taxing authority.



 

\- 29 - (b) E Com shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Pre-Closing Period Returns due after the Closing Date and E Com
shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all
Straddle Period Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that in the case of any such Tax Returns, the Shareholder
Representative shall have the right (prior to filing) to review and comment on
any such Tax Return and E Com shall consider such comments in good faith. All
such Tax Returns shall be true and correct in all material respects.

(c) In the case of any Pre-Closing Period Return, E Com shall provide the
Shareholder Representative: (i) a copy of such Tax Return as filed or to be
filed; (ii) a schedule computing the Tax shown as due on any such Pre-Closing
Period Return or the portion of the Tax shown as due on any such Straddle
Period Return which relates to the portion of the period covered by such
Straddle Return ending on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax_ "). Within
the time period prescribed in _Section 5.10(a)_, Model Shareholders shall
indemnify E Com or its Affiliates against any Pre-Closing Tax that is due and
payable, to the extent in excess of the amount of Taxes reserved (excluding
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) on the face of the Model Balance Sheet (rather
than in any notes thereto).

(d) E Com and the Model Shareholders shall reasonably cooperate, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates, agents, auditors, representatives,
officers and employees to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all
Tax Returns to be filed by E Com and conducting any Tax audits and proceedings
relating to Pre-Closing Taxes.

(e) All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or
involving Model and its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing
Date and, after the Closing Date, Model and its Subsidiaries shall not be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.



 

\- 30 - (f) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charged
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation by this Agreement shall be borne by the Model Shareholders.

(i) For Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat all payments made under this
_Section 5.10_ and under any other indemnity provisions contained in this
Agreement, and for any breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements, as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

(ii) This _Section 5.10_ and _Section 8.4(b)_ shall be the sole provisions
governing indemnities for Taxes under this Agreement.

(iii) For purposes of this _Section 5.10_, all references to Model or its
Affiliates shall include successors.

(iv) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in this _Section
5.10_ shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force indefinitely.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, no limits on indemnification contained in
_Section 8.1_ or _9.1_ shall apply to indemnification for Taxes.

5.11 _Voting E Com Common Stock_. Each Model Shareholder, who is an E Com
Shareholder, agrees to vote his, her or its shares of E Com Common Stock in
favor of the matters for which the E Com Shareholder Approval is being
sought. 

5.12 _Filing of Listing Application and Blue Sky Forms_. The parties shall use
commercially reasonably efforts to file any required listing applications
with Nasdaq with respect to the shares of E Com Common Stock and Warrants to
be issued pursuant to the Merger and the shares of E Com Common Stock to be
issued upon exercise of the Warrants and any federal or state forms, notices
or other documents relating to the issuance of such securities required to be
filed under applicable state or federal securities laws.

notice of such inaccuracy, breach or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Model may only exercise this termination right prior to the Closing Date.



 

\- 35 - 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in  _Section 7.1_, written notice thereof shall be given to the
other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such

survive termination of this Agreement for any reason, and there shall be no
liability on the part of E Com or Model or their respective directors,
officers and affiliates, except nothing shall relieve any party from liability
for fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 8 - INDEMNIFICATION.

8.1 _Obligation to Indemnify_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
_Article 8_ , E Com shall be entitled to indemnification from and against all
losses, damages and out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses of outside counsel, accountants and other professional fees,
costs of investigation, court costs and other expenses) incurred by E Com in
the investigation, collection, prosecution or defense of any claims, whether
or not involving a third Person, suits, actions, claims, deficiencies,
liabilities, penalties, and fines (but not including punitive, exemplary,
consequential and all other kinds of special damages, including, without
limitation, lost profits and opportunity costs, unless such punitive,
exemplary, consequential or other kind of special damages are awarded to a
Person in a Third-Party Claim) (" _Losses_ ") sustained or incurred as a
result of, relating to or caused by (i) any misrepresentation, breach of the
representations and warranties of Model or a Model Shareholder contained in
this Agreement or any certificate, schedule, document or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto, or (ii) other than with respect to the breach by
Model of any of its covenants or agreements hereunder that was to be performed
on or prior to the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Covenant Breach_ ") which
shall be governed by _Article 7_ and the failure to make payments under
_Sections 5.10_ and _8.4(b)_ , any breach of any of the covenants and
agreements of Model or a Model Shareholder contained in this Agreement or any
certificate, schedule, document or other writing delivered pursuant hereto;
_provided_ that E Com shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement unless a claim is timely asserted during the applicable survival
period specified in _Section 9.1_ by means of an Indemnification Notice
meeting in all material respects the requirements of _Section 8.2(a)_.

The rights of E Com to indemnification under this  _Section 8.1_ (other than
as to Pre-Closing Taxes) shall be limited as follows:



     | (A) | The amount of any Losses incurred by E Com shall be reduced
by the net amount of the Tax Benefits actually realized by E Com or any of its
Affiliates by reason of such Losses and shall be increased by the amount of
any Tax to be incurred by E Com or any of its Affiliates (and grossed up for
such increase) as a result of the receipt of indemnity payments with respect
to any such Loss. 
---|---|--- 


 

\- 36 - reduced by the net amount E Com or any of its Affiliates recovers (after
deducting all reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and other costs of
recovery) from any insurer or other party liable for such Losses, and E Com
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect any such recovery. 
---|---|--- 


     | (C) | E Com shall be entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 8.1_ only to the extent that the aggregate amount of Losses
(reduced, without duplication, as provided in paragraphs (A) and (B) above)
exceeds on a cumulative basis $1,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), and then only
for the amount of any such excess. 
---|---|--- 


     | (D) | In no event will E Com be entitled to indemnification under
this _Section 8.1_ for any individual item (or series of related items) of
Loss (as reduced in accordance with paragraphs (A) and (B) above) that is
less than $10,000 and each such item will not be taken into account in
determining whether the aggregate amount of Losses exceeds the Threshold. 
---|---|--- 


     | (E) | In any event the maximum amount for which E Com shall be
entitled to indemnification in the aggregate under this _Section 8.1_ (as
reduced, without duplication, in accordance with paragraphs (A), (B), (C) and
(D) above) shall not exceed the Escrow Fund. 
---|---|--- 



     | (F) | Except as provided in _Sections 5.10_ and _8.4(b)_ and Pre-
Closing Covenant Breaches, the Escrow Shares and the Escrow Fund shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to E Com for any Losses arising out of
any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and the
maximum amount that may be recovered from any Model Shareholder shall be
limited to such persons pro rata share of the Escrow Shares. 
---|---|--- 



     | (G) | For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses incurred
arising out of or relating to any breach of a representation or warranty by
Model or a Model Shareholder, the references to Knowledge, Material Adverse
Effect or other materiality qualifications shall be disregarded. 
---|---|--- 

8.2 _Indemnification Notice Procedures_.

(a) Promptly after the discovery of any Losses for which it may be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8,_ E Com shall deliver to the
Shareholder Representative a notice (the " _Indemnification Notice_ "), which
Indemnification Notice shall:



 

\- 37 - (i) state that E Com has paid or incurred Losses for which E Com is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and

(ii) specify in reasonable detail each individual item of Loss, the basis for
any anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or breach of covenant to which each such item is related and, if then
known, the amount to which E Com claims to be entitled hereunder.

(b) In the event that the Shareholder Representative shall object to the
indemnification of E Com in respect of any claim or claims specified in
any Indemnification Notice, the Shareholder Representative shall, within
forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Shareholder Representative of such
Indemnification Notice, deliver to E Com a notice to such effect and the
Shareholder Representative and E Com shall, within the sixty (60) day period
beginning on the date of receipt by E Com of such objection, attempt in good
faith to agree as to the disposition of each of such claims to which the
Shareholder Representative shall have so objected. If E Com and the Seller
Representative shall succeed in reaching agreement with respect to any of such
claims, E Com and the Seller Representative shall promptly prepare and sign a
memorandum setting forth such agreement. Should E Com and the Seller
Representative be unable to agree as to any particular item or items or amount
or amounts within such time period, then either the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party may submit such dispute to arbitration as provided in
_Section 9.12_.

(c) Claims for Losses specified in any Indemnification Notice to which the
Shareholder Representative shall not object in writing within forty-five (45)
days after receipt of such Indemnification Notice, claims for Losses covered
by a memorandum of agreement of the nature described in _Section 8.2(b)_, and
claims for Losses the validity and amount of which have been the subject of
judicial determination as described in _Section 8.2(b)_ or shall have been
settled with the consent of the Shareholder Representative, as described in 
_Section 8.3_, are hereinafter referred to, collectively, as " _Agreed
Claims_ ".

8.3 _Third-Party Claims_. 

(a) E Com agrees to give the Shareholder Representative notice in writing of
the assertion of any claim or demand made by, or an action, proceeding or
investigation instituted by, any Person not a party to this Agreement (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity will be sought under
_Section 8.1_ in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in _Section
8.2_ promptly after E Com learns of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder, except to the extent there shall
have been actual prejudice to the defense of such Third-Party Claim by the  



 

\- 38 -  Shareholder Representative as a result of such failure (except that there
shall be no right to indemnification under this _Article 8_ for any
expenses incurred during the period in which E Com failed to give such
notice). Thereafter, E Com shall deliver to the Shareholder Representative,
within five (5) Business Days after E Coms receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by E Com relating to
the Third-Party Claim.

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against E Com, the Shareholder
Representative will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof. The
Shareholder Representative may elect to assume the defense, at Model
Shareholders expense and by counsel selected by the Shareholder
Representative, of any Third-Party Claim in accordance with the following
conditions:

(i) If such Third-Party Claim involves (and continues to involve) solely
monetary damages and the Shareholder Representative agrees in writing with E
Com that E Com shall be entitled (subject to any applicable limitations in
_Section 8.1_) to indemnification hereunder as to such claim and the amount
of such claim can be satisfied from the Escrow Fund, then the Shareholder
Representative may assume the defense of such claim and, subject to _Section
8.3(d)_, may not settle such claim without the consent of E Com, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(ii) If such Third-Party Claim involves both monetary damages and
injunctive relief against E Com, then the Shareholder Representative may
assume the defense of such claim and may settle that portion of such claim
involving solely monetary damages in accordance with clause (i) above, as
applicable, mutatis mutandis, but shall not settle any portion of such claim
involving injunctive relief without the consent of E Com, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(iii) If such Third-Party Claim involves (and continues to involve) solely
injunctive relief against E Com, E Com shall control the defense of such
claim and shall not settle any portion of such claim for monetary damages
without the consent of the Shareholder Representative, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(iv) In all cases, if the parties in any action shall include both Model
and/or a Model Shareholder, on the one hand, and E Com, on the other hand,
and E Com shall have reasonably concluded that counsel selected by the
Shareholder Representative has a conflict of interest because of the
availability of conflicting defenses, E Com shall have the right to select
separate counsel to participate in the defense of such action on its behalf.

(c) Subject to the foregoing, if the Shareholder Representative elects to
assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, it shall notify E Com of the
Shareholder Representatives intent to do so within thirty (30) days (or
sooner, if the nature of the Third-  



 

\- 39 -  Party Claim so requires) of E Coms notice of such Third-Party Claim. If the
Shareholder Representative is not entitled or elects not to assume
the defense of the Third-Party Claim or fails to notify E Com of its election
as herein provided, E Com shall have the right to conduct such defense with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Shareholder Representative, but E Com (or
any insurance carrier defending such Third-Party Claim on E Coms behalf)
shall be prohibited from compromising or settling the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) Subject to _Section 8.3(b)(iv)_, should the Shareholder Representative so
elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, as long as the
Shareholder Representative conducts such defense, E Com shall not be entitled
to indemnification under this _Article 8_ for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by E Com in connection with the defense thereof. If the Shareholder
Representative assumes such defense, E Com shall have the right to participate
in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate
from the counsel employed by the Shareholder Representative, it being
understood that the Shareholder Representative shall control such defense. E
Com shall be entitled to indemnification under this _Article 8_ for the fees
and expenses of counsel employed by E Com for any period during which
the Shareholder Representative has not assumed the defense thereof (other
than during any period in which E Com shall have not yet given notice of the
Third-Party Claim as provided above). If the Shareholder Representative
chooses to defend or prosecute any Third-Party Claim, the Shareholder
Representative and E Com shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Shareholder Representatives request) the provision to the Shareholder
Representative of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such
Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Whether or not the Shareholder Representative shall have
assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, E Com shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-
Party Claim without the Shareholder Representatives prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if a settlement offer is made by a third-party claimant solely
for money damages and does not seek equitable or other relief and the
settlement is not likely to establish a precedential custom or practice
adverse to the continued business interests of E Com, and the Shareholder
Representative notifies in writing E Com of the Shareholder
Representatives willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject to
the applicable limitations of this _Article 8_ , cause to be paid the amount
called for by such offer, and E Com declines to accept such offer, E Com may
continue to contest such Third-Party Claim, free of any participation by the
Shareholder Representative, and the amount of any ultimate liability with
respect to such Third-Party Claim for which E Com shall be entitled to

THE WARRANT REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON

MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER
SUCH ACT OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT
AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT IS AVAILABLE. THE TRANSFER OF
THE WARRANT IS FURTHER RESTRICTED AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.

E COM VENTURES, INC.

Common Stock Purchase Warrant



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  No. A-[*] |  | [*] Shares 
 

Date of Issuance: [*], 2008

This Common Stock Purchase Warrant (this "Warrant") certifies that, for value
received, [*] (the "Holder"), is entitled, upon the terms and subject to the
limitations and exceptions set forth herein, at any time and from time to
time during the period beginning at 12:01 a.m. New York time on the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Date of Issuance (the "Initial Exercise Date") and
ending at 5:00 p.m. New York time on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Date
of Issuance (the "Termination Date"), to subscribe for and purchase from E
Com Ventures, Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Company"), up to an aggregate
of [*] ([*]) shares (subject to adjustment from time to time pursuant to the
terms hereof) (the "Warrant Shares") of the Companys Common Stock, $0.01 par
value (the "Common Stock"). The purchase price of one Warrant Share (the
"Exercise Price") under this Warrant shall be $23.94 (subject to adjustment
from time to time pursuant to the terms hereof). This Warrant is one of a
series of warrants issued as of the date hereof (the "Warrants") pursuant to
the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 21, 2007, by and among
the Company, Model Reorg, Inc., the stockholders of Model Reorg, Inc. and
Model Reorg Acquisition LLC (the "Merger Agreement").

1\. _Exercise of Warrant_.

(a) The purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised by
delivery of the Notice of Exercise Form annexed hereto duly executed, at the
office of the Company specified in Section 13(j) hereto and upon payment of
the Exercise Price of the shares thereby purchased by wire transfer or
cashiers check drawn on a United States bank. Promptly after the Date of
Exercise, subject to (i) compliance with securities laws applicable to the
issuance and sale of the Warrant Shares and (ii) the Companys receipt of this
Warrant, the Companys transfer agent shall transmit certificates for Warrant
Shares purchased hereunder to the Holder at the address specified in the
Notice of Exercise Form. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised
and the Holder shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of such
shares for all purposes as of the Date of Exercise, notwithstanding that the
transfer books of the Company shall then be closed or certificates
representing such Warrant Shares shall not then have been actually delivered.
A "Date of Exercise" means the date on which the Holder shall have delivered
to the Company the Notice of Exercise Form appropriately completed and duly
signed and payment of the Exercise Price for the number of Warrant Shares so
indicated by the Holder to be purchased.  (b) If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall,
promptly following receipt of this Warrant, deliver to the Holder at the
address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise Form a new Warrant
evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares
called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be
identical with this Warrant.

2\. _No Fractional Shares or Scrip_. No fractional shares or scrip
representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this
Warrant. In lieu of any fraction of a share that the Holder would otherwise be
entitled to purchase upon such exercise, such fraction shall be rounded up
(for fractions of one-half or greater) or down (for fractions of less than
one-half) to the nearest whole share.

3\. _Charges, Taxes and Expenses_. Certificates for Warrant Shares shall be
issued without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or other
incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such certificate, all of
which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company.

4\. _Restriction on Transfer of Warrant and Warrant Shares_. The Holder may
not sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of this Warrant or any part
hereof except (a) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or (b)
during the Holders lifetime, to any member of the Holders family or to any
trust or other entity established for estate planning purposes, the majority
of the beneficial interests in which are held by members of the Holders
family. Other than pursuant to clause (a) or (b), the Holder (including any
such subsequent Holder) may not sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose
of this Warrant or any part hereof to any other person without the prior,
express written consent of the Company. The transfer of the Warrant Shares
shall be restricted to the extent required by applicable securities laws, and
the certificate or certificates evidencing the Warrant Shares shall bear the
following legend:

"THE ISSUANCE OF THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAS NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND SUCH SHARES MAY NOT BE
OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER SUCH ACT OR
AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT AN EXEMPTION
FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT IS AVAILABLE."

5\. _No Rights as Shareholder until Exercise_. This Warrant does not entitle
the Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a shareholder of the
Company before the exercise hereof.

6\. _Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant_. Upon receipt by the
Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate
representing Warrant Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of
indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of
the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender
and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate, if mutilated, the
Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of
like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or
stock certificate.

7.  _Acceleration of Initial Exercise Date_. At any time before the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Date of Issuance, the Initial Exercise Date shall be
accelerated and shall be deemed to occur immediately before the consummation
of any (a) merger, share exchange or  



 

2  consolidation of the Company with or into any other person or entity, (b)
sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets in one or a series
of related transactions, or (c) tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to
which holders of not less than ninety percent (90%) of the then outstanding
shares of Common Stock tender or exchange their shares for other securities,
cash or property, other than any such transaction as a result of which
holders of a majority of the voting securities of the Company outstanding
immediately before such transaction would continue to have beneficial
ownership, directly or indirectly, of a majority of the combined voting power
of the Company or the surviving entity (including any person that, as a result
of such transaction, owns all or substantially all of the Companys assets
either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) outstanding immediately
after such transaction.

8\. _Adjustments of Exercise Price and Number of Warrant Shares_. The number
and kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant and the
Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time. In case the
Company shall (i) pay a dividend in shares of Common Stock or make a
distribution in shares of Common Stock to holders of its outstanding Common
Stock, (ii) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater
number of shares, (iii) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
smaller number of shares of Common Stock, or (iv) issue any shares of its
capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock or a compulsory share
exchange, then the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of this
Warrant immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the Holder shall
be entitled to receive the kind and number of Warrant Shares or other
securities of the Company that he or she would have owned or have been
entitled to receive had such Warrant been exercised in advance thereof. Upon
each such adjustment of the kind and number of Warrant Shares or other
securities of the Company that are purchasable hereunder, the Holder shall
thereafter be entitled to purchase the number of Warrant Shares or other
securities resulting from such adjustment at an Exercise Price per Warrant
Share or other security obtained by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect
immediately before such adjustment by the number of Warrant Shares purchasable
hereunder immediately before such adjustment, and dividing such product by
the number of Warrant Shares or other securities of the Company resulting from
such adjustment. An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall become
effective immediately after the effective date of such event retroactive to
the record date, if any, for such event, subject to the effect of any exercise
hereof between such record date and such effective date.

9.  _Fundamental Transactions_. If, at any time while this Warrant is
outstanding, (a) the Company effects any merger, share exchange or
consolidation of the Company with or into any other person or entity, (b) the
Company effects any sale of all or substantially all of its assets in one or
a series of related transactions, (c) any tender offer or exchange offer
(whether by the Company or another person or entity) is completed pursuant to
which holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or exchange their
shares for other securities, cash or property, or (d) the Company effects any
reclassification of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant
to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for
securities of any other issuer, cash or property (in any such case, a
"Fundamental Transaction"), then the Holder shall have the right thereafter to
receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same amount and kind of
securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon
the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately
before such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant
Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant (the "Alternate
Consideration"). For purposes of any such exercise, the  



 

3  determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply
to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate
Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such
Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price
among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the
relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If
holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or
property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be
given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any
exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent
necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Company
or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall issue to the Holder
a new warrant consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the
Holders right to exercise such warrant into Alternate Consideration; provided
that this Warrant shall have been cancelled or amended to the extent
such cancellation or amendment is necessary so that such new warrant does not
unjustly or disproportionately enrich the holder of the new warrant relative
to a holder of the number of Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable
immediately before such event. The terms of any agreement pursuant to which a
Fundamental Transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any such
successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this Section 9
and ensuring that this Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be
similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transaction analogous to a Fundamental
Transaction.

10\. _Notice of Adjustment_. Whenever the number of Warrant Shares or number
or kind of securities or other property purchasable upon the exercise of this
Warrant or the Exercise Price is adjusted, as herein provided, the Company
shall promptly give notice thereof to the Holder, which notice shall state
the number of Warrant Shares (and other securities or property) purchasable
upon the exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price of such Warrant
Shares (and other securities or property) after such adjustment, setting
forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting
forth the computation by which such adjustment was made. Irrespective of any
adjustments in the Exercise Price or the number or kind of shares
purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant, Warrants theretofore or
thereafter issued may continue to express the same price and number and kind
of shares as are stated in this Warrant.

11\. _Notice of Corporate Action_. If at any time: (a) the Company shall take
a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them
to receive a dividend or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for or
purchase any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of stock of any class
or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or (b)
there shall be any capital reorganization of the Company,
any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock of the Company,
or any consolidation, share exchange or merger of the Company with, or any
sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the property,
assets or business of the Company to, another person or entity, or (c) there
shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
the Company, the Company shall give the Holder (i) at least ten (10) days
prior written notice of the date on which a record date shall be selected for
such dividend, distribution or right or for determining rights to vote in
respect of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, share exchange,
consolidation, sale, transfer, disposition, liquidation or winding up, and
(ii) in the case of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, share
exchange, consolidation, sale, transfer, disposition, dissolution, liquidation
or winding up, at least ten (10) days prior written notice of the date when
the same shall take place. Such  



 

4  notice in accordance with the foregoing clause also shall specify (i) the
date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution or right, the date on which the holders of Common
Stock shall be entitled to any such dividend, distribution or right, and the
amount and character thereof, and (ii) the date on which any such
reorganization, reclassification, merger, share exchange, consolidation,
sale, transfer, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take
place and the time, if any such time is to be fixed, as of which the holders
of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange their shares for securities or
other property deliverable upon such disposition, dissolution, liquidation or
winding up.

12\. _Covenants_. The Company covenants that:

(a) during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its
authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide
for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise hereof;

(b) its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority to its
officers who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to
execute and issue the necessary certificates for the Warrant Shares upon the
exercise hereof;

(c) it will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that
such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any
applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Principal Market
(as defined in Section 13(k)) upon which the Common Stock may be listed at
such time;

(d) it will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner that
prevents the timely exercise of this Warrant pursuant to the terms hereof; 

(e) all Warrant Shares that may be issued upon exercise hereof will, upon such
exercise, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and free from all taxes, liens and charges in respect of the issue thereof;

(f) except as and to the extent waived or consented to by the Holder, the
Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending its
articles of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any
of the terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in
the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as
may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth
in this Warrant against impairment (and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant
Shares above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately
before such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be
necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally
issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this
Warrant, and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such
authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having
jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary to enable the Company to perform its
obligations under this Warrant); and



 

5 (g) before taking any action that would result in an adjustment in the number
of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the Exercise
Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof,
or consents thereto, as may be necessary from any public regulatory body or
bodies having jurisdiction thereof.

 

13\. _Miscellaneous_.

(a) _Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc_. If the last or appointed day for the
taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein
(including without limitation the Termination Date) is not a Business Day,
then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next
succeeding Business Day. As used in this Warrant, a "Business Day" is any day
that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or a legal holiday in the States of New York
or Florida.

(b) _Governing Law; Dispute Resolution_. All questions concerning the
construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant
shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdictions) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of New
York. The dispute resolution provisions of the Merger Agreement shall apply to
all disputes arising hereunder as if set forth in full herein. EACH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A
JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS WARRANT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

(c) _Nonwaiver_. No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any
right hereunder on the part of the Holder shall operate as a waiver of such
right or otherwise prejudice the Holders rights, powers or remedies.

(d) _Limitation of Liability_. No provision hereof, in the absence of any
affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant or purchase Warrant
Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder,
shall give rise to any liability of the Holder for the purchase price of any
Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is
asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company.

(e)  _Remedies_. The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all
rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to
specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that
monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by
reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees
to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at
law would be adequate.

 

(f) _Successors and Assigns_. Subject to applicable securities laws, this
Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the successors of the Company and the
successors and permitted assigns of the Holder. The provisions of this Warrant
are intended to be for the benefit of all Holders from time to time of this
Warrant and shall be enforceable by any such Holder or holder of Warrant
Shares.



 

6 (g) _Amendment_. This Warrant may be modified or amended or any provision
hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and the holders of
Warrants issued under the Merger Agreement representing two-thirds of the
Warrant Shares issuable under Warrants then outstanding as of the date such
consent is sought; provided, however, that (i) no such amendment shall
adversely affect any holder of any such Warrant differently than it affects
all other such holders unless such holder consents thereto and (ii) no
amendment may increase the Exercise Price, decrease the number of shares or
class of shares obtainable upon exercise of this Warrant or decrease the time
period in which this Warrant can be exercised without the written consent of
the Holder.

(h) _Severability_. Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provisions or the remaining provisions of this Warrant.

(i) _Headings_. The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of
reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of this
Warrant.

(j) _Notices_. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries
hereunder (including without limitation any Notice of Exercise Form) shall be
in writing and shall be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (i) the
date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered
via electronic mail or facsimile at the electronic mail address or facsimile

2\. _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_. The Company covenants and agrees as follows:

2.1 _Company Registration_. Promptly after the Company determines to register
(including, for this purpose, a registration by the Company for holders of
Common Stock other than the Shareholders) any of its securities under the
Securities Act in connection with the public offering of such securities
solely for cash (other than in an Excluded Registration), the Company shall
give each Shareholder written notice of such proposed registration. Upon the
request of any Shareholder given within twenty (20) days after such notice,
the Company shall, subject to the provisions of Section 2.2, cause to be
registered all of the Registrable Securities that each such Shareholder has
requested to be included in such registration.

2.2 _Underwriting Requirements_.

 

(a) If the Shareholders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities
covered by their registration request by means of an underwriting, they
shall so advise the Company and will select (by a Majority in Interest) such
underwriter(s) as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. In such
event, the right of any Shareholder to include such Shareholders Registrable
Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Shareholders
participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Shareholders
Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All
Shareholders proposing to distribute their securities through such
underwriting shall (together with the Company as provided in Section 2.3(e))
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter(s)
selected for such underwriting.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.2, if the
underwriter(s) referred to in clause (a) advise(s) such Shareholders
in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of
shares to be underwritten, the maximum number of Registrable Securities and
securities to be registered on behalf of all Participating Holders that may be
included in the underwriting shall be allocated among such Shareholders and
Participating Holders in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the number
of Registrable Securities for which each Shareholder and Participating Holder
requested registration; provided, however, that the number of Registrable
Securities held by the Shareholders to be included in such underwriting shall
not be reduced unless all other securities (other than securities to be sold
by the Company and Participating Holders) are first entirely excluded from
the underwriting.



 

\- 3 - (c) For purposes of any apportionment under Section 2.2(b), a Shareholder and
any of such Shareholders transferees shall be deemed to be a single
"Shareholder," and any pro rata reduction with respect to such "Shareholder"
shall be based upon the aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned by
all Persons included in such "Shareholder," as defined in this sentence.

2.3 _Obligations of the Company_. Whenever required under this Section 2 to
effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as
expeditiously as reasonably possible:

(a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to
such Registrable Securities and use its best efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective and, upon the request of a Majority
in Interest, keep such registration statement effective for a period of up to
one hundred twenty (120) days or, if earlier, until the distribution
contemplated in the registration statement has been completed; provided,
however, that (i) such 120-day period shall be extended for a period of time
equal to the period the Shareholders refrain, at the written request of an
underwriter of Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company, from selling
any securities included in such registration and (ii) in the case of any
registration of Registrable Securities that are intended to be offered on a
continuous or delayed basis, such 120-day period shall be extended for up to
an additional sixty (60) days, if necessary, to keep the registration
statement effective until all such Registrable Securities are sold;

(b) subject to clause (i), prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to such registration statement, and the prospectus used in
connection with such registration statement, as may be necessary to keep such
registration statement effective for the period specified in clause (a)
and to comply with the Securities Act in order to enable the disposition of
all securities covered by such registration statement;

(c) furnish to the selling Shareholders such numbers of copies of the
prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, included in the registration
statement, and such other documents, as the Shareholders may reasonably
request in order to facilitate their disposition of their Registrable
Securities;

(d) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register and qualify the
securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities
or blue-sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the
selling Shareholders; provided that the Company shall not be required to
qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in
any such states or jurisdictions unless the Company is already subject to
service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities
Act;

(e) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform
its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form,
with the underwriter(s) of such offering;

(f) promptly make available (subject to reasonable confidentiality
requirements) for inspection by the selling Shareholders, any underwriter(s)
participating in any disposition pursuant to such registration statement, and
any attorney or accountant or other agent retained by any such underwriter or
selected by the selling Shareholders, all financial and other records,  



 

\- 4 -  pertinent corporate documents, and properties of the Company, and cause the
Companys officers, directors, employees, and independent accountants
to supply all information reasonably requested by any such seller,
underwriter, attorney, accountant, or agent, in each case, as necessary or
reasonably advisable to verify the accuracy of the information in such
registration statement and to conduct appropriate due diligence in connection
therewith;

(g) notify each selling Shareholder, promptly after the Company receives
notice thereof, of the time when such registration statement has been
declared effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such
registration statement has been filed;

(h) after such registration statement becomes effective, notify each selling
Shareholder of any request by the SEC that the Company amend or
supplement such registration statement or prospectus; and

(i) immediately notify each seller of Registrable Securities and each
underwriter under such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the
happening of any event of which the Company has knowledge as a result of which
the prospectus contained in such registration statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing, and, at the
request of a Majority in Interest, the Company shall promptly prepare a
supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to
the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall
not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
provided that the Company may postpone for up to ninety (90) days the delivery
of any such supplement or amendment if the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith that disclosure of the new information to be
contained therein would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on (i) any proposal or plan by the Company or any of its affiliates to
engage in any acquisition of assets (other than in the ordinary course of
business) or any merger, consolidation, tender offer, reorganization or
similar transaction or (ii) any pending or threatened litigation to which the
Company is, or is threatened to be made, a party; and

(j) in the case of an underwritten offering, use its best efforts to furnish,
at the request of any Shareholder whose Registrable Securities are included in
the registration statement, on the date on which such Registrable Securities
are sold to the underwriter, (i) an opinion, dated such date, of the
counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, in
form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten
public offering, addressed to the underwriters and such Shareholder and (ii) a
"comfort" letter dated such date, from the independent certified public
accountants of the Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by
independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten
public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any.

2.4 _Furnish Information_. It shall be a condition precedent to the
obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to this Section 2 with
respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Shareholder that such
Shareholder shall furnish to the Company  



 

\- 5 -  such information regarding such Shareholder, the Registrable Securities held
by such Shareholder, and the intended method of disposition of such
securities as is reasonably required to effect the registration of such
Shareholders Registrable Securities.

2.5 _Expenses of Registration_. All expenses (other than Selling Expenses)
incurred in connection with registrations, filings, or qualifications pursuant
to this Section 2, including all registration, filing, and qualification fees,
printers and accounting fees, and fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Company, shall be borne and paid by the Company, whether or not any such
registration or qualification becomes effective. All Selling Expenses relating
to Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Section 2 shall be
borne and paid by the Shareholders pro rata on the basis of the number of
Registrable Securities registered on their behalf.

2.6 _Withdrawal of Registration_. The Company shall have the right to
terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it before the
effective date thereof, whether or not any Shareholder has elected to include
Registrable Securities in such registration, without liability of the Company
to any holder of Registrable Securities except for payment of registration
expenses as provided in Section 2.5. Any Shareholder may withdraw any
Registrable Securities from any registration before the effective date of such
registration without liability to the Company or any other holder of Common
Stock except for payment of such Shareholders portion of any Selling
Expenses incurred with respect to the period before such withdrawal.

2.7 _Indemnification_. If any Registrable Securities are included in a
registration statement under this Section 2:

(a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold
harmless each selling Shareholder, and the partners, members, officers,
directors, and shareholders of each such Shareholder, legal counsel for each
such Shareholder, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for each
such Shareholder, and each Person, if any, who controls such Shareholder,
underwriter or other Person within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, against any Damages, and the Company will pay to each such
Shareholder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person
any legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection
with investigating or defending any claim or proceeding from which Damages may
result, as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity
agreement contained in this Section 2.7(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such claim or proceeding if such settlement is effected
without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, nor shall the Company be liable for any Damages to the extent that
they arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of any
such Shareholder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned
Person expressly for use in connection with such registration.

(b) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Shareholder, severally and
not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and each of its
directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement,
each Person (if any), who controls the Company within the meaning of the
Securities Act, legal counsel for the Company, any underwriter (as defined in
 



 

\- 6 -  the Securities Act), any other Shareholder selling securities in such
registration statement, and any controlling Person of any such underwriter,
other Shareholder or other Person, against any Damages, in each case only to
the extent that such Damages arise out of or are based upon actions or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished by or on behalf of such selling Shareholder expressly for use in
connection with such registration; and each such selling Shareholder will pay
to the Company and each other aforementioned Person any legal fees and other
expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating or
defending any claim or proceeding from which Damages may result, as such
expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement
contained in this Section 2.7(b) shall not apply to amounts paid
in settlement of any such claim or proceeding if such settlement is effected
without the consent of the Shareholder, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; and provided further that in no event shall the
aggregate amounts payable by any Shareholder by way of indemnity or
contribution under Sections 2.7(b) and 2.7(d) exceed the proceeds from the
offering received by such Shareholder (net of any Selling Expenses paid by
such Shareholder).

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.7 of
notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action)
for which a party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against
any indemnifying party under this Section 2.7, give the indemnifying party
notice of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall have the
right to participate in such action and, to the extent the indemnifying party
so desires, participate jointly with any other indemnifying party to which
notice has been given, and to assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an
indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be
represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain
one separate counsel, with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the
indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel
retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual
or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other
party represented by such counsel in such action. The failure to give notice
to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any
such action will not relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the
indemnified party under this Section 2.7, except to the extent, and only to
the extent, that such failure actually and materially prejudices the
indemnifying partys ability to defend such action. The failure to give
notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it
may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 2.7.

(d) To provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under
the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) any party
otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder makes a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 2.7 but it is judicially determined
(by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent
jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last
right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case,
notwithstanding the fact that this Section 2.7 provides for indemnification in
such case or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on
the part of any party hereto for which indemnification is provided under this
Section 2.7, then, and in each such case, such parties will contribute to the
aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses to which they may
be subject (after contribution from  



 

\- 7 -  others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault
of each of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with
the statements, omissions, or other actions that resulted in such loss,
claim, damage, liability, or expense, as well as to reflect any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of
the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact,
or the omission or alleged omission of a material fact, relates to information
supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however, that, in any
such case, no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation; and provided further that in no event shall the aggregate
amounts payable by any Shareholder by way of indemnity or contribution under
Sections 2.7(b) and 2.7(d) exceed the proceeds from the offering received by
such Shareholder (net of any Selling Expenses) paid by such Shareholder).

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any provision on
indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement
entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering is in
conflict with any of the foregoing provisions, the provision in the
underwriting agreement shall control.

(f) The obligations of the Company and Shareholders under this Section 2.7
shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a
registration under this Section 2, and otherwise shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

2.8 _Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights_. The Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities then outstanding, enter into any agreement that would
(x) allow any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company to
include such securities in any registration under the Securities Act or (y)
require the Company to comply with any demand or request by or on behalf of
such holder or prospective holder for registration of any securities held by
or on behalf of such holder or prospective holder unless (a) such holder or
prospective holder is (i) an institutional investor or financial institution
that, with the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company, has provided
bona fide debt or equity financing to the Company and/or (ii) a holder of
Company securities issued with the approval of the Board of Directors of the
Company as consideration for the acquisition of a business or assets, and such
agreement is entered into as a condition of such financing or acquisition and
(b) the terms of such agreement allow the Company to comply with Section 2.1
hereof and require such holder or prospective holder to (i) comply with the
underwriting requirements in Section 2.2(a) hereof together with the
Shareholders and (ii) include such securities in any such registration only
pro rata with the Registrable Securities in compliance with Section 2.2(b)
hereof. The Company represents and warrants that no such rights exist as of
the date of this Agreement, except as pursuant to this Agreement.

2.9 _Termination of Registration Rights_. The right of any Shareholder to
request inclusion of Registrable Securities in any registration pursuant to
Section 2.1 shall terminate on the date that such Shareholder is able to sell,
during any three-month period without limitation under Rule 144 of the amount
of securities to be sold, all of the remaining Registrable Securities held by
or then issuable to such Shareholder.



 

\- 8 - 3\. _MISCELLANEOUS_.
