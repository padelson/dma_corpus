order to offset the mutual credits existing between them and with the spouses R&eacute;cher Hern&aacute;n Vivanco C&oacute;rdova and Luz Aminta Sierra Sierra de Vivanco, the
latter expressly agreed to offset credits in the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS, which price is deducted from the total price of this assignment and transfer of shares. For this reason,
when THE BUYER, in turn, assigns and transfers the shares hereunder to the spouses R&eacute;cher Hern&aacute;n Vivanco C&oacute;rdova and Luz Aminta Sierra Sierra de Vivanco,
THE BUYER must, also in said instrument, deduct from the total price of said sale the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND 00/100 (US$100,000) US DOLLARS. Such being the case, the pending balance of the

parties expressly agree that, without prejudice to the above provisions concerning the price, set forth in this clause, if THE BUYER pays to THE SELLERS or to the party designated by them the amount
