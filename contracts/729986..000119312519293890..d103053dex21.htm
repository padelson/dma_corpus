AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of November
17, 2019, is entered into by and between United Bankshares, Inc., a West
Virginia corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and Carolina Financial Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (" _CFC_ "). Each of Buyer and CFC is referred to herein
as a " _Party_ " and, together, as the " _Parties_."

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Buyer and CFC (the " _Buyer Board_ " and
the " _CFC Board_ ," respectively) have determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective companies and their Stockholders to consummate
the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement
in which CFC will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, merge with and into Buyer (the " _Merger_ "), so that Buyer is
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such
capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ");

WHEREAS, the Buyer Board and the CFC Board have each adopted this Agreement,
duly authorized the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and
resolved to recommend that the stockholders of each of Buyer and CFC approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each member of the
CFC Board is entering into a voting and support agreement substantially in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each, a " _Support Agreement_ ");

 

WHEREAS, it is intended that, following the Merger, CresCom Bank, a South
Carolina banking corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of CFC (" _CresCom
Bank_ "), will be merged with and into United Bank, a Virginia state-chartered
bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _Buyer Bank_ "), so that Buyer
Bank is the surviving bank (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "
_Surviving Bank_ ");

WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and including the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "); and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and to prescribe certain conditions
precedent to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties, and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as
follows:

 



1

    

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The_ _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the WVBCA, at the Effective Time, CFC shall merge with and
into Buyer. Buyer shall be the surviving entity in the Merger and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of West Virginia.
As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of CFC shall
cease.

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective on the date and at the
time for effectiveness set forth in the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective
Time_ ") accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of the State of West
Virginia (the " _Articles of Merger_ ").

 

1.3 _Effects of the_ _Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the relevant
provisions of the WVBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers, and franchises of CFC shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, and duties of CFC shall become the debts, liabilities,
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.4 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of Buyer, CFC, or the holder of any of
the following securities:

(a) Each share of Common Stock, $2.50 par value per share, of Buyer (the "
_Buyer Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

 

(b) All shares of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of CFC (the " _CFC
Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are owned, directly or indirectly, by CFC or Buyer (other than Trust
Account Shares and other than shares of CFC Common Stock held as a result of
debts previously contracted) shall no longer be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled, and shall cease to exist, and no Buyer Common
Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.4(e)_, each share of CFC Common Stock, except
for shares of CFC Common Stock owned by Buyer, CFC, or any of their
respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and
shares of CFC Common Stock held as a result of debts previously contracted),
shall be converted into the right to receive 1.13 shares (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") of validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable shares of Buyer
Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(d) All of the shares of CFC Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _Article I_ shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled, and shall cease to exist as of
the Effective Time, and each book entry notation of record ownership and each
certificate previously representing any such shares of CFC Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of CFC Common Stock represented by such book entry notation
of record ownership or such certificate have been converted pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 1.4_, as well as any

 



2

    

 dividends to which holders of CFC Common Stock become entitled in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

 

(e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is
declared (with an effective time prior to the Effective Time) or effected a
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), split-up, stock dividend or stock distribution
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Buyer
Common Stock or CFC Common Stock), combination, exchange, or readjustment of
shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Buyer Common Stock or
CFC Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted
accordingly to provide to the holders of CFC Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.4(e)_, no adjustment shall be
made in the event of the issuance of additional shares of Buyer Common Stock
or CFC Common Stock pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plan or direct
investment plan of Buyer or CFC, as applicable, pursuant to the exercise of
stock options awarded under any director, employee or affiliate stock option
plans of Buyer or CFC, as applicable, or their Subsidiaries, or upon the grant
or sale of shares or rights to receive shares to or for the account of any
director, employee, or Affiliate of Buyer or CFC, as applicable, or any of
their Subsidiaries pursuant to any stock option or other compensation or
benefit plans of Buyer or CFC, as applicable, or in connection with
the issuance of shares as consideration in a transaction where Buyer or CFC,
as applicable, is the surviving corporation or in connection with any offering
of shares where Buyer or CFC, as applicable, receives consideration in
exchange for the shares so offered.

1.5 _Stock Options and Other Stock Awards_

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, at each optionholders election, each
outstanding option to purchase a share or shares of CFC Common Stock (each, a
" _CFC Option_ ") shall be (i) entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to
the product obtained by _multiplying_ (1) the difference between (a) the CFC
Closing Price and (b) the exercise price (rounded to the nearest cent) for
each outstanding CFC Option by (2) the number of shares of CFC Common Stock
subject to such CFC Stock Option or (ii) assumed by Buyer substantially in
accordance with the terms of the agreement underlying each option, such that
after the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of such CFC
Option, such CFC Options shall be converted into and become stock options with
respect to Buyer Common Stock (each, a " _Surviving Corporation Stock Option_
"). As of the Effective Time, each holder of a CFC Option electing to receive
cash pursuant to subsection (i) above shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash consideration specified
in this _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)_, without interest. From and after the
Effective Time, for each CFC Option assumed by Buyer as a Surviving
Corporation Stock Option pursuant to subsection (ii): (A) such CFC Option may
be exercised solely for shares of Buyer Common Stock; (B) the number of shares
of Buyer Common Stock subject to such CFC Option shall be equal to the product
of (x) the total number of shares of CFC Common Stock subject to such CFC
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up or down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share
of Buyer Common Stock; and (C) the per-share exercise price under each such
CFC Option shall be adjusted to equal the quotient of (x) the exercise price
per share of such CFC Option at which such CFC Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (y) the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up or down to the nearest whole cent, if necessary. Any election by a
holder of a

 



3

    

 CFC Option to receive cash must be made at least five (5) days prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with the procedures implemented by Buyer and CFC
with respect to such election.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock grant, restricted stock unit
grant and any other award in respect of a share of CFC Common Stock subject
to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction under a CFC Stock Plan that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than a CFC Option
(each, a " _CFC Stock Award_ ") shall vest in accordance with the terms of
the CFC Stock Award (with any performance-vesting component relating to a CFC
Stock Award granted in January 2019 being deemed to have been satisfied in
full at the maximum level of performance), be cancelled and, at the election
of the holder thereof, (A) converted automatically into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of CFC Common Stock
underlying such CFC Stock Award or (B) entitled to receive cash in an
amount equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (1) the CFC Closing
Price by (2) the number of shares of CFC Common Stock underlying such CFC
Stock Award. The Surviving Corporation shall issue the consideration described
in this  _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_ less applicable tax withholdings within 5
Business Days following the Closing Date. As of the Effective Time, each
holder of a CFC Stock Award electing to receive cash pursuant to subsection
(B) above shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the cash consideration specified in this _Section_ __ _
1.5(b)_, without interest. Any election by a holder of a CFC Stock Award to
receive cash must be made at least five (5) days prior to the Effective Time
in accordance with the procedures implemented by Buyer and CFC with respect to
such election.

 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, if and to the

the holder of such CFC Stock Certificate or CFC Stock Certificates shall be

any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of CFC of the shares of CFC Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, CFC Stock Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, and dividends or
distributions that the holder presenting such CFC Stock Certificates is
entitled to, as provided in this  _Article II_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Buyer
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of CFC Stock Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Buyer Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a Stockholder of Buyer. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Buyer shall pay to each former Stockholder of CFC who otherwise would
be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded up to
the nearest cent), without any interest thereon, equal to the product of (i)
the Buyer Closing Price _multiplied by_ (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded
to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Buyer Common
Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.4_.

 

(f) Any former holders of CFC Common Stock who have not exchanged their CFC
Stock Certificates pursuant to this _Article II_ shall look only to the
Exchange Agent for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Buyer
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of CFC Common Stock
such Stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Buyer,
CFC, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any former holder of CFC Common Stock for any amount delivered
in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat, or similar laws.

 

(g) Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, or any other cash amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of CFC Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of CFC Common Stock in
respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Buyer or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(h) In the event any CFC Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such CFC Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by
such Person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent reasonably
determines as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such CFC Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in

 



8

    

 exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed CFC Stock Certificate the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect
thereof, and any dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such
CFC Stock Certificates is entitled to, each as provided pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CFC

 

Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.2(b)_ of this
Agreement and except as Previously Disclosed, CFC represents and warrants to
Buyer that:

3.1 _Authorization, No Conflicts, Etc_. 

(a) CFC has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, and, subject to receipt of the CFC Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has
been duly adopted, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized, by the
CFC Board. The CFC Board has (i) determined that the terms of this Agreement
are fair to and in the best interests of CFC and the CFC Stockholders, and
(ii) adopted this Agreement and authorized the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and resolved to make the CFC Board Recommendation. Except for
the CFC Stockholder Approval, no other corporate proceedings on the part of
CFC are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger
(other than the submission to the CFC Stockholders of an advisory (non-
binding) vote on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to CFCs
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by, and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Buyer) constitutes valid and binding obligations of, CFC and is
enforceable against CFC in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
that (A) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
relating to creditors rights generally and (B) equitable remedies of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding therefor may be brought.

(b) The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by CFC and the
consummation of the Merger, do not and will not violate, conflict with, or
result in a breach of: (i) any provision of the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of CFC or any Subsidiary of
CFC (each a " _CFC Subsidiary_ " and collectively, the " _CFC Subsidiaries_
"); or (ii) any Law or Order applicable to CFC or any CFC Subsidiary, assuming
the timely receipt of each of the approvals referred to in  _Section_ __ _
3.1(d)_.

(c) The execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by CFC and
the consummation of the Merger do not and will not violate, conflict with,
result in a breach of, constitute a default under, or require any consent,
approval, waiver, extension, amendment, authorization, notice, or filing
under, any cease and desist order, written agreement, memorandum of
understanding, board resolutions or other Regulatory Agreement or commitment
with or from a Governmental Entity to which CFC or any CFC Subsidiary is a
party or subject, or by which CFC or any CFC Subsidiary is bound or affected.

 



9

    

(d) No notice to, filing with, authorization of, exemption by, or consent
or approval of, any Governmental Entity is necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by CFC other than in
connection or compliance with the provisions of the DGCL, compliance with
federal and state securities laws, and the notices, consents, authorizations,
approvals, or exemptions required under the BHC Act and the South Carolina
Code of Laws. CFC has no Knowledge of any reason why the Regulatory Approvals
referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(d)_ cannot be obtained or why the
regulatory approval process would be materially impeded.

 

(e) Except for Section 203 of the DGCL, no "fair price," "moratorium,"

"business combination," or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
enacted under any federal, state, local, or foreign laws applicable to CFC
is applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Assuming that the representations of Buyer set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.29_ are true and correct, the CFC Board has
taken all actions so that the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the
DGCL applicable to a "business combination" (as defined in such Section 203)
will not apply to the execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

3.2 _Organization and Good Standing_. CFC is a corporation duly organized and
validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. CFC has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate,
and lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. CFC is a financial holding company duly registered as such
with the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act. CFC is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in the states of the United States where its
ownership or leasing of property or assets or the conduct of its business
requires it to be so qualified.

 

3.3 _Subsidiaries_

Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement. CFC or a CFC Subsidiary owns all

permitted by Law, and all premiums and assessments to be paid in connection
therewith have been paid when due. No proceeding for the revocation or
termination of such deposit

action, with respect to any CFC Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected
to subject CFC or any CFC Subsidiary to a material tax or penalty imposed by

purposes of Section 4975 of the Code that the taxable period of any such
transaction expired as of the date hereof. To the knowledge of CFC, there is

(f) The execution, delivery of, and performance by CFC or any CFC Subsidiary
(or by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries assumption of obligations of CFC or any CFC Subsidiaries that
exist immediately prior to the Effective Time) of its obligations under the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent event) will not (i) except as
disclosed on _Section_ __ _ 3.18(f)_ of the CFC Disclosure Schedule, result
in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,

obligation to fund benefits with respect to any current, former or retired
employees, officers, consultants, independent contractors, agents or
directors of CFC or any of the CFC Subsidiaries; (ii) result in the triggering
or imposition of any restrictions or limitations on the right of CFC or any of

Schedule, result in any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of

provided Buyer with true, correct and complete copies of Section 280G
calculations (whether final or not) with respect to any disqualified
individual in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Except
with respect to compensation paid to those individuals set forth on _Schedule
3.18(f)_ of the CFC Disclosure Schedule, neither CFC nor any CFC Subsidiary
maintains any compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements the
payments under which would not reasonably be expected to be deductible for
federal income tax purposes for calendar year 2019 as a result of the
limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued
thereunder. Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.18(f)_ of the CFC
Disclosure Schedule, neither CFC nor any CFC Subsidiary has any obligation to
pay any gross-up or reimbursement for taxes under Section 4999 of the Code
with respect to this or any prior transaction.

 

(g) CFC and the CFC Subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations imposed by
applicable Law and the terms of the applicable CFC Benefit Plan, without the

Subsidiaries have entered into or assumed any agreement or arrangement to,
and do not otherwise have any obligation to, indemnify or hold harmless any
Person (or to provide any gross-up or reimbursement of any penalty, interest
or taxes to any Person) for any material Liability that

 



22

    

 results from the failure to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Neither CFC nor any CFC
Subsidiary has made any agreement, taken any action, or omitted to take any
action that would reasonably be expected to subject CFC or any CFC Subsidiary
to any obligation to report any amount or withhold any amount as includable in
income and subject to tax, interest or any penalty by any service provider to
CFC or any CFC Subsidiary under Section 409A of the Code.

(i) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of CFC, threatened Action with
respect to any CFC Benefit Plans, other than ordinary and usual claims for
benefits by participants and beneficiaries.

 

(j) Since January 1, 2019, neither CFC nor any of the CFC Subsidiaries have
agreed or otherwise committed to, whether in writing or otherwise, adopt any
new plan, program, agreement or policy that would constitute a CFC Benefit

the compensation, benefits, or terms and conditions of employment or service
of any director, officer, employee, or consultant, except (i) as set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 3.18(j)_ of the CFC Disclosure Schedule; or (ii) as required
by applicable Law or any applicable CFC Benefit Plan.

Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, to the extent applicable. Additionally,
CFC and CFC Subsidiaries operate such CFC Benefit Plans without liability for
assessable payments under Code Sections 4980H(a) and (b). Neither CFC nor any
of the CFC Subsidiaries have any Liability in the nature of a retroactive rate
adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other material Liability arising
wholly or partially out of events occurring on or before the Closing with
respect to any CFC Benefit Plan.

 

(l) No stock options, stock appreciation rights or other grants of stock-based
awards by CFC or any CFC Subsidiaries were backdated, spring-loaded, or
granted at less than fair market value.

(m) As of the Effective Time, there are no supplemental executive retirement
plans (SERPs) or non-qualified deferred compensation plans between CFC or any
CFC Subsidiary and any of its current or former employees, that have assets
through a grantor trust or trusts of which CFC or any CFC Subsidiary is the
grantor within the meaning of subpart E, part I, subchapter J, chapter 1,
subtitle A of the Code that are subject to claims of creditors of CFC or any
CFC Subsidiary, and no obligation of CFC or any CFC Subsidiary existing
before the Effective Time requires any such grantor trusts to be established
on or after the Effective Time as a result, directly or indirectly, of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
as a result of any termination of employment prior to or following the
Effective Time).

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) The Parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals, and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the
terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental Entities
(collectively, the " _Regulatory Approvals_ "). As soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement (but in no event more than 75 days after the date
hereof), Buyer shall prepare and file with the Federal Reserve Board and each
other Governmental Entity having jurisdiction all applications and documents
required to obtain the Regulatory Approvals (excluding the Regulatory
Approvals applicable solely to the Bank Merger), and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain each necessary approval of or consent to consummate the
Merger. Buyer shall

 



47

    

 provide CFC with reasonable opportunities to review and comment upon such
documents before filing and to make such amendments and file such supplements
thereto as CFC may reasonably request. Buyer shall provide CFC with copies of
all material correspondence received from such Governmental Entities and all
material responsive correspondence sent thereto. Buyer and CFC shall have the
right to review in advance, and each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all
other information relating to Buyer or CFC, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with,
or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the Parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. Each Party shall consult with the other in
advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other Party and its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences. The Parties shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals, and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party
will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Buyer, CFC, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to take any action, or commit to take any
action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals, and authorizations of
third parties or Governmental Entities, that the Buyer Board reasonably
determines in good faith would have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) after
giving effect to the Merger (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_
").

 

(b) Each of Buyer and CFC shall, upon request, furnish to the other all
information concerning itself and its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, and
stockholders, and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the applications necessary to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4, or
any other statement, filing, notice, or application made by or on behalf of
Buyer, CFC, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) Each of Buyer and CFC shall promptly advise the other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity, the consent or approval of
which is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed or subject to a
Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer or CFC, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other Party
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to _Article
V_ , as applicable, Buyer and CFC each shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
their respective business operations.

 



48

    

(e) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each
Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of any pending or, to
the Knowledge of either Party (as the case may be), threatened Action or Order
by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (a) challenging or seeking
material damages in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (b) seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If any Action or Order is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Law, each Party shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist, except insofar as the Parties may otherwise agree, any such Action or
Order, including any Action or Order that seeks a temporary restraining order
or preliminary injunction that would prohibit, prevent or
restrict consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
confidentiality of information, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
advisors, agents, and other Representatives of the other Party reasonable
access, during normal business hours throughout the period before the
Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and
records, and, during such period, such Party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other Party (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement, and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state banking or insurance laws (other than reports or documents
that such Party is not permitted to disclose under applicable Law) and (ii)
all other information concerning its business, properties, and personnel as
the other Party may reasonably request. Neither Party, nor any of its
Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such Party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty, or binding
agreement entered into before the date of this Agreement. The Parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) Each Party shall, and shall cause its respective agents and
Representatives to, maintain in confidence all information received from the
other Party (other than disclosure to that Partys agents and Representatives
in connection with the evaluation and consummation of the Merger) in
connection with this Agreement or the Merger pursuant to the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement and use such information solely to evaluate the
Merger; _provided that_ , the disclosure of such information shall be
permitted if (i) the receiving Party has determined in good faith that the use
of such information is necessary or appropriate in making any filing or
obtaining any consent required for the Merger (in which case the receiving
Party shall advise the other Party before making the disclosure) or (ii) the
receiving Party has determined in good faith that the furnishing or use of
such information is required by or necessary or appropriate in connection with
any applicable laws or any listing or trading requirement concerning its
publicly traded securities (in which case the receiving Party shall advise
the other Party before making the disclosure).

 



49

    

(c) No investigation by a Party or its agents or Representatives shall affect
or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the
other Party set forth in this Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

6.3 _Preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration
Statement; Stockholders_ __ _Meetings_

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in no event more than 75 days
following the date of this Agreement, Buyer and CFC shall use reasonable best
efforts to: (i) jointly prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a joint
proxy statement/prospectus to be sent to the Buyer Stockholders and the CFC
Stockholders relating to the Buyer Stockholder Meeting and the CFC
Stockholder Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the
" _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") and (ii) jointly prepare, and Buyer
shall cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Form S-4_"), in
which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included, and Buyer and
CFC shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing and use all reasonable best efforts to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger. Prior to
the filing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4, each of
Buyer and CFC shall consult with the other Party with respect to such filings
and shall afford the other Party and its Representatives reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon. Each of Buyer and CFC shall furnish all
information concerning itself and its Affiliates to the other and provide such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing, and distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and the Form S-4, and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4
shall include all information reasonably requested by each Party to be
included. Each of CFC and Buyer agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates, as applicable, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form
S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto,
if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement
thereto will, at the date of mailing to stockholders and at the time of
the CFC Stockholder Meeting and the Buyer Stockholder Meeting, as the case
may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or any statement which, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statement is made, will be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or which will omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or
misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier statement in
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
Each of CFC and Buyer further agrees that if it shall become aware prior to
the date of the CFC Stockholder Meeting or Buyer Stockholder Meeting, as the
case may be, of any information furnished by it that would cause any of the
statements in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be false or misleading
with 

 



50

    

 respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly
inform the other party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

(b) Each of CFC and Buyer shall promptly provide to the other copies of all
correspondence between it or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand, related to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4. Each of CFC and Buyer shall promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form
S-4 and shall provide the other with copies of all such SEC comments or
requests. Each of CFC and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to and resolve any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto, each of CFC and Buyer (i) shall provide the other an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response), (ii) shall include in
such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the other and
(iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior
to receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each of CFC and Buyer shall
advise the other, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the registration or qualification of the Merger
Consideration for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of CFC and
Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

(c) CFC shall, as soon as practicable following the effective date of the
Form S-4, duly call, give proper notice of, convene, and hold a meeting of the
CFC Stockholders (the " _CFC Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of (i)
obtaining the approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of CFC Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the " _CFC
Stockholder Approval_ "); and (ii) submitting a proposal to the CFC
Stockholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation
that may be paid or become payable to CFCs named executive officers that
is based on or otherwise related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. CFC shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the CFC Stockholders and to hold the CFC
Stockholder Meeting as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act and (B) except if the CFC Board shall have
made a CFC Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by  _Section_ __ _
6.9_, solicit the CFC Stockholder Approval. CFC shall, through the CFC Board,
recommend to the CFC Stockholders that they vote for the CFC Stockholder
Approval and shall include such recommendation (the " _CFC Board
Recommendation_ ") in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, except to the
extent that the CFC Board shall have made a CFC Adverse Recommendation Change
as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.9_.

 

(d) CFC may adjourn or postpone the CFC Stockholder Meeting (i) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the CFC Stockholders in advance of a
vote on the CFC Stockholder Approval or (ii) if, as of the time for which the
CFC Stockholder Meeting is 

 



51

    

 originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus),
there are insufficient CFC Stockholders represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such CFC
Stockholder Meeting or there are insufficient votes to obtain the CFC
Stockholder Approval, (A) at the request of Buyer, CFC shall adjourn or
postpone the CFC Stockholder Meeting to a date no more than 10 Business Days
later than the date of the initial CFC Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , that
Buyer may not request that CFC make such an adjournment or postponement more
than once, and (B) CFC may adjourn or postpone the CFC Stockholder Meeting.

(e) Buyer shall, as soon as practicable following the effective date of the
Form S-4, duly call, give proper notice of, convene, and hold a special
meeting of the Buyer Stockholders (the " _Buyer Stockholder Meeting_ ") for
the purpose of obtaining the approval of this Agreement and the issuance of
the Merger Consideration by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
cast if a quorum is present at the Buyer Stockholder Meeting (the " _Buyer
Stockholder Approval_ "). Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (A)
cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Buyer
Stockholders and to hold the Buyer Stockholder Meeting as promptly as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act
and (B) solicit the Buyer Stockholder Approval. Buyer shall, through the Buyer
Board, recommend to the Buyer Stockholders that they vote for the Buyer
Stockholder Approval and shall include such recommendation (the " _Buyer
Board Recommendation_ ") in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contrary contained herein, subject
to _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ if the Buyer Board, after receiving the advice of
its outside counsel and, with respect to the financial matters, its financial
advisor, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue
to recommend that Buyer Stockholders approve this Agreement and the issuance
of the shares of Buyer Common Stock constituting the Merger Consideration in
connection with the Merger, then the Buyer Board may withdraw or modify or
qualify in a manner adverse to CFC its recommendation (the " _Buyer Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") to Buyer Stockholders that they approve the
Agreement and the issuance of the shares of Buyer Common Stock constituting
the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger, and in submitting
such proposal to its Stockholders, the Buyer Board may submit such proposal to
Buyer Stockholders without recommendation or with such modified or qualified
recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement and the
issuance of the shares of Buyer Common Stock constituting the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event the Buyer Board may communicate the
basis for its lack of recommendation or such modified or qualified
recommendation to Buyer Stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.

 

(f) Buyer may adjourn or postpone the Buyer Stockholder Meeting (i) to the
extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to the Buyer Stockholders in
advance of a vote on the Buyer Stockholder Approval or (ii) if, as of the time
for which the Buyer Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient Buyer
Stockholders represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such Buyer Stockholder Meeting or there
are insufficient votes to obtain the Buyer Stockholder Approval.

 



52

    

(g) CFC and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate to schedule and convene the
CFC Stockholder Meeting and the Buyer Stockholder Meeting on the same date.

6.4 _NASDAQ_ _Listing_. Buyer shall cause the shares of Buyer Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on NASDAQ prior to the
Effective Time.

 

6.5 _Employee Matters_

 

(a) All individuals employed by, or on an authorized leave of absence from,
CFC or any of CFC Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") shall automatically become
employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time unless terminated by Buyer effective as of Closing. 

(b) Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, the Surviving Corporation shall provide each Covered Employee with
a rate of base salary or hourly wages that is substantially similar to the
rate of base salary or hourly wages provided to such Covered Employee as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time. Except as provided in the
foregoing and subject to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide each Covered Employee with the same employee
benefits then provided to similarly situated employees at Buyer and
consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 6.5;_ _provided, however_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated
as an amendment of any particular Buyer Benefit Plan or CFC Benefit Plan,
(ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_, (iii) limit the right of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered Employee
at any time or require the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to
provide any such employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage or
annual bonus opportunities for any period following any such termination,
or (iv) obligate Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to (A) maintain any
particular Buyer Benefit Plan or CFC Benefit Plan, as applicable, or (B)
retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee.

 

(c) With respect to any Buyer Benefit Plans in which any Covered Employees
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under
any Buyer Benefit Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous the CFC Benefit
Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and their eligible dependents with
credit for any eligible expenses incurred by such employee or dependent prior
to the Effective Time under a CFC Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such
credit was given under the analogous CFC Benefit Plan prior to the Effective
Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-
pocket requirements under any Buyer Benefit Plans, and (iii) recognize all
service of such employees with CFC and its Subsidiaries for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual other than
accrual for vacation; provided, that, in accordance with Buyers policies, no
vacation or paid time off shall thereafter be carried over into a subsequent
calendar year); _provided_ that the foregoing service recognition shall not
apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the
same period of services, (B) for purposes of benefit accrual, except with
respect to any vacation or paid time off accrual, if any (provided that no 

 



53

    

 vacation or paid time off shall thereafter be carried over into a subsequent
calendar year), or (C) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or that
provides benefits to a grandfathered employee population.

(d) Except for employees of CFC and CFC Subsidiaries with individual
agreements or who are participants in any plan that provides for payment of
severance under certain circumstances (who will be paid severance only in
accordance with such agreements or plan, as the case may be, and shall not
have a right to employer-paid outplacement services), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay severance payments to employees of one or more of CFC
and any CFC Subsidiary (but only if such employee does not have rights to a
severance payment under an employment agreement, in which case no severance
payment shall be made to such employee hereunder,) who is involuntarily
terminated by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (other than for cause) on or
within the time period set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(d)_ of Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, in accordance with the policy described on _Section_ __ _

(g) The terms of the employment arrangement between Buyer and Jerold L.
Rexroad are set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(g)_ of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule.

be made any discretionary employer contributions to participants, and shall
prohibit any new participant elections to defer compensation, under CFCs
deferred compensation plans. Any preexisting deferral elections that are
irrevocable as of the date of this Agreement shall remain in effect for
compensation paid through the end of the periods covered by such deferral
elections. CFCs deferred compensation plans shall remain in full force and
effect and payments of any benefits to participants shall be made in
accordance with the terms of CFCs deferred compensation plans.

 

(i) All accruals existing as of the Effective Time under CFCs and its
Subsidiaries non-equity incentive and/or bonus plans that are consistent

on _Section_ __ _ 6.5(i)_ of the CFC Disclosure Schedule.

(j) The CFC Board shall, prior to the Effective Time, adopt resolutions
terminating its 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (" _CFC 401(k) Plan_ ") effective
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The accounts of all
participants and beneficiaries in the CFC 401(k) Plan shall become fully
vested upon termination of the CFC 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, all account balances in the CFC 401(k) Plan
shall be either distributed to participants and beneficiaries or rolled over
to an eligible tax-qualified retirement

 



54

    

 plan or individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may
direct. Buyer agrees to permit participants in the CFC 401(k) Plan who become
employees of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to roll over their 401(k)
account balances in the CFC 401(k) Plan to the Buyer Bank 401(k) Plan, as

6.6 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_

 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or administrative (a " _Claim_ "),
including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at
any time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the
Effective Time, a director or officer of CFC or any of the CFC Subsidiaries
(each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party
based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the
Parties shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to defend against and
respond thereto. All rights to indemnification (including advancement of
expenses) and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or before the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the CFC Certificate and/or the CFC Bylaws shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
and shall not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified for a period of six
years from and after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions
occurring at or before the Effective Time or taken at the request of Buyer
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, it being understood that nothing in this
sentence shall require any amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
and in each case to the extent such persons are indemnified as of the date of
this Agreement by CFC pursuant to the CFC Certificate, the CFC Bylaws and the
governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of CFC, indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless, and provide advancement of reasonable expenses to,
each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities, or judgments, or amounts that are paid in settlement
of or in connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such Person was a director or officer of
CFC or any CFC Subsidiary (or was serving at the request of CFC or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, or trustee of another Person)
and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions
occurring, at or before the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
before, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request
of Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.7_.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide that portion of directors and officers liability
insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of CFC or any CFC Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Effective Time) (as opposed to CFC) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Time,

 



55

    

 which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and
contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently
provided by CFC; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend, on an annual basis, more than 250% of the
current annual amount expended by CFC (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to maintain
or procure such directors and officers insurance coverage; _provided,_
_further_ , __ that if the Surviving Corporation is unable to maintain or
obtain the insurance called for by this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_, the Surviving
Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount; _provided,
further,_ that officers and directors of CFC or any CFC Subsidiary may be
required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to the Surviving Corporations insurance carrier for the purpose of
obtaining such insurance. In lieu of the foregoing, Buyer may obtain at or
prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under CFCs existing
directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to
that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same
may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the
Insurance Amount.

(d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section_ __
_ 6.6(b)_, upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation
thereof;  _provided_ that the failure so to notify shall not affect the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b_) unless
and to the extent that the Surviving Corporation is actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. The
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall
not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the
benefit of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ without the prior written consent of the
affected Indemnified Party. If the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any other entity and
not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger,
transfer all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other
entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in each case to the extent
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6_ are not otherwise
transferred and assumed by such successors and assigns by operation of law or
otherwise, the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

6.7 _Additional_ _Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Buyer Subsidiary and a CFC
Subsidiary) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities, and franchises of either
Party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each Party and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by _Buyer_.

 

6.8 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Buyer and CFC shall promptly advise the other
of any change or event (a) having or reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on it or (b) that it has determined would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, or covenants contained in this Agreement;

 



56

    

  _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of the Parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement; _provided, further_ , that a failure to comply
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement
or the failure of any condition set forth in  _Article VII_ to be satisfied
unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would
independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VII_
to be satisfied.

 

6.9 _No Solicitation by_ _CFC_

 

(a) Except as specifically permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, CFC shall
not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize
or knowingly permit any of its Representatives to, during the period from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate, or knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information),
any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a CFC Takeover
Proposal, or (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any other Person material non-public information in
connection with, any CFC Takeover Proposal, or otherwise cooperate with or
assist or participate in, or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, any
such inquiries, proposals, discussions, or negotiations or any effort or
attempt to make a CFC Takeover Proposal, except to notify a Person that has
made or, to the Knowledge of CFC, is making any inquiries with respect to, or
is considering making, a CFC Takeover Proposal, of the existence of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_. CFC shall, and shall cause each of
the CFC Subsidiaries and each of its and the CFC Subsidiaries Representatives
to, (A) immediately upon execution of this Agreement, cease any solicitation,
encouragement, discussions, or negotiations with any Person that may be
ongoing with respect to a CFC Takeover Proposal as of the date of this
Agreement, and (B) immediately upon execution of this Agreement, terminate
all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such
Person or its Representatives.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time
prior to obtaining the CFC Stockholder Approval, CFC or any of its
Representatives receives a bona fide written CFC Takeover Proposal from any
Person or group of Persons, which CFC Takeover Proposal did not result from
any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, then CFC and its Representatives
may, (i) contact such Person or group of Persons and their Representatives to
request that such Person or group of Persons provide clarification of any term
or condition of such CFC Takeover Proposal that the CFC Board determines in
good faith to be ambiguous or unclear, and (ii) if the CFC Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such CFC Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely
to result in a CFC Superior Proposal, (A) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable
CFC Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public information)
with respect to CFC and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons
who has made such CFC Takeover Proposal and their respective Representatives;
_provided that_ , CFC shall (subject to the terms of the Acceptable CFC
Confidentiality Agreement) promptly make available to Buyer (through an
electronic data room or otherwise), and provide express written notification
via electronic mail notification to Buyer in accordance with the applicable
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ of, the 

 



57

    

 availability of any written material non-public information that is provided
to any such Person or group of Persons or their respective Representatives,
if such information was not previously provided or made available to Buyer or
its Representatives, and (B) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such CFC Takeover
Proposal and their respective Representatives; _provided_ , _further_ that
CFC shall promptly provide to Buyer (1) a copy of any CFC Takeover Proposal
made in writing by any such Person or group of Persons to CFC, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives, together with the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making the CFC Takeover Proposal,
and (2) a written summary of the material terms of any such CFC Takeover
Proposal not made in writing.

 

(c) CFC shall keep Buyer promptly informed of any material developments,
discussions, or negotiations regarding any CFC Takeover Proposal, including
any such proposal first made to or discussed with CFC prior to the date of
this Agreement and remade after the date of this Agreement (including
forwarding to Buyer any written materials provided to CFC or
its Representatives in connection with any such CFC Takeover Proposal) on a
reasonably prompt basis. Any such disclosure shall be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement. CFC agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will
not enter into any confidentiality or other agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would prohibit CFC from
providing any information to Buyer in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
6.9_.

 

(d) Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.9(e)_, the CFC Board shall not
(i)(A) fail to recommend to the CFC Stockholders that the CFC Stockholder
Approval be given or fail to include the CFC Board Recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw, or
modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw, or
modify, in a manner adverse to Buyer, the CFC Board Recommendation, (C) take
any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection
with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation of
rejection of such offer or a temporary "stop, look, and listen" communication
by the CFC Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or (D) adopt,
approve, or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the CFC
Stockholders, a CFC Takeover Proposal (each of the actions described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a " _CFC Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or
(ii) cause or permit CFC or any of the CFC Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement, or agreement in principle with respect to any CFC
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable CFC Confidentiality Agreement)
(each, a " _CFC Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time the CFC
Stockholder Approval is obtained, the CFC Board may, in connection with a
bona fide written CFC Takeover Proposal, which CFC Takeover Proposal was made
after the date of this Agreement (or that was made prior to the date of this
Agreement and remade after the date of this Agreement) and that did not
result from any breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, make a CFC Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(i)_ to enter into a definitive merger agreement or other definitive
purchase or acquisition agreement with respect to such CFC Takeover Proposal,
if and only if, prior to taking such action, CFC has complied with its
obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ and the CFC Board has determined
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such CFC Takeover Proposal constitutes a CFC Superior
Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be

 



58

    

 reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the CFC Boards fiduciary duties
to its stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior
to taking any such action (i) CFC has given Buyer at least 5 Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such CFC Superior Proposal,
including the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such CFC
Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided a copy to Buyer of all
written materials (including all transaction agreements and related documents)
with or from the party making such CFC Superior Proposal, (ii) CFC has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Buyer during such notice period, to the extent Buyer wishes to negotiate,
to enable Buyer to revise the terms of this Agreement such that it
would cause such CFC Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a CFC Superior
Proposal, and (iii) following the end of such notice period, the CFC Board
shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement proposed in
writing by Buyer, and shall have determined that the CFC Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a CFC Superior Proposal if such revisions were to
be given effect. In the event of any material revisions to a CFC Takeover
Proposal that could have an impact, influence, or other effect on the CFC
Boards decision or discussion with respect to whether such proposal is a CFC
Superior Proposal, CFC shall deliver a new written notice to Buyer pursuant to
the foregoing clause (i) and again comply with the requirements of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.9(e_) with respect to such new written notice; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that references herein to the five Business Day period shall be
deemed to be references to a two Business Day period with respect thereto.

(f) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall prohibit the CFC Board from
(i) taking and disclosing to the CFC Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9, or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act, (ii) making any "stop, look, and listen" communications to
CFC Stockholders pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communications to the CFC Stockholders), or (iii) making
any disclosure to the CFC Stockholders if the CFC Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the CFC
Boards fiduciary duties to its stockholders under applicable Law; _provided,
however_ , that the taking of any action pursuant to any of the preceding
clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) shall in no way limit or modify the effect of this
Agreement with respect to any such action taken.

 

6.10 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either CFC or Buyer shall have failed to
obtain the requisite vote or votes of the CFC Stockholders or the Buyer
Stockholders, respectively, for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at a duly held stockholders meeting or at any
adjournment thereof, then, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to its terms, each of the Parties shall in good faith use its
reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction
provided for herein (it being understood that neither Party shall have any
obligation to alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration
in a manner adverse to such Party or its stockholders) and to resubmit the
transaction to its stockholders for approval, with the timing of such
resubmission to be determined at the request of the other Party.

6.11 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective
Time, CFC and Buyer each shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause (a) any dispositions of CFC Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to CFC Common Stock, options and

 



59

    

 other stock-based awards) resulting from the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who will be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to CFC immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions
or dispositions of Buyer Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Buyer Common Stock, options and other stock-based awards) resulting
from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by
each individual who may become or is reasonably expected to become subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to Buyer immediately following the Effective Time, to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.12 _Data Conversion_. From and after the date hereof, the Parties shall use
reasonable best efforts to facilitate the integration of CFC with the business
of Buyer following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the
data processing and related electronic information technology system (the "
_Data Conversion_ ") to those used by Buyer. The Parties agree to use all
reasonable best efforts to promptly commence preparations for implementation
of the Data Conversion, with the goal of effecting the Data Conversion at the
Effective Time or at such later time as mutually agreed upon by the Parties.
The Parties agree to cooperate in preparing for the Data Conversion,
including by providing reasonable access to data, information systems, and
personnel having expertise with their and their respective Subsidiaries
information and data systems; _provided, however_ , that neither Party shall
be required to terminate any third-party service provider arrangements prior
to the Effective Time.

6.13 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_. Each of Buyer and CFC agrees to
exercise good faith and use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy the various
covenants and conditions to Closing in this Agreement, and to take or cause to
be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary,
proper, or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect
all necessary notices, reports, and other filings, and to obtain as promptly
as reasonably practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits,
and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
Governmental Entity or other third party in order to consummate the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.14 _Securityholder Litigation_. Each Party shall keep the other Party
reasonably informed with respect to the defense or settlement of any
securityholder Action against it or its directors or officers relating to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party
shall give the other Party the opportunity to consult with it regarding
the defense or settlement of any such securityholder Action and shall not
settle any such Action without the other Partys prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

6.15 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement

 



60

    

 and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses.

fairness opinion referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 3.22_ solely for

6.17 _Dividends_. CFC and Buyer shall coordinate with each other regarding the
declaration, setting of record dates, and payment dates of dividends with
respect to shares of CFC Common Stock and Buyer Common Stock for the purpose
of minimizing the risk that holders of shares of CFC Common Stock (a) in
respect of any calendar quarter, receive dividends on both shares of CFC
Common Stock and shares of Buyer Common Stock received as Merger
Consideration, or (b) in respect of any calendar quarter, fail to receive a
dividend on shares of CFC Common Stock or shares of Buyer Common Stock
received as Merger Consideration.

6.18 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium," or other anti-takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to Buyer, CFC, the Merger, or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, then each of CFC and the CFC Board on the one hand, and Buyer
and the Buyer Board on the other hand, shall grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

Buyer Bank shall take all required action to appoint Jerold L. Rexroad to

thousandth) obtained by dividing

 



65

    

 (A) the product of the Index Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then in

period, it shall give prompt written notice to CFC of such election and the
revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant

modified).

the references to "twenty-five percent (25%)" in the definition of "CFC

equal to the Termination Fee upon the earlier date of such execution or
consummation;

 

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Buyer or CFC pursuant to _Section_

Termination Fee upon the earlier date of such execution or consummation;

 

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by CFC pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_,
then CFC shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer, prior to or

8.1(i)_ shall be void and of no force or effect unless and until CFC shall
have made such payment);

(b) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained

contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements, the other
Party would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if CFC fails to pay
amounts due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Buyer commences a suit that results in a judgment against CFC for the
Termination Fee, then CFC shall pay Buyer its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,

payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate
published in the _Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required
to be made.

shall be no other liability on the part of CFC to Buyer. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, no Party hereto will be relieved
or released from any liability or damages arising from a willful or
intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement or fraud, and the
aggrieved Party will be entitled to all rights and remedies available at Law
or in equity.

 



67

    

(d) Any Termination Fee that is owed by CFC pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)_ will be paid in the aggregate to Buyer by or at the direction of CFC
in immediately available funds upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to
the obligation to make such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall CFC be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

8.3 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action
taken or authorized, in the case of CFC, by the CFC Board and, in the case of
Buyer, by the Buyer Board, at any time before or after the receipt of the CFC
Stockholder Approval or the Buyer Stockholder Approval; _provided, however_ ,
that after receipt of any such Stockholder approval, no amendment shall be
made which by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange requires further approval by the CFC Stockholders or the Buyer
Stockholders, as applicable, without such further approval. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of CFC and
Buyer.

 

8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Effective Time, the Parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may,

of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

the words "without limitation." The schedules and all exhibits hereto, shall
be deemed part of this Agreement and included in any reference to this
Agreement. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to require any
Person to take any action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would
violate any applicable Law.

10.5 _Entire_ _Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules and
exhibits hereto, and the other documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts made and performed within such state, without regard to any
applicable conflict of laws principles.

 

10.7 _Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties to this Agreement
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts of the State of North Carolina or
any federal courts of the United States of America sitting in the State of
North Carolina and any appellate courts from any thereof, in any Action or

contemplated by this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and agrees that all claims in respect of any such Action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such North Carolina court or, to
the extent permitted by Law, in such federal court.

 



81

    

10.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Parties waives to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with

its Subsidiaries or agents to, issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which consent shall

10.10 _Assignment; Third-_ _Party_ _Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations

operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, each of the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns. Other than (i) as otherwise
specifically provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ and (ii) _ Articles I_ and _II_
(which, after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of holders of CFC
Common Stock and any holder of an award granted under a CFC Stock Plan), this
Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement) is not intended to and does not confer upon any Person other than
the Parties any rights or remedies under this Agreement.

(b) No provision in this Agreement modifies or amends or creates any employee
benefit plan, program, or document (each, a " _Benefit Plan_ ") unless this
Agreement explicitly states that the provision "amends" or "creates" that
Benefit Plan, and no third party shall be entitled to enforce any provision
of this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to, or a creation of,
a Benefit Plan, unless that provision explicitly states that such enforcement
rights are being conferred. This provision shall not prevent the Parties to
this Agreement from enforcing any provision of this Agreement. If a Person not
entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce
any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to, or creation of a
Benefit Plan, and that provision is construed to be such an amendment or
creation despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement,
that provision shall lapse retroactively, thereby precluding it from having
any effect.

 

10.11 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
each of the Parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the
terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby further waives (a)
any defense in any action for specific

 



82

    

 performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

 

10.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant, or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a final and unappealable Order of a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, then
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants, and restrictions contained
in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way
be affected, impaired, or invalidated unless the effect would be to cause this
Agreement to not achieve its essential purposes.

 

10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Executed counterparts of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been fully delivered and shall become legally binding if and when executed

a Party. If so delivered by facsimile or electronic mail transmission, the
Parties agree, if requested by the other Party, to promptly send original,
manually executed copies by nationwide overnight delivery service.

 

10.14 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement, and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

10.15 _Calculation of Dates and Deadlines_. Unless otherwise specified, any
period of time to be determined under this Agreement shall be deemed to
commence at 12:01 a.m. on the first full day after the specified starting
date, event, or occurrence. Any deadline, due date, expiration date, or
period-end to be calculated under this Agreement shall be deemed to end at
