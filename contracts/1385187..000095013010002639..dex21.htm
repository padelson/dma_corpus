vii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of June 1,
2010 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), is by and among ev3 Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Covidien Group S.a.r.l., a Luxembourg company
(the " _Parent_ "), and COV Delaware Corporation, a Delaware corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent (the " _Purchaser_ ").

A. The respective Boards of Directors of the Parent, the Purchaser and the
Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by the Parent upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

B. In furtherance of such acquisition, (i) Parent has agreed to cause the
Purchaser to commence a tender offer (such offer, as amended from time to
time as permitted by this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the
shares (the " _Shares_ ") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") that are outstanding, at a price of
$22.50 per Share, paid to the seller in cash, without interest thereon (such
amount or any higher amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer,
the " _Offer Price_ ") and (ii) the Company has granted to the Purchaser the
Top-Up Option.

C. Following the consummation of the Offer upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall cause the Purchaser to be
merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation (the " _Merger_ "), and each Share that is not tendered and
accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than Shares cancelled pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares, shall thereupon be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the
Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

D. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (i) determined that
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Transactions_ "), are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement, the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, resolved to recommend that all holders of
Shares (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") tender their Shares pursuant to the
Offer and, if required by applicable Law, adopt this Agreement and approve the
Merger (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ").

E. The respective boards of directors of the Parent and the Purchaser have
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, and have declared it advisable for the Parent and
the Purchaser, respectively, to enter into this Agreement.

 

F. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to the Parent entering into this Agreement, certain
Company Stockholders have entered into a tender and voting agreement, dated as
of the Agreement, in substantially the form set forth in _Annex II_ hereof,
pursuant to which, among other things, each of such Company Stockholders has
agreed to tender his, her or its Shares to the Purchaser in the Offer (the "
_Tender and Voting Agreement_ ").

 

G. The Parent, the Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer and
the Merger.



 

1 Accordingly, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally
bound, agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with  _Section 8.1_, as promptly as
practicable after the Agreement Date (but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date of the initial public announcement of this
Agreement), the Purchaser shall, and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to,
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
" _Exchange Act_ ")), the Offer to purchase all of the Shares at the Offer
Price. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " means a day other
than a Saturday, a Sunday or another day on which commercial banking
institutions in New York, New York are authorized or required by Law to be
closed.

(b) _Terms and Conditions of Offer_. Subject to (i) there being validly
tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date
that number of Shares which, together with the number of Shares, if any, then
owned of record by the Parent or the Purchaser or their respective wholly
owned Subsidiaries or with respect to which the Parent or the Purchaser has,
directly or indirectly, voting power, representing at least a majority of all
outstanding Shares (determined on a Fully Diluted Basis) entitled to vote (x)
in the election of directors or (y) upon the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger, on the date Shares are accepted for payment
(collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction or
waiver by the Parent or the Purchaser of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_ , the Purchaser shall, and the Parent
shall cause the Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly
as practicable after the Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under
applicable federal, state, local, or foreign law, statute, rule, regulation,
final and enforceable ordinance or Order of any Governmental Entity (" _Law_
") (the date and time of acceptance for payment, the " _Share Acceptance
Time_ "). The Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the Purchaser on
a timely basis funds sufficient to purchase and pay for any and all Shares
that the Purchaser becomes obligated to accept for payment and purchase
pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
paid net to the holder of such Share in cash, without interest, subject to
any withholding of any Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
_Section 3.5_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Fully Diluted Basis_ "
means, as of any date, (i) the number of Shares outstanding plus (ii) the
number of Shares the Company is then required to issue pursuant to options,
warrants, rights to acquire or other obligations outstanding at such date,
other securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares
or otherwise, including pursuant to the Company Equity Plans, but excluding
any (x) Shares attributable to the unexercised portion of the Top-Up Option
and (y) any options, warrants and other rights to acquire Shares that are not
vested as of the date of purchase and would not be vested immediately after
giving effect to the consummation of the Offer or prior to the End Date.

 

(c) _Offer to Purchase; Waiver of Conditions_. The Offer shall be made by
means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that describes
the terms and conditions of the Offer in accordance with this Agreement,
including the conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. The Parent
and the Purchaser expressly reserve the right (but shall not be obligated) to
increase the Offer Price, waive any condition to the Offer (except the Minimum
Condition) or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the
Offer; _provided, however_ , that unless previously approved by the Company
in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price payable in
the Offer, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the

 



 

2  Offer, (iii) reduce the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the
Offer, (iv) impose any condition to the Offer in addition to the conditions to
the Offer set forth in _Annex I,_ (v) amend or waive the Minimum Condition,
(vi) amend or modify the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ in a manner
adverse to the holders of Shares or that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer or prevent, materially delay or impair the ability
of the Parent or the Purchaser to consummate the Offer, (vii) extend the
Expiration Date other than in accordance with this Agreement, or (viii)
otherwise amend any other term of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders
of Shares.

(d)  _Expiration of Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
Offer shall expire on the 20th or 21st Business Day (calculated in accordance
with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) following the
commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Offer
has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, at the time and date to
which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such
later time and date to which the Offer has been extended in accordance with
this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

 

(e) _Extension of Offer_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) the Purchaser shall extend the
Offer for any period or periods required by (x) applicable Law, (y) applicable
rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff or (z) any of
the rules and regulations, including listing standards, of the Nasdaq Global
Market or other United States national securities exchange registered under
the Exchange Act on which the applicable common stock is then traded (the "
_Securities Exchange Rule_ "), (ii) in the event that any of the conditions to
the Offer set forth on _Annex I_ hereto are not satisfied or waived as of any
then scheduled Expiration Date, the Purchaser may extend the Offer for

notice at least two (2) Business Days prior to such scheduled Expiration
Date, request that the Purchaser extend the Offer for up to two (2) successive
periods of ten (10) Business Days per extension period, until all of the
conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex I_ hereto are satisfied or, to
the extent permitted, validly waived; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing clause (i) of this _Section 1.1(e)_, in no
event shall the Purchaser be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier
to occur of (1) the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1_ hereof or (2) the End Date; and _provided, further_ , that the foregoing

provide for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof)
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (each a " _Subsequent
Offering Period_ "); _provided, however,_ that if the Purchaser is required to
exercise the Top-Up Option pursuant to  _Section 1.4(a)_, the Purchaser
shall not be permitted to provide for a Subsequent Offering Period. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the Purchaser shall,
and the Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, immediately accept for payment,
and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during

filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to holders
of the Shares, not to contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except no covenant

or the Purchaser in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company agrees to cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders. The Company, on the one
hand, and the Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly
correct any information provided by such party for use in the Schedule 14D-9,
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law,
and the Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Parent, the Purchaser
and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the

due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel. In addition, the
Company shall provide the Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel with copies
of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the
Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. The Parent, the Purchaser and their

as may be required by Law or (ii) as contemplated or permitted by Section 6.3.

 

(b) _Communication Materials_. Promptly after the Agreement Date (and in any
event in sufficient time to permit the Purchaser to commence the Offer in a
timely manner) and otherwise from time to time as requested by the Purchaser
or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting
beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files containing the
names and addresses of the record or beneficial owners of the Shares as of the
most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish the Purchaser
with such information (including updated lists of holders of the Shares and
their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting
beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as the Purchaser or its
agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and beneficial
owners of Shares, in connection with the preparation and dissemination of the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents and the solicitation of tenders of Shares
in the Offer.

 

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

 

(a) _Designation of Directors by Parent_. Effective upon the Share Acceptance
Time and from time to time thereafter so long as the Parent directly or
indirectly beneficially owns not less than a majority of the issued and
outstanding Shares, the Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company
Board as is equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on the
Company Board (giving effect to the election or appointment of any additional
directors pursuant to this _Section 1.3_) and (ii) the percentage that the
number of Shares beneficially owned



 

5  by the Parent and/or the Purchaser (including Shares accepted for payment in
the Offer and the purchased Top-Up Option Shares, if any) bears to the total
number of Shares outstanding, and the Company shall, upon request by the
Purchaser, promptly increase the size of the Company Board or use its
reasonable best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors
as is necessary to provide the Purchaser with such level of representation
and shall cause the Purchasers designees to be so elected or appointed.
Subject to subsection (c) of this _Section 1.3_, after the Share Acceptance
Time the Company shall also cause individuals designated by the Purchaser to
constitute the same percentage as such individuals represent of the entire
Company Board on the following: (i) each committee of the Company Board (other
than any committee of the Company Board comprised solely of
Continuing Directors established to take action under this Agreement); (ii)
each board of directors and each committee thereof of each wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) the designees, appointees or other similar
representatives of the Company on each board of directors (or other similar
governing body) and each committee thereof of each non-wholly owned
Subsidiary. The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder as well as the Securities Exchange Rules. At the
request of the Purchaser, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
effect any such election or appointment of the Purchasers designees,
including mailing to the Company Stockholders the information required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder which,
unless the Purchaser otherwise elects, shall be so mailed together with
the Schedule 14D-9; _provided_ , that the Parent and the Purchaser shall have
timely supplied to the Company all information with respect to themselves and
their respective officers, directors and Affiliates (as defined in Rule 12b-2
of the Exchange Act (the " _Affiliates_ ")) required by such Section and
Rule.

(b) _Continuing Directors_. Following the election or appointment of the
Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ and
until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall at all times include, and
the Company, the Parent and the Purchaser shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Company Board to at all times include, at least three (3)
Continuing Directors and each committee of the Company Board and the board of
directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of the Company shall at all
times include, and the Company, the Parent and the Purchaser shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause each committee of the Company Board and the
board of directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of the Company to at
all times include, at least one (1) Continuing Director. A " _Continuing
Director_ " shall mean a person who is a member of the Company Board as of the
Agreement Date or a person selected by the Continuing Directors then in
office, each of whom shall be an independent director for purposes of
applicable Securities Exchange Rules and shall be eligible to serve on the
Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and Securities Exchange
Rules and, at least one of whom shall be an "audit committee financial
expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K and the instructions
thereto; _provided, however_ that if the number of Continuing Directors is
reduced to less than three (3) prior to the Effective Time, any remaining
Continuing Directors (or Continuing Director, if there shall be only one (1)
remaining) shall be entitled to designate a person who is not an officer,
director, stockholder or designee of Parent or any of its Affiliates to fill
such vacancy, and such person shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for
all purposes of this Agreement, or, if no Continuing Directors then remain,
the other directors shall designate three (3) persons who are not officers,
directors, stockholders or designees of Parent or any of its Affiliates to
fill such vacancies, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(c) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that the Parents
designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_, the approval of a majority of such
Continuing Directors (or the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only
one (1) Continuing Director) shall be required in order to (i) amend, modify
or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment,
modification or termination of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the
Company, (ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the
obligations or other acts of the Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement,
(iii) waive or exercise any of the Companys rights under this Agreement,
(iv) waive any condition to the Companys obligations under this Agreement,
(v) amend the Company Charter or Company

 



 

6  Bylaws, (vi) authorize any agreement between the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company, on the one hand, and the Parent, the Purchaser or
any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, or (vii) make any other
determination with respect to any action to be taken or not to be taken by or
on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. For
purposes of considering any matter set forth in this  _Section 1.3(c)_, the
Continuing Directors shall be permitted to meet without the presence of the
other directors. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain
such counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other
advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing
Directors and shall have the authority to institute any action on behalf of
the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement or any of the Companys
rights hereunder.

Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) _Grant and Availability of Top-Up Option_. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Company hereby grants to the Purchaser an
irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase, at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price, that number of newly issued Shares (the " _Top-Up
Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to
the number of Shares owned by the Purchaser, the Parent and their wholly owned
Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option (including all
Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer at the Share
Acceptance Time but excluding Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of
such guarantee), constitutes one Share more than 90% of all
outstanding Shares (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares). The
Top-Up Option shall only be exercised one time by the Purchaser in whole but
not in part. The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by the Purchaser (and the
Parent shall cause the Purchaser to exercise the Top-Up Option) promptly (but
in no event later than one (1) Business Day) after the Share Acceptance Time
or the expiration of a Subsequent Offering Period, as applicable, if (i) at
the Share Acceptance Time or the expiration of any such Subsequent Offering
Period, as applicable, the Parent, the Purchaser or any wholly owned
Subsidiary own in the aggregate at least 75% of all Shares then outstanding
(excluding Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that
have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee)
and (ii) after giving effect to the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the Parent,
the Purchaser and any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent or the Purchaser
would own in the aggregate one share more than 90% of the number of
outstanding Shares (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares but excluding Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of
such guarantee); _provided, however_ , that the obligation of the Purchaser to
exercise the Top-Up Option and the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up
Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the
conditions, unless waived by the Company, that (x) no provision of any
applicable Law and no applicable order, injunction or other judgment shall
prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up
Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (y) upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option, the number of Shares owned by the Parent or the Purchaser or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent or the Purchaser (excluding Shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) constitutes one
Share more than 90% of the number of Shares that will be outstanding
immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, and (z) the
number of Top-Up Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall in
no event exceed the number of authorized and unissued shares of Company Common
Stock less the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock potentially
necessary for issuance with respect to all outstanding Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Stock, Company RSUs or other obligations of the Company.
The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable Laws, including
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option
Shares under the Securities Act; provided, further, that the Top-Up Option
shall terminate concurrently with the termination of this Agreement.

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up Option_. Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in
accordance with _Section 1.4(a)_, the Parent shall so notify the Company and
shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of Shares that are expected to
be owned by the Parent, the Purchaser or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the



 

7  Parent or the Purchaser immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares and (ii) a place and time for the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Option Shares (which, subject to applicable Law and any required
regulatory approvals, shall be effected as promptly as practicable and not
more than two (2) Business Days after date such notice is delivered to the
Company). Such notice shall also include an undertaking signed by the Parent
and the Purchaser that, as promptly as practicable following such exercise of
the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser shall, and the Parent shall cause the
Purchaser to, as promptly as practicable after such exercise and the
delivery by the Company of the Top-Up Option Shares, consummate the Merger in
accordance with the terms hereof. The Company shall, as soon as practicable
following receipt of such notice, notify the Parent and the Purchaser of the
number of Shares then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At
the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, the Parent or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall pay the Company the aggregate price
required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares, and the Company shall cause
to be issued to the Parent or the Purchaser, as applicable, a certificate
representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable
for the Top-Up Option Shares may be paid by the Parent or the Purchaser (i)
in cash or (ii) by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price
for the Top-Up Option Shares, or some combination thereof. Any
such promissory note shall be on terms as provided by the Parent or the
Purchaser, which terms shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Upon
the delivery of the appropriate exercise notice and the tender of the
consideration described above, the Purchaser shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, be deemed to be the holder of record of the Top-Up Option
Shares issuable upon that exercise, notwithstanding that certificates
representing those Top-Up Option Shares shall not then be actually delivered
to the Purchaser or the Company shall have failed to refused to designate the
account described above.

 

(c) _Accredited Investor Status_. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all
applicable Law. Consistent therewith, the Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge
that the Top-Up Option Shares that the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of
the Parent and the Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Company
that the Purchaser will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares an
"accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. The Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by the Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).

opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement prior to filing such with the SEC, and will provide the Parent with
a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. If at any time prior to the
Special Meeting any fact or event relating to the Parent or the Purchaser or
any of their Affiliates that is required by Law to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement should occur or be discovered
by the Parent or the Purchaser, the Parent or the Purchaser shall, promptly
after becoming aware thereof, inform the Company of such fact or event.

 

(c) _Voting of Shares by Parent_. At the Special Meeting or any postponement
or adjournment thereof, the Parent shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of
the Shares then owned of record by the Parent or the Purchaser or with respect
to which the Parent or the Purchaser otherwise has, directly or indirectly,
voting power in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger and the Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or
provide (or cause to be delivered or provided), in its capacity as a
stockholder of the Company, any other approvals that are required by
applicable Law to effect the Merger.

Section 2.4 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding the
terms of  _Section 2.3_, if after the Share Acceptance Time and, if
applicable, the expiration of any Subsequent Offering Period provided by the
Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement or the Purchasers exercise of the
Top-Up Option, the Parent and the Purchaser shall then hold of record, in the
aggregate, at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of capital
stock of the Company entitled to vote on the adoption of this Agreement under
applicable Law (the " _Short Form Threshold_ "), the parties hereto agree to
take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as promptly as practicable, but no later than the time set forth in
_Section 2.2_, without a meeting of Company Stockholders in accordance with
Section 253 of the DGCL.



 

10 ARTICLE III

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES

 

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, pursuant to
this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Company, the Purchaser or the holder of any Shares or any shares of
capital stock of the Purchaser:

 

(a) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Purchaser issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall convert into and
become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Parent or
the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether pursuant to the
Offer or otherwise) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no payment or distribution shall be made or delivered with respect
thereto.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 3.4_, each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash, payable to the holder thereon, without any
interest thereon, equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall be automatically cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time
of Shares not represented by certificates (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") and the
holders of certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive, upon transfer of
such Book Entry Shares or delivery of such Certificates in accordance with
_Section 3.2_, the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for
each such Share held by them.

 

(d) If at any time between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time any
change in the number of outstanding Shares shall occur as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period,
other than the Merger, the amount of the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 3.1(c)_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Closing, the Parent shall deliver, in trust, to Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the Company
Stockholders at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash hereinafter referred to as "
_Consideration Fund_ "). In the event the Consideration Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by
_Section 3.1_ (including with respect to former Dissenting Shares held by
Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting
Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL), the Parent shall promptly deliver, or
cause to be delivered, additional funds to the Paying Agent in an amount that
is equal to the deficiency required to make such payments.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the Effective Time), the Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book Entry Shares
whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1_: (i) a letter of transmittal, in customary form,
that shall specify that delivery of such Certificates or transfer of such Book
Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
transfer of the Book Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
transfer of the Book Entry Shares in



 

11  exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration in customary form. Upon
receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent in connection with the
transfer of a Book Entry Share or surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, in each case together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
with such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Book Entry Share or Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding of Taxes,
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ ,
and the Book Entry Share so transferred or Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid to holders of Book Entry
Shares or Certificates in connection with, or accrued on, the Merger
Consideration. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to any natural
person or any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
association, trust or other entity or organization, including any Governmental
Entity (" _Person_ ") other than a Person in whose name the Book Entry Share
transferred or Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Book Entry Share transferred or Certificate surrendered, or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(c) The Consideration Fund may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Earnings on the Consideration Fund in
excess of the amounts payable to Company Stockholders shall be the sole and
exclusive property of the Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be
paid to the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the Parent directs. No
investment of the Consideration Fund shall relieve the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by
this _Article III_ , and following any losses from any such investment, the
Parent shall promptly provide additional cash funds to the Paying Agent for
the benefit of the Company Stockholder at the Effective Time in the amount of
such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Consideration Fund.

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article III_ , except
as otherwise provided by Law.

 

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former Company
Stockholders six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect to such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the
Consideration Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book Entry
Share shall not have been surrendered or transferred prior to the date
on which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, and any holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect thereto shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim
for Merger Consideration in respect thereof. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall not have been surrendered prior to two (2) years after the
Effective Time, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate
or Book Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

12 (g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Parent and the Paying Agent) by the Person
claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by
the Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such
Certificate pursuant to this _Article III_.

 

Section 3.3 _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, other than as
provided in _Section 3.3(b)_, any Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Company Stockholder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
unless and until such Company Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such stockholders right to
obtain payment of the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares under
the DGCL, but shall instead be entitled only to such rights with respect to
such Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such stockholder under the DGCL.
From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to
vote for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or
other distributions (except dividends or other distributions payable to
stockholders of record prior to the Effective Time). The Company shall give
the Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments, notices,
petitions, or other communication received from stockholders or provided to
stockholders by the Company with respect to any Dissenting Shares or shares
claimed to be Dissenting Shares, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. Except with the prior written consent of the Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
dissent.

(b) If any Company Stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares effectively
withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
stockholders right to obtain payment of the fair value of such stockholders
Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time
and the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss, such stockholders
Shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and, if the occurrence of such
effective withdrawal or loss is later than the Effective Time, shall be
treated as if they had as of the Effective Time been converted into the right
to receive Merger Consideration, without interest, as set forth in _Section
3.1(c)_.

 

Section 3.4 _Company Equity Awards._

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering any Company Equity Plan) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions as may be required to provide that (i)
each unexercised Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled, and, in
exchange therefor, each former holder of each such cancelled Company Stock
Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of
such Company Stock Option and in settlement therefor, an amount in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law)
equal to (x) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such
Company Stock Option, multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares previously
subject to such Company Stock Option, whether or not vested (such amount,
the " _Option Amount_ "); (ii) each share of Company Restricted Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and
become non-forfeitable effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and
shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ (subject to any
applicable

 



 

13  withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law), and (iii) each Company RSU
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Shares issued
thereunder shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_
(subject to any applicable withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law).
All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ shall be paid as promptly
as practicable following the Effective Time, and in any event no later than
ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time, without interest, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payments as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time in accordance with the foregoing and the
terms of the Company Stock Options or the applicable Company Equity
Plans pursuant to which they were issued.

(b) Within ten (10) Business Days following the Agreement Date, the Company
shall provide notice to all holders of Company Stock Options specifying that
such Company Stock Options will not be assumed in connection with the Merger
and describing the treatment of such Company Stock Options in accordance with
this  _Section 3.4_ and the terms of the applicable Company Equity Plan and
will permit each holder of a Company Stock Option who desires to exercise all
or any portion of such Company Stock Option following receipt of such notice
to exercise such Company Stock Option prior to the Effective Time.

(c) The Companys ESPP shall continue to be operated in accordance with its
terms and past practice for the current Offering (as defined in the ESPP) ("
_Offering_ "); _provided_ that if the Effective Time is expected to occur
prior to the end of the current Offering, the Company shall take action to
provide for an earlier Purchase Date (as defined in the ESPP) in accordance
with Section 5 of the ESPP. Such earlier Purchase Date shall be as close to
the Effective Time as is administratively practicable, and the Company shall
notify each participant in writing, at least ten (10) days prior to the
earlier Purchase Date, that the Purchase Date for his or her option (including
for purposes of determining the Purchase Price of such option) has been
changed to the earlier Purchase Date and that his or her option will be
exercised automatically on the earlier Purchase Date, unless prior to such
date he or she has withdrawn from the Offering as provided in Section 11 of
the ESPP. The Company shall suspend the commencement of any future Offerings
under the ESPP unless and until this Agreement is terminated and shall
terminate the ESPP as of the Effective Time.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as disclosed in (a) the Company SEC Reports filed by the Company prior
to the Agreement Date (excluding any disclosure set forth therein under the
heading "Risk Factors", or any disclosures in any section related to forward-
looking statement to the extent that they are predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature) or (b) the disclosure schedule of the Company
delivered to the Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure
Schedule"_ ) (with specific reference to the section of this Agreement to
which the information stated in such Company Disclosure Schedule relates; 
_provided_ that (i) disclosure in any section of such Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of
this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable or relevant to such other
Section and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such Company Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect), the Company represents and warrants to the Parent
and the Purchaser as follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Organization_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other entity
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization and has the requisite entity power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to the Parent a copy of its amended and
restated certificate of incorporation (the " _Company Charter_ ") and bylaws
(the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as currently in effect. As of the Agreement Date,
the Company is a "Target Company" as defined in Chapter 80B.01 of the
Minnesota Statutes.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "
means any material adverse change in, or material adverse effect on, the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that any change or
effect resulting from (i) the industries and markets in which the Company and
its Subsidiaries operate, (ii) the United States or the global economy or
(iii) the United States financial or securities markets shall be excluded from
the determination of Company Material Adverse Effect, in the case of clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), to the extent they have not had, or would reasonably be
expected not to have, a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries relative to other companies in the same industry as the
Company; and _provided further_ that any change or effect resulting from the
following, shall not constitute, and shall not be considered in determining
whether there has occurred, a Company Material Adverse Effect: (1) the
execution or the announcement of this Agreement, (2) natural disasters, acts
of war, terrorism or sabotage, military actions or the escalation thereof or
other _force majeure_ events, (3) changes in GAAP or changes in the
interpretation of GAAP, or changes in the accounting rules and regulations of
the SEC, (4) any enactment or other action required by Law, required by this
Agreement or taken at the request of the Parent or the Purchaser, (5) any
litigation brought or threatened by stockholders of either the Parent or the



 

15  Company (whether on behalf of the Company, the Parent or otherwise)
asserting allegations of breach of fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement
or violations of securities Laws in connection with the Schedule 14D-9, the
Proxy Statement, if any, and each other document required to be filed by the
Company with the SEC or required to be distributed or otherwise disseminated
to the Company Stockholders in connection with the
Transactions (collectively, the " _Company Disclosure Documents_ "), (6) any
changes in Law or interpretations thereof (including any health reform
statutes, rules or regulations or interpretations thereof), (7) any action
required to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC or the SEC
comment process, in each case, in connection with any Company Disclosure
Document, (8) any decrease in the market price or trading volume of Company

securities analysts (but not the underlying cause of such failure), or (10)
any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Section 4.2  _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 300,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, par value one cent ($0.01) per share, of
which 113,940,546 are issued and outstanding as of May 27, 2010 and (ii)
100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, none of
which are issued or outstanding on the Agreement Date. All of the outstanding
shares of the Companys capital stock are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. As of the Agreement
Date, except as set forth in  _Section 4.2_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are, and at the Share Acceptance Time there will be, no
existing (i) shares of any class of capital stock or options, warrants, calls,

obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or (iii) voting trusts or similar agreements to which the Company is a party

(b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or equivalent equity
interests of each of the Companys Subsidiaries are owned of record and
beneficially, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all
material liens, pledges, security interests or other encumbrances. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Subsidiary_ " means, as to any Person, any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, association or other
business entity (i) of which such Person directly or indirectly owns
securities or other equity interests representing more than 50% of the
aggregate voting power or (ii) of which such Person possesses more than 50% of
the right to elect directors or Persons holding similar positions.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any interest or
investment (whether equity or debt) in any corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other entity, other than a Subsidiary of the Company.

Section 4.3  _Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Company Action_. The
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if
required, to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Offer, the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares (assuming the
Top-Up Option is exercised pursuant to  _Section 1.4_), the Merger and the
other Transactions have been duly authorized by the Company Board and, except,
in the case of the Merger, for the Company Stockholder Approval, if required,
and for the filing of the Certificate of Merger or other appropriate
documents with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, no other
corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation
by it of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution
and delivery hereof by the Parent and the Purchaser, is a valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms,



 

16  except that (a) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar
Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights and remedies
generally and (b) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

Section 4.4 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions will not, (a) violate any provision of the Company Charter or the
Company Bylaws, (b) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with
or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
license, contract, agreement or other obligation, whether written or oral ("
_Contract_ "), to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
by which any of them or any of their properties or assets is bound, (c)
violate any Law applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their properties or assets or (d) other than in connection with or compliance
with (i) the DGCL, (ii) requirements under other state corporation Laws,
(iii) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended
(the " _HSR Act_ ") and other Antitrust Laws, (iv) Securities Exchange Rules,
(v) the Exchange Act and (vi) such filings as may be required under Chapter
80B of the Minnesota Statutes, require the Company to make any filing or
registration with or notification to, or require the Company to obtain any
authorization, consent or approval of, any court, legislative, executive or
regulatory authority or agency (a " _Governmental Entity_ "); except, in the
case of clauses (b), (c) and (d), for such violations, breaches or defaults
that, or filings, registrations, notifications, authorizations, consents or
approvals the failure of which to make or obtain, would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect and would not materially adversely affect the ability of the Company
to consummate the Transactions.

Section 4.5 _SEC Reports; Disclosure Controls and Procedures_.

(a) The Company has filed all reports and other documents with the SEC
required to be filed by the Company since December 31, 2006 (the " _Company
SEC Reports_ "). As of their respective filing dates, the Company SEC Reports
(i) complied in all material respects with, to the extent in effect at the
time of filing, the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each of the financial statements
(including the related notes) of the Company included in the Company SEC
Reports complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material respects
with the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto in effect at the time of such
filing, was prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the respective periods then ended
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end
adjustments). Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has been no change in the
Companys accounting policies or the methods of making accounting estimates
or changes in estimates that are material to the Companys financial
statements, except as described in the Company SEC Reports or except as may be
required by any regulatory authority.

 

(b) Since December 31, 2006, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has had
in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) reasonably designed and
maintained to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys



 

17  management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and

Each such contract described in clauses (i)-(x) is referred to herein as a "

Each Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms and, to the

written notice, nor does the Company have Knowledge, of any material violation
of or material default of any obligation under (or any condition which with

violation of or material default under) any Material Contract to which it is
a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Company s Knowledge_" or " _Knowledge of
the Company_ " means such facts and other information that as of the date of

Section 4.9 _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

 

(a) Section 4.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the date of

(i) that is currently maintained, contributed (or required to be contributed)
to, or sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (iii) with respect to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability,
including any material contingent liability, for the payment or delivery of
any premiums, compensation or benefits (collectively, the " _Benefit Plans_
"). For purposes of the preceding sentence, an "employee benefit plan" is any
of the following that benefits or is intended to benefit any current or former
employee or director (whether or not an employee) of, or consultant or other
service provider (whether or not an employee) with respect to the Company or
an ERISA Affiliate (as defined in Section 4.9(b)), or the beneficiaries of any
of them: (A) a "plan" described in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "); (B) a stock bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, restricted stock unit, stock
appreciation right, or other equity-based plan, policy, program, agreement or
arrangement; or (C) an incentive, bonus, deferred compensation, welfare,
retiree medical or life insurance, retirement, supplemental retirement,
termination, salary continuation, severance, change in control, and any
material fringe benefit or other material benefit plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement, whether written or unwritten. With respect to each
Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered to Parent a true and complete copy of
each of the following, together with all amendments: (i) all documents
embodying the Benefit Plan (or, where a Benefit Plan has not been reduced to
writing, a summary of all material Plan terms), (ii) in the case of any
funded Benefit Plan, the trust agreement or similar instrument, (iii) for
each Benefit Plan subject to the requirement that annual reports be filed on a
Form 5500, the two most recently filed annual reports, with schedules,
financial statements and auditors opinion attached, (iv) in the case of each
Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, the
most recent IRS determination or opinion letter applicable to the Benefit
Plan, (v) all related custodial agreements, insurance policies (including
fiduciary liability insurance covering the fiduciaries of the Benefit Plan),
administrative services and similar agreements, and investment advisory or
investment management agreements, if any, and (vi) the most recent summary
plan description, summaries of material modifications or similar summary and
any employee handbook referencing the Benefit Plan.

 

(b) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other person
(including an entity) that together with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or at any relevant time was treated as a single employer under
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, together with the Company
and any of its 



 

19  Subsidiaries, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") has ever contributed or been
required to contribute to, or has ever sponsored, maintained or participated
in, (i) a pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject
to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a multiemployer plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), or (iii) a
single employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of
ERISA) for which an ERISA Affiliate would reasonably be expected to incur
liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Except as described in Section
4.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, by themselves or together with any other event, cause
or result in the payment, acceleration or vesting of any payment, right or
benefit under any Benefit Plan.

 

(c) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code is the subject of a favorable determination or opinion letter from
the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ "). No such determination or opinion
letter has been revoked, and, to the Companys knowledge, revocation has not
been threatened. To the Companys knowledge, no such Benefit Plan has been
amended or operated since the date of its most recent determination or opinion
letter in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that would
adversely affect its qualification.

 

(d) Each Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered at all times in
accordance with its material terms. Each Benefit Plan, including any
associated trust or fund, has been established and administered in material
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other
applicable Law (including, where applicable, non-U.S. Law), and, to
the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred with respect to any
Benefit Plan that has subjected or could reasonably be expected to subject the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any liability or penalty under Section 502
of ERISA or to any tax under Chapter 43 of the Code. All filings and reports
with respect to each Benefit Plan required to have been submitted to the IRS,
the United States Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity have
been duly and timely submitted. 

(e) No Benefit Plan provides health or life insurance benefits following
retirement or other termination of employment, and neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation to provide any such benefits following
retirement or other termination of employment, in each case except for benefit
continuation coverage to the extent required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA.

(f) With respect to each Benefit Plan, no administrative investigation,
inquiry, audit or other proceeding by the IRS, U.S. Department of Labor or
other Governmental Entity, and no other lawsuit, claim, or other controversy,
other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course and proceedings
with respect to qualified domestic relations orders, is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened.

 

(g) With respect to each Benefit Plan, all contributions (including salary
reduction contributions), premiums and other payments (i) to the extent due,
have been timely made, and (ii) to the extent not yet due, have been
appropriately accrued on the books of the Company or, if applicable, any of
its Subsidiaries.

 

(h) Each Benefit Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code (" _Section 409A_ ")
has been operated in good faith compliance with Section 409A. No Benefit
Plan, which is subject to the requirements of Section 409A, violates such
requirements. All Company Options granted by the Company after October 3, 2004
or which vest or vested (in whole or in part) after December 31, 2004, have
(or, if already terminated, had) an exercise price that was not less than the
fair market value of the underlying stock as of the date such Company Option
was granted. The Company is not a party to, nor is otherwise obligated under,
any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the gross-up of
Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

 

(i) Except for the Benefit Plans listed in Section 4.9(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no Benefit Plan is subject to the Laws of a jurisdiction
other than the United States of America, whether or not United States Law also
applies. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianna Islands and the Virgin
Islands shall be considered jurisdictions other than the United States.



 

20 (j) Except for the Benefit Plans listed in Section 4.9(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each Benefit Plan and its related documentation or
agreement, summary plan description, or other written communication
distributed generally to employees by its terms expressly and adequately
reserves the right to amend and terminate such Benefit Plan, and each Plan
may be terminated without material liability to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate, except for vested benefits accrued through the date of termination
and the administrative and professional costs incurred in such transaction.
Except as listed in Section 4.9(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
Benefit Plan subject to ERISA includes in its assets in any securities issued
by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

 

(k) Except as listed in Section 4.9(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries: (i) has made any payments,
is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any agreement that could
obligate it to make any payments that will be treated as an "excess parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code or in the imposition of an excise Tax
under Code Section 4999 (or any corresponding provisions of state, local or
foreign Tax Law); or (ii) is a party to, nor is otherwise obligated under, any
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the gross-up of
the excise Tax imposed by Code Section 4999\.

(l) Neither the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries has made any payments
that have, or has been or is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement
or plan that have, resulted or will result, separately or in the aggregate, in
the payment of any compensation which would be subject to the deduction limit
imposed by Code Section 162(m).

(a) There is no action, claim, suit, proceeding or governmental investigation
pending against or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

of any Governmental Entity against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their securities or material assets or properties.

 

Section 4.11 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

and other approvals from Governmental Entities required to operate their
respective businesses as it is being conducted as of the Agreement Date
(collectively, the " _Permits_ ") and all of such Permits are in full force
and effect, except where the failure to obtain or have any such Permit would,
individually, or in the aggregate not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; and no proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened to revoke, suspend, cancel, terminate or adversely
modify any such Permit. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of, or in default under, any Law, in each case, applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets and
properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 4.11_ shall not

employment matters, or regulatory matters, which are the subject exclusively
of the representations and warranties in _Section 4.9_, _Section 4.13_,
_Section 4.15_, _Section 4.16_ and _Section 4.18_, respectively.

 

(b) None of the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries, any of their

any Governmental Entity where either the contribution, payment, commission,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT AND THE PURCHASER

 

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule of the Parent and the Purchaser
delivered to the Company concurrently herewith (the " _Parent Disclosure
Schedule_ ") (with specific reference to the section of this Agreement to
which the information stated in such Parent Disclosure Schedule relates;
_provided_ that (a) disclosure in any section of such Parent Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other Section of
this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable or relevant to such
other Section and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in such Parent Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or would have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect), the Parent and the Purchaser jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization_. Each of the Parent and the Purchaser is a
corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted. Each of the Parent and the Purchaser is duly qualified
or licensed to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly qualified or
licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any material
adverse change in, or material adverse effect on, the ability of the Parent
or the Purchaser to consummate the Transactions, including any such change or
effect that prevents, materially delays or materially impedes the Parents or
the Purchasers ability to consummate the Transactions. The Parent has made
available or will make available to the Company a copy of the articles of
incorporation or certificate of incorporation, as the case may be, and bylaws
or other equivalent organizational documents of the Parent and the Purchaser,
as currently in effect.

Section 5.2 _Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary Action_. Each of
the Parent and the Purchaser has the requisite corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Parent and the Purchaser of this
Agreement, approval and adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions have been duly and validly



 

28  authorized by all necessary action of the Parent and the Purchaser (other
than the written consent of the sole stockholder of the Purchaser which shall
occur promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement), and
no other corporate action on the part of the Parent or the Purchaser is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Parent and the
Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation by them of the Transactions.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Parent and the
Purchaser and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the Company, is a valid and binding obligation of each of the Parent
and the Purchaser, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its
terms, except that (a) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or
other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights
and remedies generally and (b) the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought.

Section 5.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Parent and the Purchaser do not, and the
performance by the Parent and the Purchaser of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Parent and the Purchaser of the Transactions will
not, (a) violate any provision of the articles of incorporation or
certificate of incorporation, as the case may be, or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) of the Parent or the Purchaser, (b) result in a
violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of
time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) under, any Contract to which the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their
properties or assets is bound, (c) violate any Law applicable to the Parent,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets or (d) other than
in connection with or compliance with (i) the DGCL, (ii) requirements under
other state corporation Laws, (iii) the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws, (iv)
Securities Exchange Rules, and (v) the Exchange Act, require on the part of
the Parent or the Purchaser any filing or registration with, notification to,
or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity; except, in
the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d), for such violations, breaches or
defaults that, or filings, registrations, notifications, authorizations,
consents or approvals the failure of which to make or obtain, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.4 _Disclosure Documents_.

 

(a) The Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, when filed, distributed or
disseminated, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and all other applicable Laws.

Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, at the time such Proxy
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to Company
Stockholders, as of the Special Meeting or at the Effective Time and (ii) in
the case of any Company Disclosure Document (other than the Proxy Statement),
at the time of the filing of such Company Disclosure Document or

Documents based upon information furnished to the Parent or the Purchaser in
writing by the Company specifically for use therein.

  

 

29 Section 5.5 _Operations and Ownership of the Purchaser_. The Purchaser was
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and has not
owned any assets, engaged in any business activities, conducted any operations
or incurred any liabilities or obligations other than in connection with the
Transactions. The authorized capital stock of the Purchaser consists of 1,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, 100 shares of which are
validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of the Purchaser is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly
by the Parent.

Section 5.6 _Financing; Sufficient Funds_. The Parent has delivered to the
Company a true, complete and correct signed copy of a debt commitment letter,

parent of Parent (" _CIFSA_ ") and Covidien plc, pursuant to which the lenders
party thereto have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, to provide or cause to be provided, the debt amounts set forth
therein to CIFSA (the " _Financing_ "). As of the Agreement Date, (a) the Debt
Financing Letter is in full force and effect, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of CIFSA and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto, and (b) the funding of the Financing is not subject to any
conditions or other contingencies other than those set forth in the Debt
Financing Letter. Subject to the terms and satisfaction of the conditions of
the Financing and this Agreement, the Financing, together with the cash and
marketable securities of CIFSA, will provide the Parent and the Purchaser with
sufficient immediately available funds to pay when due for all of the Shares
tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer and the aggregate Merger
Consideration. Prior to the Agreement Date, the Debt Financing Letter has not
been amended or modified, and as of the Agreement Date, the commitments
contained in the Debt Financing Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect. As of the Agreement Date, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties in Article IV and compliance by the Company
with its covenants set forth in this Agreement, (x) no event has occurred
or circumstance exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach of CIFSA under the Debt Financing Letter
and (y) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer set forth
on Annex A hereto, neither Parent nor Purchaser has any reason to believe
that CIFSA will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition to
funding of the Financing to be satisfied by it as set forth in the Debt
Financing Letter at or prior to the Share Acceptance Time. Except for fee
letters with respect to fees and related arrangements with respect to the
Financing (which do not relate to the conditionality of, or contain any
conditions precedent to, the funding of the Financing), there are no side
letters or other agreements, contracts or agreements related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Letter and delivered to the Company

Letter.

class or series of capital stock of the Parent is necessary to approve the

of its Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the Parents or
the Purchasers ability to consummate the Transactions. Neither the Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries, is subject to any Order against the Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or naming the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as a party
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have

Section 6.2 _Access to Information_. From the Agreement Date until the
earlier of the Share Acceptance Time and the termination of this Agreement,
the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to
officers, employees, counsel, investment bankers, accountants and
other authorized representatives (" _Representatives_ ") of the Parent and
the Purchaser reasonable access, in a manner not materially disruptive to the
operations of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal
business hours and upon



 

33  reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and, during such period, shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to such Representatives all information
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in each case as may reasonably be requested and necessary to
consummate the Transactions (and not to conduct further due diligence or
other investigation of the Company); _provided, however_ , that nothing herein
shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any
information to the Parent or the Purchaser if such disclosure would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, (a) violate applicable Law or the
provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain waivers of any such restrictions) or (b) waive attorney-client
privilege. Promptly after the Agreement Date, the Company shall provide to the
Parent a copy of each Company financial advisors fairness opinion, a summary
of the analysis underlying each fairness opinion and a copy of the relevant
portions of each Company financial advisors presentation to the Company Board
related thereto. That certain letter agreement, dated April 28, 2010, by and
between the Company and the Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")
shall apply with respect to information furnished hereunder by the Company,
its Subsidiaries and the Companys Representatives (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement).

 

Section 6.3 _Board Recommendation; Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.3(b)_, _6.3(e)_ and _6.3(f)_ , the Company and its
Subsidiaries will not, and will use best efforts to cause their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, from the Agreement Date until
the Share Acceptance Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VIII_  (i) initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage
or facilitate, or participate or engage in any negotiations, inquiries or
discussions with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) in connection with
any actual or potential Acquisition Proposal, disclose or furnish any
nonpublic information or data to any Person concerning the Companys business
or properties or afford any Person other than the Parent or its
Representatives access to its properties, books, or records, except as
required by a governmental demand for information, (iii) enter into or
execute, or propose to enter into or execute, any agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve, endorse, recommend or make or authorize
any statement, recommendation, or solicitation in support of any Acquisition
Proposal or any offer or proposal relating to an Acquisition Proposal other
than with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the Transactions (other than any
confidential statement, recommendation or solicitation by and among the
Company, the Company Board and their Representatives); _provided, however_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may refer
any third party to this  _Section 6.3_. The Company will, and will direct
its Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all
discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the Agreement Date
regarding any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time following the Agreement Date and prior to the Share Acceptance
Time the Company is contacted by any third party expressing an interest in
discussing an Acquisition Proposal or receives an Acquisition Proposal, in
each case, if the Company has not materially breached any provision of
_Section 6.3(a)_, the Company and the Company Board may participate or engage
in negotiations, inquiries or discussions (including, as a part
thereof, making any counterproposal) with, or disclose or furnish any
nonpublic information and data to, any Person or Persons (but only after any
such Person enters into a confidentiality agreement, on substantially the same
terms contained in, and no less restrictive than, the Confidentiality
Agreement, with the Company which may not provide for an exclusive right to
negotiate with the Company and may not restrict the Company from complying
with this _Section 6.3(b)_) making such contact or making such Acquisition
Proposal and their respective Representatives and potential sources of
financing, if, and only if, prior to the Share Acceptance Time the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Person or Persons have
submitted to the Company an Acquisition Proposal that is, or would reasonably
be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with counsel, that the failure to
participate in such negotiations, inquiries or discussions, disclose or
furnish such information, enter into any agreement

 



 

34  related to any Acquisition Proposal or accept any offer or proposal relating
to an Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to violate the
fiduciary duties of the Companys directors under applicable Law.

(c) The Company will as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) notify the Parent in
writing of the receipt by the Company of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
any request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the ordinary course of
business and, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify the Parent, in writing, of any
decision of the Company Board as to whether to consider any Acquisition
Proposal or to enter into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or to disclose or furnish nonpublic information with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person, which notice
shall be given as promptly as practicable after such determination was reached
(and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after such
determination was reached). The Company will (i) provide the Parent with
written notice setting forth all such information (including the identity of
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal) as is necessary to keep the
Parent informed of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal and of any material amendments thereto, (ii) promptly provide the
Parent a copy of all written information provided by or on behalf of such
Person or group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or provided by or
on behalf of the Company or its Representatives to such Person or group
(other than any information which has previously been made available to Parent
or its Representatives), and (iii) promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours of such determination) notify the Parent of any determination
by the Company Board that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent to the Agreement Date
that would restrict the Companys ability to provide to Parent the information
set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above, and, if the Company is a party to any
agreement that would prohibit the Company from providing such information to
Parent, prior to providing non-public information to, or engaging in
discussions or negotiations with, the counterparty to such agreement, the
Company will obtain approval from the counterparty to such agreement to allow
the Company to provide such information to Parent.

(d) Subject to _Sections 6.3(e)_ and _6.3(f)_ , unless and until this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i)(w)
withdraw, qualify, or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or
modify (other than in any confidential communication by and among the
Company, the Company Board and their Representatives), in a manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation, (x) make any public
disclosure inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation, or, fail to
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation following the public announcement of
an Acquisition Proposal within two (2) Business Days of a written request by
Parent; (y) approve, adopt, or recommend, or propose to approve, adopt, or
recommend (other than in any confidential communication by and among the
Company, the Company Board and their Representatives), any Acquisition
Proposal or (z) in the event of a tender offer or exchange offer for any
outstanding Shares, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer
or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders within ten (10) Business Days of
the commencement thereof (any action described in clauses (w)-(z) being
referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company to execute
or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement, or other similar agreement,
arrangement, or understanding (x) constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal or (y) requiring it to abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the
Transactions.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Share Acceptance Time, the
Company Board may, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor (in the case
of clause (i) below) that (i) (x) a written Acquisition Proposal received by
the Company 



 

35  constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties of the Companys
directors under applicable Law, or (ii) in the absence of an Acquisition
Proposal, due to events occurring after the Agreement Date, the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to violate the fiduciary duties
of the Companys directors under applicable Law, (1) make a Change of
Recommendation, or (2) in the case of clause (i) above, terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (2) and any purported termination pursuant to
the foregoing clause (2) shall be void and of no force or effect unless, in
advance of or concurrently with such termination, the Company (A) pays the
Termination Fee as required by _Section 8.2_, (B) simultaneously with such
termination enters into a merger agreement, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, purchase agreement or other similar agreement relating
to an Acquisition Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") and
(C) terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_; _provided,
further_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Change of Recommendation
pursuant to the foregoing clause (1), or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the foregoing clause (2) unless (A) the Company shall have provided prior
written notice to the Parent at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the
" _Notice Period_ ") of its intention to take such action with respect to such
Superior Proposal or otherwise make a Change of Recommendation, which notice
shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party marking such Superior Proposal) or the
reasons for such Change of Recommendation in the absence of a Superior
Proposal, as the case may be, (B) prior to effecting such Change
of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, and shall direct its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with the Parent in good faith (to the extent the Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and (C) following the Notice Period (and giving effect to any
proposed adjustments to the terms of this Agreement) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor (in the case of clause (i) below) that (i) such
Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal or (ii) the failure to make
such Change of Recommendation would still violate the fiduciary duties of the
Companys directors under applicable Law. In the event of any material
revisions to the Superior Proposal or material changes to the facts and
circumstances necessitating such Change of Recommendation after the start of
the Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section
6.3(e)_ with respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period shall
be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new notice. Any Change of
Recommendation shall not change the approval of the Company Board for purposes
of causing any state takeover statute or other state Law to be inapplicable
to the Transactions, including each of the Offer and the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by the Tender and Voting Agreement.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer, proposal or effort made by any
Person or Persons other than the Parent, the Purchaser or any Affiliate
thereof to acquire, other than as contemplated by this Agreement, (x)
beneficial ownership (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of
20% or more of the Shares pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other
business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer or
exchange offer or similar transaction or series of related transactions
involving the Company or (y) 20% or more of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Acquisition Proposal (substituting the
term "50%" for the term "20%" in each instance where such term appears
therein) that the Company Board determines, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and after taking into account
all of



 

36  the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including any
termination or break-up fees and conditions to consummation) and all
financial, legal, regulatory, and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal,
to be more favorable to the Company and the Company Stockholders than the
Transactions.

 

Section 6.4 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) continue
certain Benefit Plans, (ii) permit employees of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries who remain in the employment with Parent or Surviving Corporation
or their respective subsidiaries following the Effective Time (" _Continuing
Employees_ ") while they remain so employed by Parent or Surviving Corporation
or their respective subsidiaries, and as applicable, their eligible
dependents, to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs or
policies (including without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any severance, vacation, sick,
personal time off plans or programs and excluding any equity compensation
or bonus plans, programs, agreements or arrangements) of Parent or its
Affiliates, or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) and (ii), in all cases, such
employee benefit plans, programs or policies shall be substantially comparable
in the aggregate to those provided to such employees immediately preceding
the Effective Time.

(b) From the Effective Time until the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
Continuing Employees while they remain so employed by Parent or Surviving
Corporation or their respective subsidiaries with base salary that is not
materially less than the base salary in effect for each such Continuing
Employee immediately preceding the Effective Time. From the Effective Time,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
Continuing Employees with equity compensation and target bonus opportunity
that is equal to that provided for similarly situated employees of Parent and
its subsidiaries.

 

(c) To the extent Parent elects to have Employees and their eligible
dependents participate in its or its Affiliates employee benefit plans,
program or policies following the Effective Time and subject to applicable Law
and the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to, recognize the prior service
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including prior service with
predecessor employers where such prior service is recognized by the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of
each Employee in connection with all employee benefit plans, programs or
policies of Parent or its Affiliates in which Employees are eligible to
participate for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
determination of level of benefits (but not (A) for purposes of vesting in
stock options and other equity awards, (B) for the purposes of benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or (C) to the extent that such
recognition would result in duplication of benefits). 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries to, cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group
health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents were not subject to such
preexisting conditions and limitations and eligibility waiting periods under
the comparable Plans as of the time immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 

(e) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may be
provided to any employee by Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
under any benefit plan which Company, Parent or Surviving Corporation may
maintain.

Section 6.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of the Parent and
the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be
acceptable to the Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor the Parent
(nor any of their respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release
or make any other public



 

37  announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior agreement of the other party, except as may be required by Law or by any
Securities Exchange Rule, in which case the party proposing to issue such
press release or make such public announcement shall use reasonable best
efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before making any such
public announcements; _provided_ that the Company will no longer be required
to obtain the prior agreement of or consult with the Parent in connection with
any such press release or public announcement if the Company Board has
withdrawn its Recommendation or in connection with any such press release
or public announcement pursuant to _Section 6.3(f)_, _provided_ , that the
Company, in all such events, shall provide Parent with a copy of any such
press release or public announcement a reasonable time in advance of
public dissemination.

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who at
any time prior to the Effective Time (i) were directors or officers of the
Company or any of its present or former Subsidiaries or corporate parents or
(ii) served as treasurer of the Company (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in connection
with actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the Transactions) to the fullest extent that the Surviving
Corporation is permitted by Law, and the Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent that the Surviving Corporation is permitted by Law. The certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the
provisions with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as
amended, restated and in effect on the Agreement Date, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless
such modification is required by Law.

(b) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this
_Section 6.6_, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall keep in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions
of, any agreement in effect as of the Agreement Date between or among the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party providing for the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party.

 

(c) The Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six
(6) years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties and any
other employees, agents or other individuals otherwise covered by such
insurance policies prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Insured
Parties_ ") with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the Transactions), so long as the annual premium therefore
would not be in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the last annual
premium paid prior to the Effective Time (the " _Maximum Premium_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may,
prior to the Effective Time, purchase a so-called "Reporting Tail Endorsement"
with an annual premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, in which case,
provided that the Parent causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain such
Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time, the Parent shall be relieved from its other
obligations under this _Section 6.6_.

 

(d) This _Section 6.6_ is intended to benefit the Insured Parties and the
Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
the Parent, the Purchaser, the Company and the Surviving Corporation. The
Parent hereby guarantees the payment and performance by the Surviving
Corporation of the indemnification and other obligations pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_ and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(e) After the Effective Time, the Parent guarantees the full performance of
the Surviving Corporation of its covenants and obligations set forth in this
Section 6.6.



 

38 Section 6.7 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company has used and shall use its
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no "control
share acquisition", "fair price", "business combination" or other anti-
takeover Law is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the Merger, any of
the other Transactions or the transactions contemplated by the Tender and
Voting Agreement and (b) if any such anti-takeover Laws are or become
applicable to the Offer, the Merger, any of the other Transactions or the
transactions contemplated by the Tender and Voting Agreement, to take all
action necessary so that the Offer, the Merger, any of the other Transactions
and the transactions contemplated by the Tender and Voting Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such anti-takeover Laws on
the Offer, the Merger, any of the other Transactions or the transactions
contemplated by the Tender and Voting Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its obligations
under Section 220 of the DGCL.

 

Section 6.8 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto agree to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act and to make all other filings required by applicable
foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as
practicable and in any event prior to the expiration of any applicable legal
deadline (provided that the filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act will be made within ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement
Date) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be required pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law. The parties shall also consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
in connection with proceedings under or relating to any such Antitrust Laws.
Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree (i) to give each
other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity
relating to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) to the extent practicable, to give each
other reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral communications with
any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws, (iii) if any
Governmental Entity initiates a substantive oral communication regarding any
Antitrust Laws, to promptly notify the other party of such communication, and
(iv) to provide each other with copies of all written communications from any
Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any such disclosures or
provision of copies by one party to the other may be made on an
outside counsel basis if appropriate. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parent agrees, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, to use reasonable best efforts to take any and
all actions necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals
required under or in connection with the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended,
the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and
any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or the significant impediment of
effective competition (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ "), and to enable
all waiting periods under applicable Antitrust Laws to expire, and to use
reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
applicable Antitrust Laws asserted by any Governmental Entity, in each case,
to cause the Merger and the other Transactions to occur prior to the End
Date, including but not limited to (x) promptly complying with or modifying
any requests for additional information (including any second request) by any
Governmental Entity, and (y) contesting, defending and appealing any
threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,
decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would
adversely affect the ability of any party hereto to consummate the
Transactions and taking any and all other actions to prevent the entry,
enactment or promulgation thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 6.8(a)_, in no event shall Parent or the Purchaser be required
to offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any
of the capital stock, assets, rights, products or businesses of the Parent and
its Subsidiaries. Each party shall bear its own expenses and costs incurred
in connection with any HSR Act filings or other such competition filings and
submissions which may be required by such party for the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions pursuant to this Agreement.



 

39 (b) Subject to the terms hereof, and except with regard to the Antitrust Laws
which shall be governed by _Section 6.8(a)_, the Company, the Parent and the
Purchaser shall, and the Parent and the Company shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, each use their reasonable best efforts to: 

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable;

 

(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders
and send any notices, in each case, which are required to be obtained, made or
sent by the Company or the Parent or any of their Subsidiaries in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ that in connection therewith none
of the Company or its Subsidiaries will be required to (nor, without the prior
written consent of the Parent, will) make or agree to make any payment
or accept any material conditions or obligations, including amendments to
existing conditions and obligations;

 

(iii) obtain a consent or waiver from Silicon Valley Bank (the " _Bank_ ")
pursuant to Section 9.7 of that certain Loan and Security Agreement, dated
June 28, 2006, by and among the Bank and certain of the Companys
Subsidiaries, as amended (the " _Loan Agreement_ ") that sets forth that the
Purchasers acceptance for payment and payment for all Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall not be
considered an "Event of Default" under Section 8.2(a) of the Loan Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ that if such consent or waiver cannot be obtained by
the Company within five (5) Business Days after the Agreement Date, then the
Company shall provide notice to the Bank pursuant to Section 2.1.10 of the
Loan Agreement of the Companys intent to prepay all amounts owed under the
Loan Agreement on the Initial Expiration Date, and the Company shall pay all
such amounts on the Initial Expiration Date;

 

(iv) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings and notifications,
and thereafter make any other submissions and applications with respect to
this Agreement and the Transactions required under any applicable statute,
law, rule or regulation; and

 

(v) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company and the Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, submissions, applications and requests. The
Company and the Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to furnish
to each other (on an outside counsel basis if appropriate) all information
required for any filing, submission, application or request to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable statute, law, rule or
regulation in connection with the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parent and the Company agree that nothing contained in this _Section
6.8(b)_ shall modify, limit or otherwise affect their respective rights and
responsibilities under _Section 6.8(a)_.

 

Section 6.9 _Financing_.

 

(a) The Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to,
at Parents sole cost and expense, cooperate with the Parent and take such
actions as the Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
procurement and consummation of the Financing (or any Alternative Financing);
provided that nothing contained in this Section 6.9 shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable, to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Letter and
to satisfy the conditions for obtaining the Financing, (ii) enter into
definitive financing agreements with respect to the Financing so that such
agreements are in effect no later than the Share



 

40  Acceptance Time and (iii) consummate the Financing on or prior to the Share
Acceptance Time. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the
event that Parent has been notified by the lenders party to the Debt
Financing Letter that any portion of the Financing will not be available on
the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing Letter, the Parent
shall promptly notify the Company in writing and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (" _Alternative Financing_ ") in
an amount at least sufficient to, in addition to the cash and marketable
securities of CIFSA and the portion of the Financing that remains available
on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing Letter, pay
when due for all of the Shares tendered and not properly withdrawn in the
Offer and the aggregate Merger Consideration. Parent shall not agree to any
amendments or modifications to, or waivers of, any condition or other
material provision under the Debt Financing Letter without the prior consent
of the Company if such amendment, modification or waiver would impose new or
additional conditions to the receipt of the Financing or otherwise amend,
modify or waive any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a
manner would reasonably be expected to cause any delay in the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Annex I or Article VII. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Parent nor the Purchaser shall be required to (i) waive
any conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I or Article VII, (ii)
consent to any changes to the Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter or (iii) accept Alternative Financing on terms less favorable to the
Parent and the Purchaser in the aggregate than the Financing would have been.
In the event the Parent obtains Alternative Financing, the provisions of
this Section 6.9 shall apply to such Alternative Financing to the same extent
it applies to the Financing. The Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its reasonable
best efforts to finalize the Financing or arrange any Alternative Financing
in accordance with this Section 6.9.

Section 6.10  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Share Acceptance Time, the
Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition of equity securities of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person
for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be an exempt transaction
for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

Section 6.11 _Tax Matters_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all real and
personal property, transfer, documentary, sales, use registration, value
added, stamp duty and other similar Taxes incurred in connection with the
Transactions shall be borne by the Parent. For the avoidance of doubt,
transfer Taxes shall not include any Taxes measured in whole or in part by
net income.

Section 6.12 _Obligations of the Purchaser_. The Parent shall cause
the Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement. The Parent hereby guarantees the payment by the Purchaser of
any amounts payable by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 6.13 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or the
Purchaser, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or the Purchaser, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.

 

Section 6.14 _Delisting_. The Company agrees to cause to be taken all actions
necessary to (a) delist the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market
LLC and (b) to terminate the registration of the Company Common Stock under
the Exchange Act; _provided_ that such delisting or termination shall not be
effective until after the Effective Time. The Parent will use all reasonable
best efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to file with the SEC (a) a
Form 25 on the Closing Date and (b) a Form 15 on the first Business Day that
is at least ten (10) days after the date the Form 25 is filed (such period
between the Form 25 filing date and



 

41  the Form 15 filing date, the " _Delisting Period_ "). If the Surviving
Corporation is reasonably likely to be required to file any reports pursuant
to the Exchange Act during the Delisting Period, the Company will deliver to
the Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing a
substantially final draft of any such reports reasonably likely to be required
to be filed during the Delisting Period (" _Post-Closing SEC Reports_ "). The
Post-Closing SEC Reports provided by the Company pursuant to this Section 6.14
will (i) not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading and (ii) comply in all material respects with
the provisions of applicable Laws. 

Section 6.15 _401(k)_. Except with the prior written consent of the Parent,
during the period from the Agreement Date to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not (a) make any discretionary contribution to the Companys 401(k)
plan, other than employer matching contributions at the rate in effect
immediately prior to the Agreement Date, or (ii) make any required
contribution to the Companys 401(k) plan in Shares. If requested by the
Parent in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled Expiration
Date, the Company shall terminate the Companys 401(k) plan immediately prior
to such scheduled Expiration Date.

Section 6.16 _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall deliver to the Parent
(a) a certification in a form tendered by Parent to the Company dated not more
than thirty (30) days prior to the date of the consummation of the Offer and
(b) to the extent necessary in light of the certification delivered pursuant
to clause (a), an additional certification in a form tendered by Parent to the
Company dated not more than thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time, in
each case signed by the Company and to the effect that the Shares are not
"United States real property interests" within the meaning of section 897 of
the Code; _provided, however_ , that the Companys failure to provide such
certification shall not be a condition to Closing under this Agreement, and
the Parent shall be entitled to withhold from the Merger Consideration and pay
over to the appropriate Taxing Authorities the amount required to be withheld
under section 1445 of the Code.

 

Section 6.17 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Agreement Date, the Company
(acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) has taken
all such steps as may be required to cause any and all employment
compensation, severance and employee benefit agreements and arrangements
entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries or contemplated hereby with
any of their respective officers, directors or employees to be approved as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d10(d)
under the Exchange Act. The Company has provided Parent with copies of all
such actions.

 

Section 6.18 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give the Parent, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior
to the Share Acceptance Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement is
intended to give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Parents or its Subsidiaries operations. Prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

Section 6.19 _Operations of the Purchaser_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Purchaser shall not engage in any other business activities and shall not have
incurred any liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated herein.

 

Section 6.20 _Ownership of Shares_. Prior to the Share Acceptance Time, none
of the Parent or the Purchaser or their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries
shall acquire any Shares except pursuant to this Agreement.

provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.2 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, the
Parent or the Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
_Section 7.1_ to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys

the Transactions, as required by and subject to  _Section 6.8_.

further revisions, (y) the Purchaser terminates or makes any change to
the Offer in breach of the terms of this Agreement or (z) the Purchaser shall

shall be no liability on the part of the Parent, the Purchaser or the Company
or their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
Representatives, agents or advisors other than, with respect to the Parent,
the Purchaser and the Company, the obligations pursuant to this _Section
8.2_, and _Article IX_ , the last sentence of _Section 6.2_ and _Section
6.5_; _provided, however_ , that except as set forth in  _Section 8.2(b)_
nothing contained in this _Section 8.2_ shall relieve the Parent, the
Purchaser or the Company from liability for fraud or willful breach of their
respective covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement. 



 

44 (b) If

8.1(c)(ii)_,

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_,

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Parent pursuant to _Section

and prior to the date of termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal
that remains outstanding and not withdrawn as of the date of termination of

a Qualifying Transaction or consummates a Qualifying Transaction (in each case
regardless of whether the Qualifying Transaction is the Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (y)),

then the Company shall pay to the Parent a termination fee of $83,650,522 in
cash (the " _Termination Fee_ "),

(A) concurrently with any termination pursuant to  _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_,

(B) within one (1) Business Day after termination pursuant to  _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ or pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ if Parent is entitled to the

(C) within one (1) Business Day after the Company executes and delivers a
definitive agreement with respect to (or, if earlier, consummates) a
Qualifying Transaction as set forth in _Section 8.2(b)(iv);_

it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Upon payment of the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, the Company shall have no further liability
to the Parent or the Purchaser with respect to this Agreement or the
Transaction, _provided_ that nothing herein shall release the Company from
liability for intentional breach or fraud. All payments contemplated by this
_Section 8.2(b)_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Parent and shall be reduced by any
amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Law in

payment, the Company shall indemnify the Parent for its fees and expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit

merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital

Company or (ii) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or

Section 9.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is

specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal
and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall
be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to
replace such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a valid,
legal and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable term.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed

to be made and performed entirely therein without giving effect to the

and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any United
States federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state
court in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, (b) agrees 



 

47  that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions in any court other than a United States federal or state court
sitting in the State of Delaware; _provided_ that each of the parties shall
have the right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a
judgment entered by any United States federal court located in the State of

service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts
referred to in _Section 9.9_ in any such action or proceeding by mailing

service of process on the other party by any other legally available method.

 

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any breach
of this Agreement, the other parties would be irreparably and immediately
harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly
agreed that (i) each party hereby waives, in any action for specific
performance, any and all defenses in any action for specific performance,
including the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law and (ii) each party shall
be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at
Law or in equity, to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement and
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement in
any action instituted in accordance with _Section 9.9_, in each case without
the posting of a bond or undertaking or other security as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief.

(b) Notwithstanding the parties rights to specific performance or
injunctive relief or both pursuant to _Section 9.11(a)_, each party may
pursue any other remedy available to it at Law or in equity, including
monetary damages; provided, that it is understood and agreed that claims for
monetary damages following termination of this Agreement shall be (i) limited
to those arising from or relating to any intentional breach of this Agreement
or fraud prior to such termination and (ii) subject to the penultimate
sentence of _Section 8.2(b)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, no party hereto shall be permitted to make any claim or commence
any action, suit or proceeding seeking monetary damages against any other
party hereto in connection with or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions, provided that the foregoing shall be without prejudice to the
right of any party to seek such monetary damages following such
termination in accordance with, and subject to the limitations set forth in,
this Agreement.

from time to time.



 

53 Annex II

 

FORM OF TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT

 

TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT

 

THIS TENDER AND VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated June 1, 2010, is
entered into between Covidien Group S.a.r.l., a Luxembourg company ("
_Parent_ "), COV Delaware Corporation, a Delaware corporation and direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and 
, (" _Stockholder_ "), with respect to [ ] shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share (the " _Shares_ "), of ev3 Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

 _W I T N E S S E T H:_

 

WHEREAS, the Parent, the Purchaser and the Company have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be
amended or supplemented, other than to lower the price to be paid in the Offer
or Merger, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") pursuant to which the Purchaser has
agreed to make a cash tender offer as described therein and thereafter merge
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") with the result that the Company
becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent;

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Stockholder beneficially owns and has the
power to dispose of the Shares and has the power to vote such Shares;

WHEREAS, the Parent and the Purchaser desire to enter into this Agreement in
connection with their efforts to consummate the acquisition of the Company;

WHEREAS, Stockholder wishes to convey to Parent and Purchaser pursuant to and
subject to the terms of this Agreement beneficial ownership of only [
] of the Shares (such number of Shares being referred to herein as the
"Permissible Number");

WHEREAS, capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined have the
meaning given to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in contemplation of the foregoing and in consideration of the
mutual agreements, covenants, representations and warranties contained herein
and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

1\. _Certain Covenants_.

 

Section 1.1 _Lock-Up_. Subject to Section 1.5, except as contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, Stockholder hereby covenants and agrees that between the
date hereof and the Termination Date, Stockholder will not (a) directly or
indirectly, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, tender, encumber or
otherwise dispose of or limit its right to vote in any manner any of the
Shares, or agree to do any of the foregoing, or (b) take any action which
would have the effect of preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing
its obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
connection with any transfer not involving or relating to any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), Stockholder may transfer any or
all of the Shares to any Affiliate, subsidiary, partner or member of
Stockholder;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in any such case, prior to and as
a condition to the effectiveness of such transfer, (A) each Person to which
any of such Shares or any interest in any of such Shares is or may be
transferred shall have executed and delivered to the Parent and the Purchaser
a counterpart to this Agreement pursuant to which such Person shall be bound
by all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and (B) this Agreement
shall be the legal, valid and binding agreement of such Person, enforceable
against such person in accordance with its terms.



 

54 Section 1.2 _No Solicitation_. Between the date hereof and the Termination
Date, the Stockholder shall not, and shall not authorize or permit, any
director, officer, agent, representative, employee, affiliate, advisor,
attorney, accountant or associate of Stockholder or those of its subsidiaries
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly, take any
action, in its or their capacity as a stockholder of the Company, that the
Company is prohibited from taking pursuant to Section 6.3 of the Merger
Agreement.

 

Section 1.3 _Certain Events_. This Agreement and the obligations hereunder
will attach to the Shares and will be binding upon any person to which legal
or beneficial ownership of any or all of the Shares passes, whether by
operation of Law or otherwise, including without limitation, the Stockholders
successors or assigns. This Agreement and the obligations hereunder will also
attach to any additional shares of common stock issued to or acquired by the
Stockholder, but such additional shares shall not be Optioned Shares for
purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 1.4 _Grant of Proxy; Voting Agreement_.

 

(a) The Stockholder has revoked or terminated any proxies, voting agreements
or similar arrangements previously given or entered into with respect to the
Shares and hereby grants Parent until the Termination Date a limited
irrevocable proxy to vote the Permissible Number of Shares as to which
Stockholder has voting power for Stockholder and in Stockholders name, place
and stead, at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the
Company, as applicable, or at any adjournment thereof, whether before or after
the Share Acceptance Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), solely for the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Merger. The Parent
hereby acknowledges that the proxy granted hereby shall not be effective for
any other purpose. The parties acknowledge and agree that neither the Parent,
nor the Parents successors, assigns, subsidiaries, divisions, employees,
officers, directors, stockholders, agents and affiliates shall owe any duty
to, whether in law or otherwise, or incur any liability of any kind
whatsoever, including without limitation, with respect to any and all claims,
losses, demands, causes of action, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) and compensation of any kind or nature whatsoever to the
Stockholder in connection with or as a result of any voting by the Parent of
the Permissible Number of Shares subject to the irrevocable proxy hereby
granted to the Parent at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of
the Company for the purpose set forth herein.

 

(b) During the term of this Agreement, Stockholder agrees to vote the Shares
as to which it has not given a proxy pursuant to paragraph (a) above in favor
of or give its consent to, as applicable, a proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and thereby approve the Merger at any annual or special meeting of
the stockholders of the Company. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing
grant to the Parent of the irrevocable proxy on the Optioned Shares, if the
Parent elects not to exercise its rights to vote the Permissible Number of
Shares pursuant to the irrevocable proxy, Stockholder also agrees to vote
the Permissible Number of Shares in favor of or give its consent to, as
applicable, a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and thereby approve the
Merger at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company.

 

(c) This irrevocable proxy shall not be terminated by any act of the
Stockholder or by operation of law (including, without limiting the
foregoing, by the dissolution or liquidation of any corporation or
partnership). If between the execution hereof and the Termination Date, if any
corporation or partnership holding the Shares should be dissolved or
liquidated, or if any other such similar event or events shall occur before
the Termination Date, certificates representing the Shares shall be delivered
by or on behalf of Stockholder in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement and this Agreement, and actions taken by the Parent
hereunder shall be as valid as if such dissolution, liquidation or other
similar event or events had not occurred, regardless of whether or not the
Parent has received notice of such dissolution, liquidation or other event.

Section 1.5 _Tender of Shares_. Stockholder agrees, in exchange for
the consideration described in the Merger Agreement, to tender the Shares to
the Purchaser in the Offer not later than five (5) Business Days following the
commencement of the Offer (such Shares being referred to herein as 



 

55  the " _Tender Shares_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Stockholder may
withdraw any Tender Shares so tendered above at any time following the
termination or expiration of the Offer without Purchaser purchasing all
shares of common stock tendered pursuant to the Offer in accordance with its
terms; _provided_ , _further_ , that Stockholder shall not have any obligation
under this Section 1.5 to tender the Tender Shares into the Offer if that
tender could cause the Stockholder to incur liability under Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act.

 

Section 1.6 _Option_.

 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Stockholder
hereby grants to Parent an irrevocable option (the " _Option_ ") to purchase
all of the right, title and interest of Stockholder in and to the Permissible
Number of Stockholders Shares (the "Optioned Shares") with a price per share
equal to the Offer Price. Parent may exercise the Option in whole, but not in
part, if, but only if, (i) the Purchaser has acquired shares of common stock
pursuant to the Offer and (ii) Stockholder has failed to tender into the Offer
at least the Permissible Number of Shares or shall have withdrawn the tender
of a number of Shares equal to or greater than the Permissible Number in
breach of this Agreement. The Parent may exercise the Option at any time
within the sixty (60) days following the date when such Option first becomes
exercisable.

(b) In the event that the Parent is entitled to and wishes to exercise
the Option, the Parent shall send a written notice to Stockholder specifying
the place and the date for the closing of such purchase, which date shall be
not more than sixty (60) days after the date of such notice; provided that in
the event that prior notification to, or approval of, any Governmental Entity
is required in connection with the exercise of the Option or there shall be in
effect any preliminary or final injunction or other order issued by any
Governmental Entity prohibiting the exercise of the Option, the period of
time during which the date of the closing may be fixed shall be extended until
the tenth (10th) day following the last date on which all required approvals
shall have been obtained, all required waiting periods shall have expired or
been terminated and any such prohibition shall have been vacated, terminated
or waived.

 

(c) At the closing of the purchase of Stockholders Optioned Shares pursuant
to exercise of the Option, simultaneously with the payment by the Parent of
the purchase price for Stockholders Optioned Shares, such Stockholder shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Purchaser certificates representing
the Optioned Shares duly endorsed to the Parent or accompanied by stock
powers or other transfer documents duly executed by the Company in blank,
together with any necessary stock transfer stamps properly affixed, free and
clear of all Liens.

 

(d) The Parent, the Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Section 1.6 to Stockholder such amounts as are required to be withheld
under the Code or the Treasury Regulations thereunder or any other Tax Law.

 

Section 1.7 _Public Announcement_. Stockholder shall consult with the Parent
before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement without the approval of
the Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except as may be required by Law, including any filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "). This Section 1.7
shall terminate and be null and void upon the earlier of (a) the Termination
Date and (b) consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 1.8 _Disclosure_. Stockholder hereby authorizes the Parent and the
Purchaser to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required
by the SEC, The Nasdaq Stock Market or any other national securities exchange
and in the Offer Documents and, if necessary, the Proxy Statement (including
all documents and schedules filed with the SEC in connection with either of
the foregoing), Stockholders identity and ownership of the Shares and the
nature of Stockholders commitments, arrangements and

 



 

56  understandings under this Agreement. The Parent and the Purchaser hereby
authorize Stockholder to make such disclosure or filings as may be required by
the SEC or The Nasdaq Stock Market or any other national securities exchange.

2\. _Representations and Warranties of Stockholder_. Stockholder hereby
represents and warrants to the Parent and the Purchaser, as of the date
hereof and as of the date the Purchaser purchases Tender Shares from
Stockholder pursuant to the Offer, that:

 

Section 2.1 _Ownership_. As of the date hereof, Stockholder holds of record or
beneficially the Shares set forth on _Schedule I_ , in each case, except as
set forth on _Schedule I_ , free and clear of all liabilities, claims, liens,
options, proxies, charges, participations and encumbrances of any kind or
character whatsoever, other than those arising under the securities laws or
under the Companys governance documents (collectively, " _Liens_ "). At the
time the Purchaser purchases Tender Shares from Stockholder pursuant to the
Offer, Stockholder will transfer and convey to the Purchaser good and
marketable title to the Shares included in the Shares, free and clear of all
Liens created by or arising through Stockholder.

 

Section 2.2 _Authorization_. Stockholder has all requisite power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and has the power to vote and the power to dispose of the
Shares with no restrictions on its voting rights or rights of disposition
pertaining thereto, except as set forth in this Agreement or that may exist
pursuant to the securities laws. Stockholder has duly executed and delivered
this Agreement and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding agreement of
Stockholder, enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent enforceability may be limited by the effect of applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and the effect of general
principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding at Law or in equity.

 

Section 2.3 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(a) require the Stockholder to file or register with, or obtain any permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity other than
filings with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, or (b) violate, or cause a
breach of or default under, or conflict with any contract, agreement or
understanding, any Law binding upon the Stockholder, except for such
violations, breaches, defaults or conflicts which are not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Stockholders ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement. As of
the date hereof, no proceedings are pending which, if adversely determined,
will have a material adverse effect on the Stockholders ability to vote or
dispose of any of the Shares.

 

Section 2.4 _Stockholder Has Adequate Information_. Stockholder is a
sophisticated seller with respect to the Shares and has adequate information
concerning the business and financial condition of the Company to make an
informed decision regarding the sale of the Shares and has independently and
without reliance upon either the Purchaser or the Parent and based on such
information as Stockholder has deemed appropriate, made its own analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges that neither
the Purchaser nor the Parent has made and neither makes any representation
or warranty, whether express or implied, of any kind or character except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Stockholder acknowledges that the
agreements contained herein with respect to the Shares held by Stockholder are
irrevocable (prior to the Termination Date).

Section 2.5 _No Setoff_. The Stockholder has no liability or
obligation related to or in connection with the Shares other than the
obligations to the Parent and the Purchaser as set forth in this Agreement.

the date hereof that:

corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

57  The Parent and the Purchaser have duly executed and delivered this Agreement
and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding agreement of each of the
Parent and the Purchaser, enforceable against each of the Parent and the
Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability
may be limited by the effect of applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity.

 

Section 3.2 _No Violation_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
violate, or cause a breach of or default under, any contract or agreement, any
statute or law, or any judgment, decree, order, regulation or rule of any
Governmental Entity, except for such violations, breaches or defaults which
are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on either the
Parents or the Purchasers ability to satisfy its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

4\. _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Termination
Date. The respective representations and warranties of Stockholder, the Parent
and the Purchaser contained herein shall not be deemed waived or otherwise
affected by any investigation made by the other party hereto. 

5\. _Specific Performance_. Stockholder acknowledges that the Parent and the
Purchaser will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate
remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of
Stockholder which are contained in this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed
that, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to the Parent
and the Purchaser upon the breach by Stockholder of such covenants and
agreements, the Parent and the Purchaser shall have the right to obtain
injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of such
covenants or agreements or otherwise to obtain specific performance of any of
such covenants or agreements.

6\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

Section 6.1 _Term_. This Agreement and all obligations hereunder shall
terminate upon the earlier of (a) the Effective Time, (b) the End Date, (c)

consideration to be paid in the Offer or in the form of Merger Consideration,
and (d) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms

set forth in this Section 6.1 shall relieve any party from liability for any
willful breach of this Agreement prior to termination hereof, and (ii) the
provisions of this Article 6 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

Company or any of Company Subsidiaries or in such Stockholders capacity as a

herein will be construed to limit or affect any action or inaction by the
Stockholder or any Representative of the Stockholder, as applicable, serving
on the Company Board or on the board of directors of any Subsidiary of the

Company or any employee benefit plan or trust, acting in such persons
