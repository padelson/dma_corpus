arising out of or attributable to): (a) the current or past presence at any
part of the Leased Transmitter Sites of Hazardous Materials; (b) the current
or past release or threatened release into the environment from the Leased

Sites or the businesses or Purchased Assets of Seller; (d) any violation of
Environmental Laws at any part of the Leased Transmitter Sites arising from

has been duly issued all permits, licenses, certificates and approvals
required under any Environmental Law to operate the Purchased Assets as they
are currently operated.   4.11.4. Seller has made available to Purchaser all
environmental assessments, reports, audits and other documents in its
possession or under its control that relate to the Leased Transmitter Sites
or Seller\'s compliance with Environmental Laws with respect to the Purchased
Assets.   4.11.5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
this Section 4.11 sets forth Seller\'s exclusive representations and
warranties with respect to the environmental condition of the Purchased
Assets, Seller\'s compliance with Environmental Laws, Hazardous Materials,
Environmental Laws or other environmental matters. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, Purchaser hereby waives and releases all claims
against Seller arising under Environmental Laws, including any statutory
rights to contribution, with respect to the Purchased Assets.  4.12.
Litigation.   Except as set forth on Schedule 4.12, there is no Order of any
court or Governmental Authority and no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, judicial,   -12-    administrative or otherwise that is
pending or, to Seller\'s knowledge, threatened against or affecting the
Stations which, if adversely determined would have a Material Adverse Effect
or which challenges the validity of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.  4.13. Contracts and Agreements.   Seller is not in
default in any respect under any of the Assumed Contracts, and, as of the
Closing Date, Seller will have paid all sums and performed in all material
respects all obligations under the Assumed Contracts which are required to be
paid or performed prior to the Closing Date.  4.14. Business Records.  
Seller has, and after the Closing, Purchaser will have, the right to use the
Business Records included in the Purchased Assets, free and clear of
any royalty or other payment obligations.  4.15. Third Party Consents.  
Except as set forth in Section 4.4, the only consents from any Person which
are required to be obtained by Seller in connection with the execution
and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby are set forth on Schedule 4.15 (the "Third
Party Consents").  4.16. Finders and Brokers.   Except for Jorgenson
Broadcast Brokerage (the fees and expenses of which shall be borne solely by
Seller), no person has as a result of any agreement entered into by Seller
any valid claim against any of the parties hereto for a brokerage commission,
finder\'s fee or other like payment.  4.17. Disclaimer of Warranties;
Limitations of Warranties.   EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER MAKES NO
WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER OF MERCHANTABILITY, SUITABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR QUALITY AS TO THE PURCHASED ASSETS, OR
ANY PART THEREOF, OR AS TO THE CONDITION OR WORKMANSHIP THEREOF, OR THE
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT.  
-13-    4.18. Registration Statement and Information Statement.   None
of the information to be supplied by Seller for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Registration Statement or the information statement included
therein (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, and including
all information incorporated by reference therein, the "Information
Statement") will (a) in the case of the Registration Statement, at the time
it becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (b) in the case of
the Information Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Information
Statement and at the Closing Date, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior
to the Closing Date any event with respect to Seller, its officers and
directors or any of its subsidiaries shall occur that is required to be
described in the Information Statement or the Registration Statement, such
event shall be so described, and an appropriate amendment or supplement shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to
Seller\'s stockholders. The Registration Statement will comply (with respect
to Seller) as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act, and the Information Statement will comply (with respect to
Seller) as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act.   ARTICLE 5.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER  
Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Seller as follows:  5.1.
Organization and Good Standing.   Entravision License Sub is a limited
liability company, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of California. Entravision is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware.  5.2. Due Authorization.   Subject to the FCC Order,
Purchaser has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement, the
Deposit Escrow Agreement and the Time Brokerage Agreement and to carry out
Purchaser\'s obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the Deposit Escrow Agreement and the   -14-    Time
Brokerage Agreement by Purchaser and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary action, if any, on the part of Purchaser and Entravision License
Sub. This Agreement, the Deposit Escrow Agreement and the Time Brokerage
Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and each
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, enforceable
against it in accordance with its respective terms, except as may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
laws affecting creditors\' rights generally or general equitable
principles.  5.3. Execution and Delivery.   Neither the execution and
delivery by Purchaser of this Agreement, the Deposit Escrow Agreement or the
Time Brokerage Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby will: (a) conflict with or result in a breach
of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Purchaser or the
organizational documents of Entravision License Sub; (b) subject to the
FCC Order and compliance with the HSR Act, violate any Law or Order of any
court or Governmental Authority; or (c) violate or conflict with or
constitute a default under (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration under) any indenture, mortgage, lease, contract
or other instrument to which Purchaser or Entravision License Sub is a party
or by which Purchaser or Entravision License Sub is bound or
affected.  5.4. Consents.   No consent, approval, authorization, license,
exemption of, filing or registration with any court or Governmental Authority
is required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Deposit Escrow Agreement or the Time Brokerage Agreement by Purchaser or
the consummation by Purchaser or Entravision License Sub of any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby, other than the consent of the FCC and those
required under the HSR Act. No approval, authorization or consent of any
other Person is required in connection with the execution and delivery by
Purchaser of this Agreement, the Deposit Escrow Agreement and the Time
Brokerage Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, except as may have been previously obtained by
Purchaser.  5.5. Finders and Brokers.   Except for UBS Warburg (the fees
and expenses of which shall be borne solely by Purchaser), no person has as a
result of any agreement entered into by Purchaser any valid claim against any
of the parties hereto for a brokerage commission, finder\'s fee or other like
payment.   -15-    5.6. Qualification.   5.6.1. Entravision License
Sub is legally, financially and otherwise qualified to be the assignee of the
FCC Licenses, and no waivers shall be required by the FCC for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the grant of the FCC
Order. To Purchaser\'s knowledge, there are no facts or proceedings which
would reasonably be expected (a) to disqualify Entravision License Sub under
the Communications Act from holding the FCC Licenses, (b) to cause the FCC to
flag the FCC Application and/or initiate a review of the potential effects on
competition of the transaction, or (c) to cause the FCC not to consent to the
assignment of the FCC Licenses to Entravision License Sub.   5.6.2. To the
knowledge of Purchaser, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall not be
required to sell, dispose of or surrender any FCC license held by Purchaser
or any such Affiliate with respect to any broadcast properties, or any other
properties or businesses of Purchaser or such Affiliate, as may be required
under the Communications Act or the antitrust laws in order to consummate the
sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets contemplated by this Agreement or
the consummation and performance of the Time Brokerage Agreement. Except as
set forth on Schedule 5.6.2, neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser
owns or possesses, and has not entered into any agreement (other than this
Agreement) to acquire, any media interests (including the right to program
any broadcast stations) in any of the markets in which the Stations
operate.  5.7. Financial Ability.   Purchaser on the Closing Date will
have cash and Class A Common Stock available that is sufficient to enable
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  5.8. Issuance of the Shares.   The Shares, when issued, sold
and delivered to Seller at Closing, will be (a) duly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive or similar rights,
(b) free and clear of all Liens, (c) duly registered under the Securities Act
under a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (as the same may be amended, the
"Registration Statement"), (d) freely and immediately transferable and
distributable, in whole or in part, at any time by Seller, (e) free of all
restrictions on transfer under applicable federal and state securities Laws
or otherwise, and (f) issued in compliance with all applicable federal and
state securities Laws. The Shares will be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, subject only to official notice of issuance. No approval of the
stockholders of Purchaser is   -16-    required to issue the Shares to
Seller pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Purchaser makes no representation or warranty
whatsoever as to fluctuations in the market price of Purchaser\'s securities,
including the Shares.  5.9. Registration Statement and Information
Statement.   None of the information to be supplied by Purchaser for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement or the
Information Statement will (a) in the case of the Registration Statement, at
the time it becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (b) in
the case of the Information Statement, at the time of the mailing of the
Information Statement and at the Closing Date, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior
to the Closing Date any event with respect to Purchaser, its officers and
directors or any of its subsidiaries shall occur that is required to be
described in the Information Statement or the Registration Statement, such
event shall be so described, and an appropriate amendment or supplement shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to
Seller\'s stockholders. The Registration Statement will comply (with respect
to Purchaser) as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act, and the Information Statement will comply (with respect to
Purchaser) as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act.  5.10. SEC Reports.   Purchaser has heretofore filed with
the SEC all forms, statements, reports and documents (together with all
exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed by
Purchaser under each of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the SEC
rules and regulations thereunder, including an Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2001.   ARTICLE 6.  CERTAIN COVENANTS AND
AGREEMENTS  6.1. Regulatory Approvals.   6.1.1. As promptly as practicable
and no later than five (5) Business Days following the execution of this
Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall complete any filing that may be
required pursuant to the HSR Act (each an "HSR Filing"), or  
-17-    shall mutually agree that no such filing is required. Seller and
Purchaser shall diligently take, or fully cooperate in the taking of, all
necessary and proper steps, and provide any additional information reasonably
requested in order to comply with, the requirements of the HSR Act. Each
party shall pay its own expenses in connection with the HSR Filings and any
other similar filings required in any other jurisdiction, and shall share
equally any filing fees associated with the HSR Filings.   6.1.2. No later
than one (1) Business Day after the date hereof, Seller and Purchaser shall
jointly cause to be filed by Seller\'s FCC counsel one or more applications
with the FCC requesting its consent to the assignment of the FCC Licenses
from BCR License Sub to Entravision License Sub, which applications are
attached hereto at Exhibit A (the "FCC Application"). Each party shall
pay its own expenses in connection with the preparation and prosecution of
the FCC Application and shall share equally any filing fees associated with
the FCC Application.   6.1.3. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall each use their
respective reasonable best efforts to promptly (a) take, or to cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) obtain from any
Governmental Authority or other Person any actions, non-actions, clearances,
waivers, consents, approvals, permits or Orders required to be obtained by
Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with
the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and
the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub to Entravision
License Sub; (c) furnish all information required for any application or
other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law or any applicable
regulations of any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Registration Statement and
filings in connection with the HSR Act and the FCC Application, and to supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested in connection with such filings or applications; (d) avoid
the entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any Order that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing or the FCC Order, including defending against
and opposing any lawsuits or other proceedings (including any FCC
reconsideration or review), whether judicial or administrative, reviewing or
challenging this Agreement, the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or the assignment of the FCC Licenses from
BCR License Sub to Entravision License Sub; and (e) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to assign the FCC Licenses from BCR License
Sub to Entravision License Sub or to consummate any other transactions
contemplated by   -18-    this Agreement. No party to this Agreement
shall consent to any voluntary delay of the assignment of the FCC Licenses
from BCR License Sub to Entravision License Sub or the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated hereby at the behest of any Governmental
Authority or other Person without the consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without
limiting this Section 6.1.3, Purchaser agrees to take any and all reasonable
steps and to make any and all reasonable undertakings to (i) avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control,
competition, or trade regulation Law, including the Communications Act, that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) resolve
any objection that may be asserted by the FCC or any other Person in order to
obtain promptly the FCC Order or satisfy or comply with any conditions
imposed by the FCC Order, in all events so as to enable the Closing to occur
as soon as reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
agree that neither party shall be obligated, in complying with this Section
6.1.3, to take any actions to cause any third party to take any actions, in
regard to any Governmental Authority. It is understood and agreed that third
parties that may have interests in Seller or Purchaser, including the
interest of Univision Communications Inc. in Purchaser, are beyond the
control of Seller or Purchaser (except to the extent of any agreements
between Purchaser, Seller and any such third party, as applicable), and
cannot be required to take or cooperate in actions that would result in
obtaining necessary Governmental Authority action with respect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In no event
shall either party be responsible for adverse actions of a Governmental
Authority, with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, resulting from the actions or lack of cooperation of any
third parties.   6.1.4. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if the Closing occurs before the FCC Order becomes a Final Order,
the terms of Section 6.1.3 shall survive the Closing until the FCC Order
becomes a Final Order; provided, however, that such terms shall only survive
as applied to actions relating to the obtaining of the FCC Order and such FCC
Order becoming a Final Order. No assignment of the FCC Licenses shall occur
prior to obtaining the FCC Order.  6.2. Third Party Consents and
Notices.   6.2.1. Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
Third Party Consents and customary estoppel certificates as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement. All Third Party Consents shall
be in form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, and none shall provide for
any increase in cost or other change in terms and conditions after the
Closing which would be materially adverse to Purchaser.   -19-    
6.2.2. If any Third Party Consent has not been obtained prior to Closing and
prior to Closing an Alternative Arrangement has been obtained with respect to
the Assumed Contract to which such Third Party Consent pertains (in each
case, a "Deferred Contract"), then Seller shall retain, until such time
as such Third Party Consent shall have been obtained by Seller, all rights to
and liabilities under the Deferred Contract. Until the assignment of the
Deferred Contract, (a) Seller shall continue to use reasonable best efforts
and Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller to obtain all required consents or
approvals to remove any other impediments to such assignment, and (b) Seller
shall cooperate with Purchaser (and Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller) in
any lawful arrangement to provide (to the extent permitted without breach of
such Deferred Contract) that Purchaser shall receive the benefits of such
Deferred Contract after the Closing Date to the same extent, and without any
additional cost or expense to Purchaser, as if such Deferred Contract had
been assigned to Purchaser (such arrangement, an "Alternative Arrangement").
To the extent that Purchaser receives such benefits, Purchaser shall assume
Seller\'s Liabilities thereunder arising on or after the Closing Date with
respect to such Alternative Arrangement and Purchaser shall perform any such
obligations of Seller arising under such Alternative Arrangement. If,
subsequent to the Closing, Seller shall obtain all required consents or
approvals required to assign any Deferred Contract, the Deferred Contract for
which consent or approval to assign has been obtained shall at that time be
deemed to be conveyed, granted, bargained, sold, transferred, setover,
assigned, released, delivered and confirmed to Purchaser and assumed by
Purchaser, without need of further action by Seller or of
further documentation except for notice from Seller to Purchaser that such
consent or approval has been obtained; and from and after the effective date
such Deferred Contract is assigned to Purchaser, (i) no party shall have any
further liability under the Alternative Arrangement related thereto, and (ii)
the Deferred Contract shall be deemed to be an Assumed Contract.   6.2.3.
Prior to Closing, Seller shall provide written notice to third parties which
have entered into material contracts with any of the Stations (other than the
Assumed Contracts) regarding (a) the existence of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) that Purchaser is not assuming any
obligations of Seller or the Stations in respect of the contracts with
such third parties. Seller shall promptly provide copies of these written
notices to Purchaser.  6.3. Access to Information.   From the date hereof
until the Closing (upon reasonable notice to Seller), during normal business
hours, Seller shall, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees,
auditors and agents to, (a) afford the officers, employees and authorized
agents and representatives of Purchaser reasonable access to the offices,
properties, books and records of Seller to the extent related to the
Purchased Assets, and (b) furnish to the officers, employees and authorized
agents and representatives of   -20-    Purchaser such additional
information regarding the Purchased Assets as Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably request in order to assist Purchaser in fulfilling its obligations
under this Agreement and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including all engineering reports relating to the
upgrade of KLYY-FM described in Schedule 2.1.1 hereto (the "KLYY Upgrade");
provided, however, that such investigation shall not unreasonably interfere
with any of the businesses or operations of Seller or any Station.  6.4.
Confidentiality.   The terms of the confidentiality agreement dated as of
December 4, 2002 (the "Confidentiality Agreement") between Seller and
Purchaser are hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in
full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality
Agreement and the obligations of Purchaser under this Section 6.4 shall
terminate; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate only in respect of that portion of the Evaluation Material (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Purchased Assets. If this
Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and
effect.  6.5. Public Announcements.   Seller and Purchaser shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior written consent of the other party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party
may, without the prior written consent of the other party, issue such press
release or make such public statement as may, in the reasonable opinion of
counsel, be advisable or required by Law or any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange to which Seller or Purchaser is a party if it
has used all reasonable efforts to consult with the other party and to
obtain such party\'s consent but has been unable to do so in a timely
manner.  6.6. Ordinary Course of Business.   Subject to the terms of the
Time Brokerage Agreement and the obligations of the parties thereunder,
during the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, unless the prior
consent of Purchaser is first obtained, Seller shall cause the Stations to
not knowingly take any action which would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date.  
-21-    6.7. Control of the Station.   Prior to the Closing, Purchaser
shall not, directly or indirectly, control, supervise, direct, or attempt to
control, supervise, or direct, the operations of the Stations; such
operations, including complete control and supervision of all of the Stations
programs, employees, and policies, shall be the sole responsibility of Seller
until the Closing, except as contemplated by the Time Brokerage
Agreement.  6.8. Risk of Loss.   Seller shall bear the risk of all damage
to, loss of or destruction of any of the Purchased Assets between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date. If any material portion of the Purchased
Assets (other than items that are obsolete and not necessary for the
continued operations of the Stations) shall suffer any material damage or
destruction prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser
in writing of such damage or destruction, shall promptly take all necessary
steps to restore, repair or replace such assets at Seller\'s sole expense,
and shall advise Purchaser in writing of the estimated cost to complete such
restoration, repair or replacement and all amounts actually paid as of the
date of the estimate. If necessary and provided that Seller is diligently
pursuing such restoration, repair or replacement, the Closing Date shall be
extended for a period up to the Outside Date to accomplish such restoration,
repair or replacement. If such restoration, repair or replacement does not
exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and is not accomplished prior
to the Closing Date, as the same may be extended as provided herein, the
parties shall consummate the Closing and Purchaser shall receive
all insurance proceeds paid or payable to Seller and Purchaser shall
thereafter complete such restoration, repair or replacement at its sole
expense; provided, however, Seller shall have no further liabilities with
respect to such damage or destruction after payment to Purchaser of such
insurance proceeds. If such restoration, repair or replacement exceed One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and is not accomplished prior to the
Outside Date, Purchaser may terminate this Agreement in Purchaser\'s sole and
absolute discretion.  6.9. Collection of Receivables.   Within three (3)
Business Days after the effective date of the Time Brokerage Agreement (the
"TBA Date"), Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a complete and detailed list
of all the Stations\' accounts receivable arising from the broadcast of
advertising time on the Stations\' prior to the TBA Date ("Seller\'s AR").
For a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the TBA Date (the
"Collection Period"), Purchaser will promptly forward to the address for
Seller set forth in Section 11.6 below, any amounts received by Purchaser
at the Stations or otherwise representing any Seller\'s AR. Purchaser shall
not be required to institute any legal proceedings to enforce the collection
of Seller\'s AR or to refer   -22-    any of Seller\'s AR to a
collection agency. Any Account Receivable not collected by Purchaser within
the Collection Period shall revert to Seller. Purchaser shall reassign,
without recourse to Purchaser, each Account Receivable and deliver to Seller,
all records relating thereto on the same day as it remits to Seller the
collections received. Purchaser shall have no right to set-off any amounts
collected for Accounts Receivable for any amounts owed to Purchaser
by Seller. Purchaser shall incur no liability to Seller for any
uncollected account.  6.10. Time Brokerage Agreement.   Within one (1)
Business Day of the earlier of expiration or termination of any waiting
periods (and any extensions thereof) under the HSR Act, Seller and Purchaser
shall enter into a time brokerage agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Time Brokerage Agreement"). The
Time Brokerage Agreement shall remain in effect during the remainder of the
term of this Agreement and shall terminate upon termination of this Agreement
or consummation of the acquisition of the Purchased Assets by Purchaser
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or otherwise, Seller shall not be deemed to have breached or failed
to comply with any representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements with
respect to the Stations or the Purchased Assets if such breach or failure is
due or caused directly by any act, omission or instruction of Purchaser under
or in connection with the Time Brokerage Agreement or any activities or
transactions by Purchaser in furtherance thereof or in connection therewith
or any actions of Seller in accordance with the terms of the Time Brokerage
Agreement.  6.11. Filings; Other Actions.   6.11.1. Seller shall, as soon
as practicable after the date hereof, prepare and file with the SEC the
Information Statement and Purchaser shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Registration Statement (including the prospectus of Purchaser), in which the
Information Statement will be included. Purchaser and BCR shall share equally
any filing fees associated with the filing of the Registration Statement. The
Registration Statement shall include a plan of distribution providing for
both the distribution of the Shares from BCR to BCR\'s stockholders
("Stockholder Distribution"), and the sale of the Shares into the public
market by BCR and any Person deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning
of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act with respect to the
Shares (collectively, the "Selling Stockholders") (any such sale, a "Public
Sale"). Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to have
the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing. As promptly as practicable after
the Registration Statement shall have become effective, BCR shall mail
the Information Statement to BCR\'s stockholders. Purchaser shall also take
any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which
it   -23-    is currently not so qualified) required to be taken under
any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of the
Shares, and Seller shall furnish all information concerning Seller and BCR\'s
stockholders as may reasonably be requested in connection with any such
action.   6.11.2. If at any time after the Closing, BCR shall desire to
effect either a Stockholder Distribution or BCR or the Selling Stockholders
shall desire to effect a Public Sale, and BCR or the Selling Stockholders, as
the case may be, are not able to do so pursuant to the Registration Statement
because the information contained in the Registration Statement shall no
longer be current or for any other reason, then Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to reasonably promptly amend the Registration
Statement pursuant to which BCR may effect such Stockholder Distribution or
BCR and the Selling Stockholders may effect such Public Sale, as applicable.
With respect to the information to be included in any such amendment, Seller
shall be deemed to have made, as of the date of such amendment, the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.18 with respect to the
information supplied by Seller, and Purchaser shall be deemed to have made,
as of the date of such amendment, the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 5.9 with respect to the information supplied by Purchaser.
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement, as so amended, until such time as BCR shall have
completed such Stockholder Distribution or BCR and the Selling Stockholders
shall have completed such Public Sale, provided that Purchaser shall have no
obligation hereunder to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement beyond the date which is the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.11.2 to
the contrary, BCR acknowledges that, from time to time, there may be
circumstances under which Purchaser may notify BCR that BCR and the Selling
Stockholders may be required to suspend temporarily the use of
the Registration Statement, and any prospectus forming a part thereof, to
effect transactions as part of a Stockholder Distribution or Public Sale, and
BCR covenants and agrees (for itself and on behalf of the Selling
Stockholders) to cooperate fully with all such requests and notices from
Purchaser; provided, that Purchaser shall not have the right to require any
such suspension for more than a total of five (5) Business Days on any
occasion or on more than a total of two (2) occasions during the fifteen (15)
month period referred to above, for a maximum aggregate period of suspension
during such fifteen (15) month period of not in excess of ten (10) Business
Days.   6.11.3. Each party hereto agrees, subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, promptly to furnish the other
parties hereto with copies of written communications (and memoranda setting
forth the substance of all oral communications) received by such party, or
any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates (as such terms are defined
in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act as in   -24-    effect on the date
hereof), from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental

after the Closing Date, take or cause to be taken such further actions, and
execute, deliver and file or cause to be executed, delivered and filed such
further documents and instruments and obtain such consents, as may
be reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  11.4. Fees and
Expenses.   Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all
