hereby or thereby, other than those of the FCC and those required under the HSR
Act.

4.5.     Title to Personal Property.

         Except for leased property, Seller is the sole and exclusive legal

                                   ARTICLE 6.
                        CERTAIN COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

6.1.     Regulatory Approvals.

         6.1.1. As promptly as practicable and no later than five (5) Business
Days following the execution of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall
complete any filing that may be required pursuant to the HSR Act (each an "HSR
Filing"), or

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

shall mutually agree that no such filing is required. Seller and Purchaser shall
diligently take, or fully cooperate in the taking of, all necessary and proper
steps, and provide any additional information reasonably requested in order to
comply with, the requirements of the HSR Act. Each party shall pay its own
expenses in connection with the HSR Filings and any other similar filings
required in any other jurisdiction, and shall share equally any filing fees
associated with the HSR Filings.

         6.1.2. No later than one (1) Business Day after the date hereof, Seller
and Purchaser shall jointly cause to be filed by Seller's FCC counsel one or
more applications with the FCC requesting its consent to the assignment of the
FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub to Entravision License Sub, which applications
are attached hereto at Exhibit A (the "FCC Application"). Each party shall pay
its own expenses in connection with the preparation and prosecution of the FCC
Application and shall share equally any filing fees associated with the FCC
Application.

         6.1.3. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall each use their respective reasonable best
efforts to promptly (a) take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or to cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (b) obtain from any Governmental Authority or other Person any
actions, non-actions, clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or
Orders required to be obtained by Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, the consummation of the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR
License Sub to Entravision License Sub; (c) furnish all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law or any
applicable regulations of any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Registration
Statement and filings in connection with the HSR Act and the FCC Application,
and to supply promptly any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested in connection with such filings or applications; (d) avoid the
entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any Order that would restrain, prevent
or delay the Closing or the FCC Order, including defending against and opposing
any lawsuits or other proceedings (including any FCC reconsideration or review),
whether judicial or administrative, reviewing or challenging this Agreement, the
consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or the
assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub to Entravision License Sub;
and (e) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to assign the
FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub to Entravision License Sub or to consummate
any other transactions contemplated by

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

this Agreement. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary delay
of the assignment of the FCC Licenses from BCR License Sub to Entravision
License Sub or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby at
the behest of any Governmental Authority or other Person without the consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Without limiting this Section 6.1.3, Purchaser agrees to take any
and all reasonable steps and to make any and all reasonable undertakings to (i)
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger
control, competition, or trade regulation Law, including the Communications Act,
that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) resolve any
objection that may be asserted by the FCC or any other Person in order to obtain
promptly the FCC Order or satisfy or comply with any conditions imposed by the
FCC Order, in all events so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that
neither party shall be obligated, in complying with this Section 6.1.3, to take
any actions to cause any third party to take any actions, in regard to any
Governmental Authority. It is understood and agreed that third parties that may
have interests in Seller or Purchaser, including the interest of Univision
Communications Inc. in Purchaser, are beyond the control of Seller or Purchaser
(except to the extent of any agreements between Purchaser, Seller and any such
third party, as applicable), and cannot be required to take or cooperate in
actions that would result in obtaining necessary Governmental Authority action
with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In no event shall either party be responsible for adverse actions of
a Governmental Authority, with respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, resulting from the actions or lack of
cooperation of any third parties.

         6.1.4. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the Closing occurs before the FCC Order becomes a Final Order, the terms of
Section 6.1.3 shall survive the Closing until the FCC Order becomes a Final
Order; provided, however, that such terms shall only survive as applied to
actions relating to the obtaining of the FCC Order and such FCC Order becoming a
Final Order. No assignment of the FCC Licenses shall occur prior to obtaining
the FCC Order.

6.2.     Third Party Consents and Notices.

         6.2.1. Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all Third
Party Consents and customary estoppel certificates as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement. All Third Party Consents shall be in form
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, and none shall provide for any increase in
cost or other change in terms and conditions after the Closing which would be
materially adverse to Purchaser.

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

         6.2.2. If any Third Party Consent has not been obtained prior to
Closing and prior to Closing an Alternative Arrangement has been obtained with
respect to the Assumed Contract to which such Third Party Consent pertains (in
each case, a "Deferred Contract"), then Seller shall retain, until such time as
such Third Party Consent shall have been obtained by Seller, all rights to and
liabilities under the Deferred Contract. Until the assignment of the Deferred
Contract, (a) Seller shall continue to use reasonable best efforts and Purchaser
shall cooperate with Seller to obtain all required consents or approvals to
remove any other impediments to such assignment, and (b) Seller shall cooperate
with Purchaser (and Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller) in any lawful
arrangement to provide (to the extent permitted without breach of such Deferred
Contract) that Purchaser shall receive the benefits of such Deferred Contract
after the Closing Date to the same extent, and without any additional cost or
expense to Purchaser, as if such Deferred Contract had been assigned to
Purchaser (such arrangement, an "Alternative Arrangement"). To the extent that
Purchaser receives such benefits, Purchaser shall assume Seller's Liabilities
thereunder arising on or after the Closing Date with respect to such Alternative
Arrangement and Purchaser shall perform any such obligations of Seller arising
under such Alternative Arrangement. If, subsequent to the Closing, Seller shall
obtain all required consents or approvals required to assign any Deferred
Contract, the Deferred Contract for which consent or approval to assign has been
obtained shall at that time be deemed to be conveyed, granted, bargained, sold,
transferred, setover, assigned, released, delivered and confirmed to Purchaser
and assumed by Purchaser, without need of further action by Seller or of further
documentation except for notice from Seller to Purchaser that such consent or
approval has been obtained; and from and after the effective date such Deferred
Contract is assigned to Purchaser, (i) no party shall have any further liability
under the Alternative Arrangement related thereto, and (ii) the Deferred
Contract shall be deemed to be an Assumed Contract.

         6.2.3. Prior to Closing, Seller shall provide written notice to third
parties which have entered into material contracts with any of the Stations
(other than the Assumed Contracts) regarding (a) the existence of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) that Purchaser is not assuming
any obligations of Seller or the Stations in respect of the contracts with such
third parties. Seller shall promptly provide copies of these written notices to
Purchaser.

6.3.     Access to Information.

         From the date hereof until the Closing (upon reasonable notice to
Seller), during normal business hours, Seller shall, and shall cause its
officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents to, (a) afford the officers,
employees and authorized agents and representatives of Purchaser reasonable
access to the offices, properties, books and records of Seller to the extent
related to the Purchased Assets, and (b) furnish to the officers, employees and
authorized agents and representatives of

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

Purchaser such additional information regarding the Purchased Assets as
Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request in order to assist Purchaser
in fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and to facilitate the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including all engineering
reports relating to the upgrade of KLYY-FM described in Schedule 2.1.1 hereto
(the "KLYY Upgrade"); provided, however, that such investigation shall not
unreasonably interfere with any of the businesses or operations of Seller or any
Station.

6.4.   Confidentiality.

       The terms of the confidentiality agreement dated as of December 4, 2002
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") between Seller and Purchaser are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the
obligations of Purchaser under this Section 6.4 shall terminate; provided,
however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only in respect of
that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) exclusively relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Purchased Assets. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless
continue in full force and effect.

6.5.   Public Announcements.

       Seller and Purchaser shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior written
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided,
however, that a party may, without the prior written consent of the other party,
issue such press release or make such public statement as may, in the reasonable
opinion of counsel, be advisable or required by Law or any listing agreement
with a national securities exchange to which Seller or Purchaser is a party if
it has used all reasonable efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain
such party's consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner.

6.6.   Ordinary Course of Business.

       Subject to the terms of the Time Brokerage Agreement and the obligations
of the parties thereunder, during the period from the date hereof to the Closing
Date, unless the prior consent of Purchaser is first obtained, Seller shall
cause the Stations to not knowingly take any action which would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 not to be satisfied as of
the Closing Date.

                                      -21-

<PAGE>

6.7.   Control of the Station.

       Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall not, directly or indirectly,
control, supervise, direct, or attempt to control, supervise, or direct, the
operations of the Stations; such operations, including complete control and
supervision of all of the Stations programs, employees, and policies, shall be
the sole responsibility of Seller until the Closing, except as contemplated by
the Time Brokerage Agreement.

6.8.   Risk of Loss.

       Seller shall bear the risk of all damage to, loss of or destruction of
any of the Purchased Assets between the date of this Agreement and the Closing
Date. If any material portion of the Purchased Assets (other than items that are
obsolete and not necessary for the continued operations of the Stations) shall
suffer any material damage or destruction prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall promptly notify Purchaser in writing of such damage or destruction, shall
promptly take all necessary steps to restore, repair or replace such assets at
Seller's sole expense, and shall advise Purchaser in writing of the estimated
cost to complete such restoration, repair or replacement and all amounts
actually paid as of the date of the estimate. If necessary and provided that
Seller is diligently pursuing such restoration, repair or replacement, the
Closing Date shall be extended for a period up to the Outside Date to accomplish
such restoration, repair or replacement. If such restoration, repair or
replacement does not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and is not
accomplished prior to the Closing Date, as the same may be extended as provided
herein, the parties shall consummate the Closing and Purchaser shall receive all
insurance proceeds paid or payable to Seller and Purchaser shall thereafter
complete such restoration, repair or replacement at its sole expense; provided,
however, Seller shall have no further liabilities with respect to such damage or
destruction after payment to Purchaser of such insurance proceeds. If such
restoration, repair or replacement exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000) and is not accomplished prior to the Outside Date, Purchaser may
terminate this Agreement in Purchaser's sole and absolute discretion.

6.9.   Collection of Receivables.

       Within three (3) Business Days after the effective date of the Time
Brokerage Agreement (the "TBA Date"), Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a
complete and detailed list of all the Stations' accounts receivable arising from
the broadcast of advertising time on the Stations' prior to the TBA Date
("Seller's AR"). For a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the TBA
Date (the "Collection Period"), Purchaser will promptly forward to the address
for Seller set forth in Section 11.6 below, any amounts received by Purchaser at
the Stations or otherwise representing any Seller's AR. Purchaser shall not be
required to institute any legal proceedings to enforce the collection of
Seller's AR or to refer

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

any of Seller's AR to a collection agency. Any Account Receivable not collected
by Purchaser within the Collection Period shall revert to Seller. Purchaser
shall reassign, without recourse to Purchaser, each Account Receivable and
deliver to Seller, all records relating thereto on the same day as it remits to
Seller the collections received. Purchaser shall have no right to set-off any
amounts collected for Accounts Receivable for any amounts owed to Purchaser by
Seller. Purchaser shall incur no liability to Seller for any uncollected
account.

6.10.  Time Brokerage Agreement.

       Within one (1) Business Day of the earlier of expiration or termination
of any waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the HSR Act, Seller
and Purchaser shall enter into a time brokerage agreement in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Time Brokerage Agreement"). The Time
Brokerage Agreement shall remain in effect during the remainder of the term of
this Agreement and shall terminate upon termination of this Agreement or
consummation of the acquisition of the Purchased Assets by Purchaser hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
otherwise, Seller shall not be deemed to have breached or failed to comply with
any representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements with respect to the
Stations or the Purchased Assets if such breach or failure is due or caused
directly by any act, omission or instruction of Purchaser under or in connection
with the Time Brokerage Agreement or any activities or transactions by Purchaser
in furtherance thereof or in connection therewith or any actions of Seller in
accordance with the terms of the Time Brokerage Agreement.

6.11.  Filings; Other Actions.

       6.11.1. Seller shall, as soon as practicable after the date hereof,
prepare and file with the SEC the Information Statement and Purchaser shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement (including the
prospectus of Purchaser), in which the Information Statement will be included.
Purchaser and BCR shall share equally any filing fees associated with the filing
of the Registration Statement. The Registration Statement shall include a plan
of distribution providing for both the distribution of the Shares from BCR to
BCR's stockholders ("Stockholder Distribution"), and the sale of the Shares into
the public market by BCR and any Person deemed to be an "underwriter" within the
meaning of Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act with respect to the Shares
(collectively, the "Selling Stockholders") (any such sale, a "Public Sale").
Each of Purchaser and Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing. As promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement shall have become effective, BCR shall mail the
Information Statement to BCR's stockholders. Purchaser shall also take any
action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it

                                      -23-

<PAGE>

is currently not so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the issuance of the Shares, and Seller shall
furnish all information concerning Seller and BCR's stockholders as may
reasonably be requested in connection with any such action.

       6.11.2.  If at any time after the Closing, BCR shall desire to effect
either a Stockholder Distribution or BCR or the Selling Stockholders shall
desire to effect a Public Sale, and BCR or the Selling Stockholders, as the case
may be, are not able to do so pursuant to the Registration Statement because the
information contained in the Registration Statement shall no longer be current
or for any other reason, then Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to
reasonably promptly amend the Registration Statement pursuant to which BCR may
effect such Stockholder Distribution or BCR and the Selling Stockholders may
effect such Public Sale, as applicable. With respect to the information to be
included in any such amendment, Seller shall be deemed to have made, as of the
date of such amendment, the representations and warranties set forth in Section
4.18 with respect to the information supplied by Seller, and Purchaser shall be
deemed to have made, as of the date of such amendment, the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.9 with respect to the information supplied by
Purchaser. Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement, as so amended, until such time as
BCR shall have completed such Stockholder Distribution or BCR and the Selling
Stockholders shall have completed such Public Sale, provided that Purchaser
shall have no obligation hereunder to maintain the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement beyond the date which is the fifteen (15) month
anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 6.11.2 to the contrary, BCR acknowledges that, from time to time, there
may be circumstances under which Purchaser may notify BCR that BCR and the
Selling Stockholders may be required to suspend temporarily the use of the
Registration Statement, and any prospectus forming a part thereof, to effect
transactions as part of a Stockholder Distribution or Public Sale, and BCR
covenants and agrees (for itself and on behalf of the Selling Stockholders) to
cooperate fully with all such requests and notices from Purchaser; provided,
that Purchaser shall not have the right to require any such suspension for more
than a total of five (5) Business Days on any occasion or on more than a total
of two (2) occasions during the fifteen (15) month period referred to above, for
a maximum aggregate period of suspension during such fifteen (15) month period
of not in excess of ten (10) Business Days.

       6.11.3.  Each party hereto agrees, subject to applicable laws relating to
the exchange of information, promptly to furnish the other parties hereto with
copies of written communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance of
all oral communications) received by such party, or any of its subsidiaries,
affiliates or associates (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 under the
Exchange Act as in

                                      -24-

<PAGE>

effect on the date hereof), from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any
Governmental Authority in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.

       6.11.4. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Shares to be
approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice
of issuance.

6.12.  Employees.

       As of the Closing Date, Purchaser may, at Purchaser's option, offer
employment to any employee of Seller who works primarily at or for the Stations
on such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and
such employee. Notwithstanding any possible inferences to the contrary, neither
Seller nor Purchaser intends for this Section 6.12 to create any rights or
obligations except as between Seller and Purchaser, and no past, present or
future employees of Seller or Purchaser will be treated as third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.12.

6.13.  KLYY Upgrade.

       Prior to the Closing, Seller shall consult with Purchaser and obtain
Purchaser's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) prior to making any material changes to facilities in connection
with the KLYY Upgrade.

                                   ARTICLE 7.

Purchaser and Seller, or, if the terminating party is not then in material
breach of its obligations hereunder, upon written notice as follows:

      10.1.1. by Purchaser if Seller is in material breach of its obligations

would not be satisfied as of the Closing, and such breach has not been cured by

<PAGE>

is diligently attempting to cure such breach); provided, however, that no such

      In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1
above, all rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall
terminate without any liability of any party to any other party (except for any

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

11.1. Survival.

      The representations and warranties in this Agreement shall terminate at,
and will have no further force and effect after, the Closing. No covenants or
agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing,
except that covenants that contemplate or may involve actions to be taken or
obligations in effect after the Closing shall survive in accordance with their
terms.

11.2. Specific Performance.

      The parties acknowledge that the Purchased Assets and the transactions
contemplated hereby are unique, that a failure by Seller or Purchaser to
complete such transactions will cause irreparable injury to the other, and that
actual damages for any such failure may be difficult to ascertain and may be
inadequate. Consequently, Seller and Purchaser agree that each shall be
entitled, in the event of a default by the other, to specific performance of any
of the provisions of this Agreement in addition to any other legal or equitable
remedies to which the non-defaulting party may otherwise be entitled. In the
event any action is brought, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.

11.3. Additional Actions, Documents and Information.

      Purchaser agrees that it will, at any time, prior to, at or after the
Closing Date, take or cause to be taken such further actions, and execute,
deliver and file or cause to be executed, delivered and filed such further
documents and instruments and obtain such consents, as may be reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Seller agrees that it will, at any time, prior
to, at or after the Closing Date, take or cause to be taken such further
actions, and execute, deliver and file or cause to be executed, delivered and
filed such further documents and instruments and obtain such consents, as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

11.4. Fees and Expenses.

      Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all fees and
expenses, including fees and expenses of counsel, financial advisors, and
accountants incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fee or expense,
whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.

Taxes and fees arising from or associated with the transactions contemplated
hereunder, whether levied on Purchaser or Seller, shall be borne by Purchaser.
Purchaser or Seller, as required by Law, shall file all necessary documentation
with respect to, and make all payments of, such taxes and fees on a timely
basis; provided that Purchaser shall remit any funds necessary to pay such taxes
and fees under this Section 11.5 in sufficient time to allow timely payment of
any such taxes and fees.

11.6. Notices.

      All notices, demands, requests, or other communications which may be or
are required to be given or made by any party to any other party pursuant to
