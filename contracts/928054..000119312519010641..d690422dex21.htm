Companys good faith estimate of the following prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Principles (i) the balance sheet of the Company as of the

equal to the Estimated Purchase Price shall be payable at the Closing as

Section 1.3 Payment of the Purchase Price and Other Amounts _._ At

(a) On behalf of the Company, and at the direction of the Seller, the
Buyer shall deliver payment to the appropriate parties in respect of the
Indebtedness of the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing to be paid

bonuses or similar payments, accompanied by invoices in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer) at least five business days prior to the
Closing, by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds to
the accounts designated by the Seller at least five business days prior to the

Section 1.4 Purchase Price Adjustments _._ __

(a) The Parties agree that, so long as any distributions made are reflected
in Closing Working Capital and in any adjustments to the Purchase Price under
_Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)_, the Seller shall have the right, at or prior to the
Closing, to cause the Company to distribute cash to the Seller or
its Affiliates, by one or more dividends and/or other distributions.

(b) Within 90 calendar days following the Closing, the Buyer shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ "), in accordance with the Accounting Principles, which
shall include (i) a balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date, (ii)
a calculation of the total Working Capital of the Company as of the Closing
Date (the " _Closing Working Capital_ "), (iii) a calculation of the Working
Capital Deficit or the Working Capital Excess, as the case may be (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall include the Buyers calculation of the Target
Working Capital), (iv) a calculation of Closing Cash, (v) a calculation of
Closing Indebtedness, (vi) a calculation of Transaction Expenses and (vii)
the Buyers determination of the final Purchase Price (the " _Final Purchase
Price_ ") resulting therefrom. For purposes of the Buyers preparation of the
Closing Statement, the Seller shall make available or provide reasonable
access to the Buyer and its Representatives, upon advance notice and during
normal business hours, all information, books, records, data and working
papers created or used in connection with the preparation of the Estimated
Working Capital Certificate, to the extent not in the possession of the
Company or the Buyer. The Seller shall have a period of 30 calendar days after
delivery of the Closing Statement to review (and cause the Sellers auditors
to review) such documents and make any objections it may have in writing to
the Buyer. For purposes of the Sellers evaluation of the Closing Statement,
the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, make available or provide
reasonable access to the Seller and its Representatives, upon advance notice
and during normal business hours, all information, books, records, data and
working papers created or used in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Statement; and shall permit reasonable access, upon advance notice
and during normal business hours, to the facilities and personnel of the
Company as may be reasonably requested by the Seller and its Representatives
to analyze the Closing Statement. If the Seller delivers written objections
to the Buyer within such 30-day period, then the Buyer and the Seller shall
attempt to resolve the matter or matters in dispute. If no written objections
are made by the Seller within such 30-day period, then the Closing
Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties. If disputes with respect
to the Closing Statement cannot be resolved by the Buyer and the Seller within
30 calendar days after timely delivery of any objections thereto, then, at the
request of the Buyer or the Seller, the specific matters in dispute (but no
others) shall be submitted to such independent accounting firm as may be
approved by the Seller and the Buyer (the " _Auditors_ "), which firm shall
render its opinion as to such specific matters. If no such referral is made
within 45 calendar days after the delivery of the objections, then the Closing
Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties. If all objections are so
resolved between the Parties prior to such time, the Closing Statement with
such changes as have been agreed in writing by the Buyer and the Seller shall
be final and binding on the Parties. The matters to be resolved by the
Auditors shall be limited to the remaining unresolved disputes between the
Buyer and the Seller. The Parties shall cooperate with the Auditors during its
engagement, and the Auditors shall have access to the books and records of the
Company and the Buyer, the personnel of, and work papers prepared by,
the Parties accountants to the extent that they relate to the unresolved
disputes as it may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing such
unresolved disputes, provided, that such access shall be in a manner that does
not interfere with the normal business operations of the Buyer, the Company
or the Seller. The Auditors shall promptly deliver to the Buyer and the Seller
a written report setting forth their resolution of the disputes along with
their determination of the Final Purchase Price, which determination shall be

 



3

    

 made in accordance with the definitions and principles set forth in this
Agreement and shall be final and binding on the Parties. As to each disputed
item, the Auditors shall be limited to awarding only one or the other of the
Buyers proposal, on the one hand, or the Sellers proposal, on the other
hand, and shall have no authority to select or propose to the Parties any
resolution other than as set forth in one of such two proposals originally
submitted to the Auditors. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of
the Auditors in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which
such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the
Auditors shall be borne by the Parties as designated by the Auditors, which
designation shall be based upon the inverse proportion of the amount of
disputed items resolved in favor of such Party ( _i.e._ , so that the
prevailing Party bears a lesser amount of such fees and expenses). If the
Parties refer a dispute to the Auditors and if the Adjustment Escrow Funds
exceed the amount by which the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the
Final Purchase Price (as claimed by the Buyer), then the Buyer and the Seller
shall, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, promptly instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay the Seller the amount of such excess out of the Adjustment
Escrow Funds, and the remaining balance of the Adjustment Escrow Funds shall
be paid out pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)_ after the final determination
of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_.

 

(c) If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase
Price, then within two business days following the final determination
thereof, the Buyer and the Seller shall, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Buyer the amount of such
excess out of the Adjustment Escrow Funds (and if the balance of
the Adjustment Escrow Funds is less than the amount due to the Buyer pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 1.4_, then at the Buyers option the Buyer may recover
the remaining amount from the Indemnity Escrow Funds or require the Seller to
pay such amount to the Buyer by wire transfer in immediately available funds
to the account or accounts designated by the Buyer). If the Final Purchase
Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then within two business
days following the final determination thereof, the Buyer will pay to the
Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by the Seller the amount of such excess and the Buyer and
the Seller shall, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay the Seller the entire balance of the Adjustment Escrow
Funds. Any payments pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)_ shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by Law.

Section 1.5 Time and Place of the Closing. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of the
legal counsel to the Seller, on the second business day after the date on
which the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver
of all conditions to the obligations of the Parties set forth in _Article VI_
(other than such conditions as may, by their terms, only be satisfied at the
Closing or on the Closing Date, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions) shall occur, or at such other time or on such other date,
which may be the last day of the calendar month that includes such date, as
the Parties agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

__ _ 1.3_ and will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Seller, as

appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers

that limits the freedom of action of Buyer or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the ownership or operation of, or their ability to retain, any

Section 5.5 Prohibited Activities.

 

(a) In furtherance of the sale of the Shares to Buyer hereunder by virtue
of the transactions contemplated hereby and to protect more effectively the
value and goodwill of the Acquired Business being sold to Buyer, Seller will
not, directly or indirectly, for any reason, for its own account or on behalf
of or together with any other Person:

 

(i) engage as an owner, co-owner or other investor of or in,
or participate in, perform services for, or otherwise carry on, whether as an
employee, independent contractor or otherwise, the Company Business in the
United States of America (the "Territory") during the period beginning on the
date hereof and ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date;

(ii) call on, solicit or perform services for, either directly or
indirectly, any Person that at that time is, or at any time within two years
prior to that time was, a customer of the Acquired Business within any
Territory for the purpose of soliciting or selling any product or service
in competition with the Acquired Business in the Company Business within the
Territory during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the
fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; or

 

(iii) during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the
second anniversary of the Closing Date, hire, solicit, induce or attempt to
persuade or assist any person who is or was an employee of any Acquired Entity
during the twelve (12) month period before the Closing to leave the employment
of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Entity); _provided_
, _however_ , that the foregoing restriction shall not prohibit a general
solicitation through the media that is not targeted at employees of the
Acquired Business.

 

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_
shall prohibit Seller from owning less than two percent (2%) of the
outstanding securities of any entity whose equity securities are traded on any
national securities exchange.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, hold, in confidence any confidential information, whether
written or oral, concerning the Acquired Entities

 



31

    

 or the Acquired Business (including any Trade Secrets of the Acquired
Entities), and not use any such information for any purpose other than as
specified in this Agreement, except to the extent that Seller can show that
such information (i) is generally available to and known by the public through
no fault of Seller, any of its Affiliates or their employees, agents and other
representatives; or (ii) is lawfully acquired by Seller from and after the
Closing from sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such information
by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation. If Seller or any of its
agents and other representatives are compelled to disclose any
such information by judicial or administrative process or by other Laws,
Seller shall to the extent legally permissible promptly notify Buyer in
writing and shall disclose only that portion of such information which it is
advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, provided that Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or
other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information.

 

Section 5.6 Amendment of Seller Disclosure Letter. The Buyer agrees that,
with respect to representations and warranties of the Seller and the Company
contained in this Agreement, the Seller and the Company shall have the
continuing right (but not the obligation) until the Closing to add, supplement
or amend the Seller Disclosure Letter to their respective representations and
warranties with respect to any matter arising or discovered after the date
hereof which, if existing at the date hereof or thereafter, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Seller Disclosure Letter. Any
such additional, supplemental or amended disclosure shall not be deemed to
have cured any breach of any representation or warranty for any purpose
hereunder, including for purposes of the termination rights contained in
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_, of determining whether the conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ have been satisfied or of determining whether a breach
of a representation or warranty has occurred for purposes of indemnification
under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_; provided, however, that (a) if such additional,
supplemental or amended disclosures would give rise to a right of the Buyer to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_, assuming (i)
all other conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ had been satisfied, and
(ii) the Closing were scheduled to occur on the date that such additional,
supplemental or amended disclosures were received by the Buyer, then the
Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement within ten business
days of its receipt of such additional, supplemental or amended disclosure and
(b) if the Buyer does not so elect to terminate this Agreement, then the
Buyer shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this
Agreement with respect to such matters. For the avoidance of doubt, after the
Closing such supplements, additions and amendments shall not be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether a breach of a representation or
warranty has occurred for purposes of indemnification under _Section_ __ _
8.2_.

 

Section 5.7 Tax Matters.

 

(a) _Seller s Obligations._

 

(i) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Consolidated Returns that include the Company and shall pay
all Taxes due in respect of such Returns. All such Tax Returns, to the extent
they relate to the Predecessor Company, shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (unless otherwise required by Applicable Law).
From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to provide Seller
and its Affiliates in a timely fashion all filing information relating to the
Company necessary for the preparation and filing of the consolidated Tax
Returns.

 



32

    

(ii) The Seller shall prepare and timely file (taking into account all
valid extensions), or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed (taking into
account all valid extensions), any and all Tax Returns of an Acquired Entity
covering a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date, and each such Seller prepared
Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past custom and
practice except as otherwise required by applicable Law or fact. Subject to
the indemnification obligations of the Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.2(e)_, the Buyer shall be responsible for timely paying or causing the
applicable Acquired Entity to timely pay all Taxes reflected on a Seller
prepared Tax Return required to be paid by the applicable Acquired Entity to
the applicable Governmental Authority.

(b) _Buyer s Obligations._ Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause
to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities for
taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date that are not described
in  _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ and for any Straddle Period. Any Tax Return
related to a Straddle Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice (unless otherwise required by Applicable Law) and without a
change of any election or any accounting method and shall be submitted by
Buyer to Seller (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent
requested by Seller, supporting documentation) at least fifteen business days
prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If Seller
objects to any item on any such Tax Return, it shall, within five business
days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Buyer in writing that it so
objects, specifying with particularity any such item and stating the specific
factual or legal basis for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall
be duly delivered, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use
their reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. The preparation
and filing of any Tax Return of the Company that does not relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be exclusively within the control of Buyer. Seller
shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the portion of the Taxes with respect
to any such Tax Returns that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period (as
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ 5.7(d)), and to the extent such Taxes are
not included or reflected on the Closing Working Capital Statement, at the
later of five business days prior to the due date (including extensions) of
such Tax Returns or upon written demand therefor.

 

(c) _Amended Tax Returns_. The Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or
permit any of its Affiliates, any Acquired Entity, or any of their Affiliates
to, (i) amend, modify, or re-file any Tax Return of an Acquired Entity that
covers a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) grant an extension of any applicable
statute of limitations with respect to any Tax Return of an Acquired Entity
that covers a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) make or change any Tax election
that affects any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iv) take any action or position
that results in any increased Tax liability (including a reduction in a
refund) or reduction of any Tax attribute of an Acquired Entity with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, in each case without the prior written
consent of the Seller, except as required by an applicable Tax authority.

 

(d) _Determination of Straddle Period Taxes_. In the case of a Straddle
Period, the portion of Taxes attributable to such Straddle Period that are
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period shall be
determined as follows:

 

(i) the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, gains, or
receipts, or any Taxes other than Property Taxes, of the Acquired Entities
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period will be
determined based on an interim closing of the close of business on the Closing
Date;  _provided, however_ , that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to,

 



33

    

 depreciation and amortization deductions) will be allocated between the
period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each such period, and

(i) the amount of any real property, personal property, ad valorem, or
similar Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") of the Acquired Entities attributable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period will be deemed to be the
total amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date, and (B) the denominator
of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period.

(e) _Refunds_. The amount or economic benefit of any refund (whether in
cash or as a credit against or offset to any Tax) of any Tax of the Acquired
Entities attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period received by the Buyer, any
Acquired Entity, or any of their respective Affiliates, but only if and to
the extent such refund of Taxes exceeds the amount, if any, taken into
account in the final and binding Closing Working Capital, shall be for the
account of the Seller. Any such amount (including any interest received
thereon) shall be paid by the Buyer to the Seller for distribution to the
Seller within five business days after any such refund is received, credited
or applied as an offset, as the case may be.

 

(f) _Tax Cooperation_. Each party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates)
to provide the other parties with such assistance as may reasonably be
requested by the other such party in connection with the preparation of any
Tax Return of or with respect to an Acquired Entity or during the course of
any audit, investigation, or other examination by a Tax authority or any
judicial or administrative proceeding relating to Taxes of or attributable to
an Acquired Entity. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
request of another party) the provision of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Returns or audit, examination, or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Buyer agrees (i) to retain, and, following the Closing, to
cause the Acquired Entities to retain, all books and records with respect to
Tax matters relating to the Acquired Entities for any Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning on or before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Seller, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Tax period, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority, and (ii)
to give the Seller reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying, or discarding any such books and records and, if the Seller so
requests, the Buyer or such Acquired Entity, as the case may be, shall allow
the Seller to take possession of such books and records. Each party further
agrees, upon reasonable request by another party, to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Tax
authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce, or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the Seller, the Buyer or any
Acquired Entity (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

 

(g) _Tax Contests_.

 

(i) The Buyer agrees to give prompt written notice to the Seller if it or
any Buyer Indemnitee receives any communication or notice with respect to any
audit, review, examination, assessment, or any other administrative or
judicial proceeding with the purpose or effect of re-determining Taxes of or
with respect to an Acquired Entity (including any administrative or judicial
review of any claim for refund) for which the Seller may be required to
provide indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (a " _Tax Contest_ ").

 



34

    

(ii) The Seller shall have the right to control and defend the conduct of
any Tax Contest covering any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (or based on

 



36

hereof or as of the Closing Date) shall not be limited, diminished or
otherwise affected in any way as a result of the existence of such
Indemnified Partys or its Representatives knowledge of such breach or
untruth, the threat of such breach or untruth or the circumstances giving rise
to such breach or untruth as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date,
regardless of whether such knowledge exists as a result of the Indemnified

its respective Affiliates) if the failure of such Party or its

contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated on or before such date; or

 

(ii) any order issued, or Law enacted, entered or promulgated, by a
Governmental Authority permanently restrains, enjoins or prohibits or makes
illegal the consummation of the Acquisition in a manner that would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ or

nonappealable; _provided, however_ , that the Party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(ii)_ shall have used
complied in all material respects with its covenants and agreements contained
in _Section_ __ _ 5.4_;

forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ if continuing on the Closing Date;

 



40

    

(d) by the Buyer if the Seller or the Company shall have breached any of
their respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements

willful breach hereof or willful failure to perform its obligations hereunder

INTENDED TO APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR STRICT LIABILITY OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT
ON THE PART OF THE BUYER INDEMNITEES OR WHETHER DAMAGES ARE ASSERTED IN
CONTRACT, QUASI-CONTRACT, BREACH OF REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY (EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED), PERSONAL INJURY OR OTHER TORT, UNDER LAW OR OTHERWISE.

DAMAGES ARE ASSERTED IN CONTRACT, QUASI-CONTRACT, BREACH OF REPRESENTATION
AND WARRANTY (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED), PERSONAL INJURY OR OTHER TORT, UNDER LAW
OR OTHERWISE.

 

Section 8.4 Conditions of Indemnification.

 

(a) All Claims for indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or _Section_
__ _ 8.3_ shall be asserted and resolved as this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_
provides.

(b) In the event a Party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") (i) believes in good
faith that it has suffered or incurred Damages or (ii) learns of or receives
notice of any commencement of any Proceeding, the written assertion of any
Third-Party Claim or the imposition of any penalty, assessment or judgment,
in each case for which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2
_or _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, and such Party intends to seek indemnity from
another Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_
or _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, such Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying
Party (or, if the Indemnifying Party is a Seller, the Seller) with written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ "), which, in the case of a Claim Notice involving
a Proceeding, Third-Party Claim, penalty, assessment or judgment shall be
delivered reasonably promptly after the Indemnified Party receives written
notice of such Proceeding, Third-Party Claim, penalty, assessment or judgment;
_provided, however_ , that any Claim Notice must be received by the
Indemnifying Party (or, if the Indemnifying Party is a Seller, the Seller)
prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period. Each Claim Notice
shall describe, with as much detail as is reasonably practicable, the basis of
the Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to that Claim (if any) and
all other material written evidence thereof, an estimate of the amount of
damages attributable to that Claim to the extent feasible (which estimate will
not be conclusive of the final amount of that Claim) and the basis for the
Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement. The
failure to promptly deliver a Claim Notice will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations to the Indemnified Party with respect to the related
Third-Party Claim (i) unless the Indemnified Party fails to deliver a valid
Claim Notice prior to expiration of the applicable Survival Period or (ii)
unless and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby.

 



43

    

(c) Upon receipt of a Claim Notice from an Indemnified Party with respect
to a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect to assume and control
the defense of any such Third-Party Claim or any Proceeding resulting
therefrom. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Person
of its election to assume and control the defense of a Third-Party Claim or
any Proceeding resulting therefrom, the Indemnifying Party shall not, so long
as the Indemnifying Party diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_ for any fees of other counsel or
any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in
each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense of such Third-Party Claim, except as otherwise provided by this
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(c)_. In the event that an Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party will have the
right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend,
appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the
name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party will
furnish the Indemnifying Party with all information in its possession,
custody or control with respect to such Third-Party Claim and otherwise
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in all aspects of any
investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise, settlement or
discharge of such Third-Party Claim, including by providing the party with
all reasonably requested information and reasonable access to employees and
officers (including as witnesses) and the right to inspect and copy documents
and records or other information;  _provided, however_ , the Indemnifying
Party will not consent to any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to any Third-Party Claim that does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified
Party of a full and unconditional release from all liability in respect of
such claim or litigation. Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified
Party shall settle, compromise or make any other disposition of any Third-
Party Claim which would or might result in any liability to the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnifying Party, respectively, under this _Article VIII_
without the written consent of such other Party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Party agreeing to
such settlement, compromise or disposition. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party
Claim the Indemnifying Party controls under this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(c)_ and
will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to that participation;
_provided, however_ , that if the Indemnified Party has been advised in
writing by counsel that there is a conflict of interest which renders it
inadvisable for one firm to represent the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel at
the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party ( _provided_ , that such
counsel is limited to one separate firm of attorneys, in addition to one local
counsel firm), and, on its written notification of that employment, the
Indemnifying Party will not have the right to assume or continue the defense
of that action on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(c)_ shall not apply to Tax Contests, which shall be
governed by the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 5.7(g)_.

(d) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 8.4(c)_, if (i) the Indemnifying Party
elects not to defend the Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_ , (ii)
the Indemnifying Party fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party under _Section_ __
_ 8.4(c)_, (iii) the Indemnifying Party does not continue to diligently
pursue the defense of the Third-Party Claim following notice of election to
defend, (iv) a Buyer Indemnitee is the Indemnified Party and the anticipated
Buyer Indemnified Losses in respect of such Third-Party Claim would, or would
reasonably be expected to, exceed the then-remaining balance of the Indemnity
Escrow Funds (reduced by the aggregate amount of all Reserved Amounts), (v)
the Third-Party Claim seeks injunctive or other nonmonetary relief against the
Indemnified Party, (vi) the Third-Party Claim involves a material customer or
supplier of the Indemnified Party or (vii) the Third-Party Claim

 



44

    

 relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, indictment,
allegation, investigation or other Proceeding, then the Indemnified Party will
have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party (if the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder), the
Third-Party Claim by such actions as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute,
defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to such Third-Party Claim;
_provided, however_ , the Indemnified Party will not enter into any settlement
with respect to any Third-Party Claim that would result in payment of an
amount for which the Indemnifying Party would be liable under this  _Article
VIII_ without the prior consent of that Indemnifying Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). If the
Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against
any Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in all
reasonable respects with the conduct of such defense by the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement the Indemnified Party controls under this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(d)_,
and the Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect
to that participation. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(d)_ shall
not apply to Tax Contests, which shall be governed by the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(g)_.

 

Section 8.5 Payments by an Indemnifying Party. Payments of all amounts
owing by an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ relating to a Third-
Party Claim will be made within 30 days after the latest of (a) the settlement
of that Third-Party Claim, (b) the expiration of the period for appeal of a
final adjudication of that Third-Party Claim or (c) the expiration of the
period for appeal of a final adjudication of the Indemnifying Partys
liability to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement in respect of that
Third-Party Claim.

 

Section 8.6 Procedures for Direct Claims.

 

(a) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after its receipt of a Claim
Notice with respect to a claim for indemnification against the Buyer or the
Seller, respectively, hereunder that are not based upon Third-Party Claims
(such Claims, " _Direct Claims_ ") to respond in writing to such Direct Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such Direct Claim, in
which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may
be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement.

(b) Payments of all amounts owing by a Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.6(a)_ will be made within 30 days after the settlement, agreement or

liability with respect to such amount under this Agreement.

Section 8.7 Certain Limitations on Indemnification for Third-Party Claims
and Direct Claims.

(a) No indemnification shall be made by the Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_ (i) unless such individual Buyer
Indemnified Loss or series of related Buyer Indemnified Losses exceeds the
Threshold Amount, and (ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of Buyer
Indemnified Losses exceeding the Threshold Amount that would otherwise be
subject to indemnification exceeds the Deductible, and, in such event,
indemnification shall only be made by the Seller to the extent that the Buyer
Indemnified Losses exceed the Deductible. The maximum amount that the Seller
shall be required to pay pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ and _Section_ __
_ 8.2(c)_ in respect of all Buyer Indemnified Losses shall not exceed the
Damages Cap, after which point the Seller shall have no obligation to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and against further Buyer Indemnified

 



45

    

 Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_. The
Sellers obligation to indemnify the Buyer under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.2(e)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.13_
shall not be subject to any of the limitations in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.7_.

(b) No indemnification shall be made by the Buyer pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 8.3(a)_ (i) unless such Seller Indemnified Loss or series of Seller
Indemnified Losses exceeds the Threshold Amount, and (ii) unless and until the
aggregate amount of Seller Indemnified Losses exceeding the Threshold Amount
that would be subject to indemnification exceeds the Deductible, and, in such
event, indemnification shall only be made by the Buyer to the extent that the
Seller Indemnified Losses exceed the Deductible. The maximum amount that
the Buyer shall be required to pay pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ in
respect of all Seller Indemnified Losses shall not exceed the Damages Cap,
after which point the Buyer shall have no obligation to indemnify the
Seller Indemnitees from and against further Seller Indemnified Losses. The
Buyers obligations to pay the Seller the Purchase Price and the Buyers
obligations to indemnify the Seller under _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 9.13_ shall not be subject to any of the limitations in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.7_.

 

(c) The limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
8.7(b)_ shall not apply to Buyer Indemnified Losses or Seller Indemnified
Losses, respectively, based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason
of any inaccuracy in or breach of any Seller Fundamental Representation,
Company Fundamental Representation or Buyer Fundamental Representation.

(d) The amount of any Buyer Indemnified Losses shall be reduced by (i) any
amount actually received by a Buyer Indemnitee with respect thereto under any
insurance coverage (other than self-insurance or insurance coverage provided
by any captive insurance company that is an Affiliate of a Buyer Indemnitee)
or from any other party alleged to be responsible therefor and (ii) the amount
of any Tax Benefit actually realized by the Buyer Indemnitee relating thereto.
Any Indemnified Party having a claim under _Article VIII_ shall
use commercially reasonable efforts (provided that no Indemnified Party shall
be obligated to threaten or bring any Proceeding) to recover any Damages from
insurers of such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under applicable
insurance policies, in each case as to reduce the amount of any indemnifiable
Damages hereunder. If such a recovery or benefit is received or enjoyed by an
Indemnified Party after it receives payment or other credit under this
Agreement with respect to any Damages, then a refund equal in aggregate
amount of such recovery, reduction or setoff (net of reasonable expenses and
Tax or other costs incurred in obtaining such recovery or benefit) will be
made promptly to such Indemnifying Party. For purposes of this  _Section_ __
_ 8.7(d)_, a " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean a reduction in the Buyer
Indemnitees Taxes (calculated net of any Tax detriment resulting from the
receipt of any indemnification payment, including the present value of any
Tax detriment resulting from the loss of any depreciation and amortization
deductions over time, calculated using a discount rate of 3.5%) arising out of
any Damages that create a Tax deduction, credit or other Tax benefit.
In computing the amount of any such Tax Benefit, the Buyer Indemnitee shall
be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity
payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any Buyer Indemnified
Losses.

(e) The amount of any Seller Indemnified Losses shall be reduced by (i)
any amount actually received by a Seller Indemnitee with respect thereto under
any insurance coverage (other than self-insurance or insurance coverage
provided by any captive insurance company that is an Affiliate of a
Seller Indemnitee) or from any other party alleged to be responsible therefor
and (ii) the amount of any Tax Benefit actually realized by the Seller
Indemnitee relating thereto. Any Indemnified Party having a claim under
_Article VIII_ shall use commercially reasonable efforts

 



46

    

 (provided that no Indemnified Party shall be obligated to threaten or bring
any Proceeding) to recover any Damages from insurers of such Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates under applicable insurance policies, in each case as to
reduce the amount of any indemnifiable Damages hereunder. If such a recovery
or benefit is received or enjoyed by an Indemnified Party after it receives
payment or other credit under this Agreement with respect to any Damages,
then a refund equal in aggregate amount of such recovery, reduction or setoff
(net of reasonable expenses and Tax or other costs incurred in obtaining such
recovery or benefit) will be made promptly to such Indemnifying Party.
For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.7(e)_, a " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean
a reduction in the Seller Indemnitees Taxes (calculated net of any Tax
detriment resulting from the receipt of any indemnification
payment, including the present value of any Tax detriment resulting from the
loss of any depreciation and amortization deductions over time, calculated
using a discount rate of 3.5%) arising out of any Damages that create a Tax
deduction, credit or other Tax benefit. In computing the amount of any such
Tax Benefit, the Seller Indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize all other
items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item
arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence
or payment of any Seller Indemnified Losses.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to any indemnification under this _Article VIII_ if any Tax
attributes of the Company or any other Acquired Entity (including net
operating loss carryovers, capital loss carryovers, adjusted basis, or
credits) are not available to the Company or any other Acquired Entity or any
other Person for any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date.

 

Section 8.8 No Special Damages. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY
HEREIN, NO PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE UNDER THIS _A
RTICLE VIII_ FOR EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR SIMILAR DAMAGES, EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES TO AN UNAFFILIATED
THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A FINALLY ADJUDICATED THIRD-PARTY CLAIM, IN
WHICH CASE SUCH DAMAGES SHALL BE RECOVERABLE (TO THE EXTENT RECOVERABLE UNDER
THIS _A RTICLE VIII_ _)_ WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THIS _S ECTION_ __ __ _
8.8_.

 

Section 8.9 Escrow.

 

(a) In the event any Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for
Buyer Indemnified Losses under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.2(c)_, such Buyer Indemnitee shall seek payment first out of the Indemnity
Escrow Funds, and such Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek payment
directly from the Seller for such Buyer Indemnified Losses only if the
Indemnity Escrow Funds are reduced to zero, subject in all cases to the terms,
conditions and limitations of this _Article VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement.
Any Claim Notice delivered by a Buyer Indemnitee to the Seller in respect of
indemnification under this Agreement which may involve payment out of the
Indemnity Escrow Funds shall include, in addition to any other information
required by this _Article VIII_ , the Buyer Indemnitees good faith estimate
to the extent feasible (which estimate will not be conclusive of the final
amount of that Claim) of the amount of Indemnity Escrow Funds that should be
reserved in respect of such Buyer Indemnified Losses (the " _Reserved Amount_
").

(b) Upon final resolution of any Claim pursuant to this _Article VIII_
 where a Buyer Indemnitee seeks payment out of the Indemnity Escrow Funds,
the Seller and the Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent under the
Escrow Agreement to pay to the Buyer Indemnitee the lesser of (i) the amount
of the Buyer Indemnified Losses in respect of such Claim and (ii) the balance
of the Indemnity Escrow Funds.

 



47

    

(c) On the date that is six months following the Closing Date (the "
_First Escrow Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement

to, pay to the Seller an amount equal to $3,281,250 less the sum of (i)
the aggregate amount paid to the Buyer Indemnities in respect of Claims prior
to the First Release Date, if any, and (ii) the aggregate Reserved Amount as
of the First Escrow Release Date in respect of all unresolved Claims for
indemnification properly made by the Buyer Indemnitees prior to the First
Escrow Release Date, if any (provided that in the event the sum of (i) and
(ii) is equal to or greater than $3,281,250, no funds shall be paid to the
Seller on the First Escrow Release Date).

(d) On the date that is twelve months following the Closing Date (the "
_Second Escrow Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement
shall, and the Seller and the Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to, pay to the Seller an amount equal to $6,562,500 less the sum of (i) the
amount paid to the Seller on the First Escrow Release Date, (ii) the
aggregate amount paid to the Buyer Indemnities in respect of Claims prior to
the Second Release Date, if any, and (iii) the aggregate Reserved Amount as of
the Second Escrow Release Date in respect of all unresolved Claims for
indemnification properly made by the Buyer Indemnitees prior to the Second
Escrow Release Date, if any (provided that in the event the sum of (i), (ii)
and (iii) is equal to or greater than $6,562,500, no funds shall be paid to
the Seller on the Second Escrow Release Date).

(e) On the Cut-Off Date, the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement
shall, and the Seller and the Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to, pay to the Seller, the excess of the balance then on deposit pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement over the aggregate Reserved Amount in respect of all

prior to the Cut-Off Date, if any.

 

(f) Following the Cut-Off Date, from time to time, upon resolution of any
Claim for indemnification made by the Buyer Indemnitees and the appropriate
amount, if any, from the Indemnity Escrow Funds having been paid to the Buyer
Indemnitees in respect of such Claims, the Seller and the Buyer shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the Seller, the excess of the balance
then on deposit pursuant to the Escrow Agreement over the aggregate Reserved
Amount in respect of all remaining unresolved Claims for indemnification
properly made by the Buyer Indemnitees prior to the Cut-Off Date, if any.

Section 8.10 Sole and Exclusive Remedy.

(a) FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO INJUNCTIVE AND
PROVISIONAL RELIEF (INCLUDING SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING BUYERS ABILITY
TO SEEK RELIEF PURSUANT TO  _S ECTION_ __ __ _ 9.15_ WITH RESPECT TO

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event any Party
(or any other indemnitee) is entitled to a payment or other benefit under
more than one provision of this Agreement arising out of or resulting from the
same set of facts or circumstances and such Person has already been made whole
by payment or another benefit under one of those provisions, in no event
shall such Person be entitled to receive a subsequent payment or benefit under
any other provision of this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, any
liability for indemnification hereunder shall be without duplication ( _i.e._
, without allowing the claiming Party (or other indemnitee) to receive more
than its Damages) by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

 

(b) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under this
_Article VIII_ for Buyer Indemnified Losses to the extent such Buyer
Indemnified Losses were taken into account in the determination of the

_ 1.4_.

 

Section 8.13 No Setoff. Neither the Buyer nor any Seller shall have any

other Transaction Document. __

 

Section 8.14 Subrogation. Seller hereby irrevocably waives and releases any
right of contribution, subrogation or any similar right against the Acquired
Entities and any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of matters that are or may become

payments that Seller may, at any time, be required to make to any Buyer
indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement, whether directly or indirectly through
its interest in the Indemnity Escrow Funds.

 

Section 8.15 Manner of Construction. In determining (a) whether there is a
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Buyer, the
Seller or the Company pursuant to this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered in connection herewith and (b) the amount of Buyer Indemnified
Losses or Seller Indemnified Losses in connection therewith or arising
therefrom, such representation, warranty or certification shall be considered,
in each case, without giving effect to any materiality, Buyer Material Adverse
Effect, Seller Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications limiting the
scope of such representation, warranty or certification; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 8.15_ will not apply (i) where any such
representation, warranty or certification requires disclosure of lists of
items of a material nature or are qualified based on "Seller Material Adverse
Effect" in which case such qualifier shall not be deleted or (ii) in the case
of the representations and warranties in  _Section_ __ _ 3.8(b)_ and, for
the avoidance of doubt, the term "Material" shall not be deemed to be deleted
from the terms "Material Agreements," "Material Customers" or

reasonably be expected to give rise to, any Buyer Indemnified Losses or Seller

avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and
expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof.

54

    

Section 9.14 Time of the Essence. With regard to all dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

 

Section 9.15 Specific Performance.

 

(a) The Parties agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or
were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at
law would exist (even if damages would be available) and damages would be
difficult to determine, and that, unless this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with its terms, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement,
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
to compel performance by the Parties of their respective obligations set
forth in this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy at law or in
equity.

 

(b) Without limiting the general right to specific performance set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.15(a)_, each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that,
due to the nature of the Company, including the unique nature of the customer
relationships and other facts and circumstances, a non-breaching Party would
be damaged irreparably if a Party breaches its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required hereunder, _provided_
that all of the conditions to Closing set forth hereunder have been satisfied
or waived by the Party seeking to enforce this Agreement (other than the
covenants in _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, which the Party
seeking enforcement would be otherwise prepared to satisfy). Accordingly,
in the event of any such breach of a Partys obligation to consummate the
Closing, _provided_ that all of the conditions to Closing set forth hereunder
have been satisfied or waived by the Party seeking to enforce this Agreement
(other than the covenants in _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.6_,
which the Party seeking enforcement would be otherwise prepared to satisfy),
then the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Party seeking to enforce this
Agreement shall be entitled, at its election, to specifically enforce the
performance of the other Partys obligation to consummate the Closing as
required hereunder in any Proceeding, including a Proceeding for injunctive
relief.

 

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that (i) there
is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason in equity or at law, other than on the
basis that such remedy is not expressly available pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly available pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which
they may become entitled.

 



55

    

Section __ 9.16 Transaction Privilege.

 

(a) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Doherty and Doherty LLP ("
_DD_ ") has represented the Company, the Seller and one or more of their
Affiliates prior to the date of this Agreement, including in connection with
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that the Seller and such
Affiliates and their respective Representatives (each a " _Seller Entity_ "
and collectively, the " _Seller Entities_ ") have a reasonable expectation
that, after the Closing, DD will, if the Seller Entities so wish, represent
them in connection with any pending or possible or threatened Claim or any
other matter or Proceeding involving any Seller Entity or their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any other Party to this Agreement
(including the Company from and after the Closing) (an " _Other Party_ ") or
any of their respective Affiliates and Representatives (each an " _Other Party
Group Member_ " and collectively the " _Other Party Group Members_ "), on the
other hand, arising under or relating to this Agreement.

(b) Each Other Party, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Other Party
Group Members (which includes the Company and those other Persons that are or
after Closing will be Affiliates of such Other Party), hereby agrees to all of
the matters and consents to the potential future representations described in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.16_ and specifically expressly waives and agrees not to
assert any conflict of interest that may arise or be deemed to arise under
applicable Laws or standard of professional responsibility if, after the
Closing, DD represents any Seller Entities or other Persons in connection with
any Claim or Proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not such matter is one
in which DD may have previously advised the Seller Entities or in respect of
any other matters.

 

(c) Each Other Party, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Other Party
Group Members (which includes those Persons that are or after Closing will be
Affiliates of such Other Party), hereby consents to the disclosure by DD to
the Seller or any of their Affiliates, directors, members, partners, officers
or employees of any information learned by DD in the course of its
representation of the Seller or their Affiliates, whether or not such
information is subject to attorney client privilege or DDs duty of
confidentiality.

 

(d) In addition, each of the Parties irrevocably acknowledges and agrees
that, from and after the Closing, the attorney-client privilege arising from
communications prior to the Closing between any one or more of the Seller
Entities and the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes for
purposes hereof any Representatives of the Seller Entities and the Company),
on the one hand, and DD, on the other hand, to the extent related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be
excluded from the assets or any other property, rights, privileges, powers,
franchises and other interests held by any Other Party Group Members, that
such attorney-client privilege shall be deemed held solely by the Seller
Entities, and that no Other Party Group Member shall have any right to assert,
waive or otherwise alter any such attorney-client privilege at any time after
the Closing. All communications between the Seller Entities or the Company, on
the one hand, and DD, on the other hand, relating to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement shall be deemed to be privileged and to belong
solely to the Seller Entities (and not Other Party Group Members). The Other
Party Group Members shall not have access to any such communications,
files, records or other documents (as used herein whether in electronic form
or otherwise), of DD relating to such engagement. The Other Parties, to the
fullest extent allowed by Law, agree (i) that no waiver of any privilege or
right of the Seller Entities is intended or will be

 



56

    

 claimed by any Other Party as a result of any communications, files, records
or other documents being maintained within the records or files, of any Other
Party Group Member or otherwise in its possession or control, (ii) all Other
Party Group Members shall endeavor to delete or destroy all such documents and
information in their possession or control that come to their attention and
(iii) no Other Party Group Member will review, offer into evidence or
otherwise attempt to use any such communications, files, records or documents
(whether or not so maintained) in any claim or Proceeding involving any Seller
Entity or their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Other Party Group
Member, on the other hand, arising under or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) The Buyer and its respective Affiliates (including the Company after
the Closing) further covenant and agree that, from and after the Closing,
each shall not assert any claim against DD in respect of legal services
provided to the Company, the Seller or its Affiliates by DD in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f) This _Section_ __ _ 9.16_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.16_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior
written consent of DD, the Seller and its respective Affiliates affected
thereby.
