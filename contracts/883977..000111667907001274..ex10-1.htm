OF

  

 **HELLMAN and FRIEDMAN CAPITAL PARTNERS VI, L.P. **

  

LIMITED GUARANTEE, dated as of April 17, 2007 (this " _Limited Guarantee_ "),
by Hellman and Friedman Capital Partners VI, L.P. (" _Guarantor_ ") in favor of
Catalina Marketing Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").
Any capitalized term not otherwise defined herein shall be as defined in the
Merger Agreement (as defined below).

  

 **1.** **LIMITED GUARANTEE**. To induce the Company to enter
into that certain Agreement of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), by and among the Company, Checkout Holding Corp., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Checkout Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," and
together with Parent, the " _Parent Parties_ "), the Guarantor absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Company, on the terms
and conditions set forth herein, the due, punctual and complete payment and
performance, if and when due, of (i) 100% of Parent\'s payment obligation with
respect to the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to and only in accordance with
Section 7.3(d) of the Merger Agreement and any additional amounts that may
become due pursuant to Section 7.3(e) of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) any
other obligations of Parent under the Merger Agreement as a result of a breach
thereof by Parent or Merger Sub (the payment obligations referred to above
(collectively, the " _Obligations_ "); provided that the maximum aggregate
amount payable by the Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee (exclusive of the
reimbursement of costs and expenses, if applicable, pursuant to and only in
accordance with Section 16 hereof (such payment, if and only if required to be
paid by Guarantor in accordance with the terms hereof, the " _Prevailing
Party Costs_ ")) shall not exceed the aggregate of $50,640,000 U.S. Dollars
(the " _Cap_ "), it being understood that this Limited Guarantee may not be
enforced without giving effect to the Cap. Except for Prevailing Party Costs,
the Company hereby agrees that in no event shall the Guarantor be required to
pay to any Person under, in respect of, or in connection with this Limited
Guarantee, more than the Cap, and that Guarantor shall not have any obligation
or liability to any Person relating to, arising out of or in connection with,
this Limited Guarantee or the Merger Agreement other than as expressly set
forth herein. All sums payable by the Guarantor hereunder shall be made in
immediately available funds. The Company may, in its sole discretion, bring
and prosecute a separate action or actions against the Guarantor for the full
payment of the Obligations, subject to the Cap (plus any Prevailing Party
Costs), regardless of whether the action is brought against one or both of
the Parent Parties or whether one or both of the Parent Parties is joined in
any such action or actions.

   

 **2.** **NATURE OF LIMITED GUARANTEE.**

  

(a) The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to
the Obligations in the event that one or both of the Parent Parties becomes
subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure
of the Company to so file shall not affect the Guarantors obligations
hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Company in respect of the
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason
whatsoever, the Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the
Obligations (plus any Prevailing Party Costs) as if such payment had not been
made (subject to the terms hereof). This is an

unconditional guarantee of payment and not of collectibility. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Limited Guarantee, the Company hereby agrees that
(i) the Guarantor may assert, as a defense to any payment or performance by
the Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee, any defense to such payment or
performance that Parent or Merger Sub could assert against the Company under
the terms of the Merger Agreement, other than any such defense exclusively
arising out of, due to, or as a result of, the insolvency or bankruptcy of
Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) to the extent Parent and Merger Sub are relieved
by the parties to the Merger Agreement (including the Company) of their
obligations under Section 7.3(d) of the Merger Agreement, the Guarantor shall
be similarly relieved of its Obligations under this Limited Guarantee.

  

(b) The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date
hereof, each of Parents and Merger Subs sole assets are a _de minimis_
amount of cash and their respective rights under the Merger Agreement, and
that no additional funds or assets are expected to be contributed to Parent or
Merger Sub unless and until the Closing occurs.

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this
Limited Guarantee or any document or instrument delivered contemporaneously
herewith, and notwithstanding the fact that the Guarantor may be a limited
partnership, by its acceptance of the benefits of this Limited Guarantee, the
Company covenants and agrees that (1) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and the Company agrees to the maximum extent
permitted by Legal Requirement, none of its officers, directors, security
holders or representatives, has or shall have any right of recovery under or
in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby or otherwise relating thereto, and to the extent that it has or
obtains any such right, it, to the maximum extent permitted by Legal
Requirement, hereby waives (on its own behalf and on behalf of each of the
aforementioned persons) each and every such right against, and hereby
releases, and no personal liability shall attach to, the Guarantor or any of
the Sponsor Affiliates (as defined below), from and with respect to any claim,
known or unknown, now existing or hereafter arising, in connection with any
transaction contemplated by or otherwise relating to the Merger Agreement or
the transactions contemplated thereby, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub (or any other Person) against any Sponsor
Affiliate (including, without limitation, a claim to enforce the Equity
Commitment Letter, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Legal
Requirement, or otherwise) (the " _Released Claims_ "), except for its rights
to recover from the Guarantor (but not any Sponsor Affiliate (including,
without limitation, any general partner or managing member)) under and to the
extent provided in this Limited Guarantee (subject to the limitations
described herein); and (2) recourse against the Guarantor under this Limited
Guarantee (subject to the limitations described herein) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company and all of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates
against the Guarantor and each Sponsor Affiliate in respect of any liabilities
or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or
the transactions contemplated thereby or otherwise relating thereto. For
purposes of this Limited Guarantee, "Sponsor Affiliate" means, collectively,
any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or
limited partner, manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate (other than Parent or
Merger Sub) or assignee of the undersigned or any Sponsor Affiliate or any
former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or
limited partner, manager,

member, stockholder, Affiliate (other than Parent or Merger Sub) or assignee
of any of the foregoing.

  

(d) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not
institute, directly or indirectly, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates not to institute, in the name of or on behalf of the Company or any
other Person, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in
connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby
or otherwise relating thereto, against the Guarantor or the Sponsor Affiliates
except for claims against the Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee (subject
to the limitations described herein).

  

(e) The Company acknowledges that the Guarantor is agreeing to enter
into this Limited Guarantee in reliance on the provisions set forth in
Sections 2(b) through (e). Section 2(b), 2(c), 2(d) and 2(e) shall survive
termination of this Limited Guarantee.

  

 **3.** **CHANGES IN OBLIGATIONS; CERTAIN WAIVERS**. The
Guarantor agrees that the Company may at any time and from time to time,
without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of
payment of any of the Obligations, and also may make any agreement with one or
both of the Parent Parties for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise,
discharge or release thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of
the terms thereof or of any agreement between the Company, on the one hand,
and one or both of the Parent Parties, on the other hand, without in any way
impairing or affecting the Guarantors obligations under this Limited
Guarantee. The Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or
otherwise affected by: (a) the failure of the Company to assert any claim or
demand or to enforce any right or remedy against one or both of the Parent
Parties or any Other Guarantor; (b) any change in the time, place or manner of
payment of any of the Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise,
consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or
provisions of the Merger Agreement or any other agreement evidencing, securing
or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Obligations (provided that
any such change, rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other
amendment or modification shall be subject to the prior written consent of the
Parent Parties to the extent expressly required by the Merger Agreement); (c)
the addition, substitution or release of any Person interested in the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (provided, that any such
addition, substitution or release shall be subject to the prior written
consent of the Parent Parties to the extent expressly required under the
Merger Agreement); (d) any change in the corporate or limited liability
company existence, structure or ownership of one or both of the Parent Parties
or any other Person liable with respect to any of the Obligations; (e) any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting
one or both of the Parent Parties, or any other Person liable with respect to
any of the Obligations; (f) subject to the last sentence of Section 2(a)
hereof, any lack of validity or enforceability of the Merger Agreement or any
agreement or instrument relating thereto; (g) the existence of any claim, set-
off or other rights which the Guarantor may have at any time against one or
both of the Parent Parties or the Company, whether in connection with the
Obligations or otherwise; or (h) the adequacy of any other means the Company
may have of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations. To the fullest extent
permitted by Legal Requirement, the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and
all rights or defenses arising by reason of any Legal Requirement which would
otherwise require any election of remedies by the

  



  

 _[LIMITED GUARANTEE]_

Company. The Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance
of this Limited Guarantee and of the Obligations, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of
any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind (except for notices
to be provided to the Parent Parties and Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP in
accordance with Section 8.9 of the Merger Agreement), all defenses which may
be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium or other similar
Legal Requirement now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the
marshalling of assets of one or both of the Parent Parties, or any other
Person liable with respect to any of the Obligations, and all suretyship
defenses generally (other than breach by the Company of this Limited
Guarantee). The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that
it shall not institute, and shall cause its Affiliates not to institute, any
proceeding asserting that this Limited Guarantee is illegal, invalid or
unenforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general application relating to or affecting creditors
rights, and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law). The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Limited Guarantee
are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits and after the advice of
counsel.

  

 **4.** **NO SUBROGATION**. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waives and agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now
have or hereafter acquire against one or both of the Parent Parties or any
other Person liable with respect to any of the Obligations that arise from the
existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of the Guarantors obligations
under or in respect of this Limited Guarantee or any other agreement in
connection therewith, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Company against one or both of the
Parent Parties or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement liable with respect to any of the Obligations,
whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract
or any applicable Legal Requirement, including, without limitation, the right
to take or receive from one or both of the Parent Parties or any other Person
liable with respect to any of the Obligations, directly or indirectly, in cash
or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on
account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the
Obligations and Prevailing Party Costs, if applicable, shall have been
irrevocably paid in full in cash; provided that, the Guarantor shall have the
right to cause any other Person to satisfy its payment obligations to the
Company under Section 1 hereof; provided, however, that such right in the
preceding proviso shall only relieve the Guarantor of its obligation to make
such payment when such payment is irrevocably paid by such other Person in
full in cash. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of
the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in
cash of the Obligations and Prevailing Party Costs, if applicable, such amount
shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Company, shall be
segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith
be paid or delivered to the Company in the same form as so received (with any
necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the
Obligations and Prevailing Party Costs, if applicable,, whether matured or
unmatured, or to be held as collateral for any Obligations or Prevailing Party
Costs, if applicable, thereafter arising.

 **5.** **NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE RIGHTS**. No failure on the part
of the Company to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or
power hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise by the Company of any right, remedy or power hereunder
preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder.
Each and every right, remedy or power hereby granted to the Company or allowed
pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Company at any time or
from time to time. The Company shall not have any obligation to proceed at any
time or in any manner against, or exhaust any or all of the Companys rights
against, the Parent Parties or any other Person liable for the Obligations
prior to proceeding against Guarantor.

 **7.** **CONTINUING GUARANTEE; TERMINATION**. This Limited

Costs, or that any other provisions of this Limited Guarantee are illegal,

Limited Guarantee hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Limited Guarantee shall be
brought in federal or state courts of the State of New York and each party
hereto agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in
any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the action, suit or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action,

recover from the non-prevailing party its reasonable and documented attorneys
fees and all other reasonable court costs and expenses incurred in such action
or suit (" _Prevailing Party Costs_ "). The parties agree that the
determination of who is the prevailing party and the amount of such Costs
shall be made by the court in any such action. Any payment by the Guarantor
under this Section 16 shall not reduce, limit, or otherwise affect the other

GUARANTEE OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
