AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION 

   

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of August 12, 2007, by and among: RF Micro Devices, Inc., a North Carolina corporation ("Parent"); Iceman Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and Sirenza Microdevices, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

 B. It is intended that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the First Merger and the Second Merger (collectively, the "Mergers") (i) together shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) shall each constitute integrated steps in a single plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §§ 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3T(a). 

  

 C. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and the Mergers. 

  

 D. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause the Mergers to be consummated, certain stockholders of the Company are executing voting agreements in favor of Parent concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Stockholder Voting Agreements"). 

  

 E. In order to induce the Company to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Mergers, certain shareholders of Parent are executing voting agreements in favor of the Company concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Parent Shareholder Voting Agreements").

 1.5 Conversion of Shares. 

   

 (a) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company: 

  

 (i) any shares of Company Common Stock held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the First Effective Time (or held in the Companys treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; 

  

 (ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor; 

  

 (iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to Sections 1.5(b), 1.5(c), 1.5(d) and 1.9, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive a combination of: (A) cash in the amount of $5.56 (the "Per Share Cash Amount"): and (B) 1.7848 shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio"); and each share of the Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation; and 

  

 (iv) each share of the Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

The Per Share Cash Amount and the Exchange Ratio (as each of them may be
adjusted in accordance with Section 1.5(b)) are collectively referred to as
the "Merger Consideration". 

   

 (b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the First Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a 

   ##### 

  

 

different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or
if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during such period, or a
record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such
period, then the Per Share Cash Amount and the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. If, during the period
from the date of this Agreement through the First Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number
or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if
a stock dividend is declared by Parent during such period, or a record date
with respect to any such event shall occur during such period, then the
Exchange Ratio (but not the Per Share Cash Amount) shall be adjusted to the
extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such action. 

   

 (c) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable Company RSA or other Contract with the Company or under which the Company has any rights, then: (i) the cash and shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition; and (ii) the certificates representing any such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the First Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such Company RSA or other Contract. 

  

 (d) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the First Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.6), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date the First Merger becomes effective. The amount of cash, if any, that each stockholder of the Company is entitled to receive for the shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder shall be rounded to the nearest cent (with $0.005 being rounded upward) and computed after aggregating the cash amounts payable for all shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder. 

  

 1.6 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the First Effective Time: (a) all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of

Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective
Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be
made on such stock transfer books after the First Effective Time. If, after
the First Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the
Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 1.7) or to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be
exchanged as provided in Section 1.7. 

   

 1.7 Exchange of Certificates. 

   

 (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as payment and exchange agent in the First Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). As promptly as practicable after the First Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent: (i) subject to Section 1.5(c), cash sufficient to make the aggregate payments pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii)(A); (ii) subject to Section 1.5(c), certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(iii)(B); and (iii) cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(d). The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, are referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund." To the extent that the cash in the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Exchange Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this Agreement (including with respect to former shares held by Company stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL), Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make such payments contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the First Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail to the Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates immediately prior to the First Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for cash and certificates representing Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (1) subject to Section 1.5(c), the cash amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5(a)(iii)(A); and (2) subject to Section 1.5(c), a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5(a)(iii)(B) (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(d)); and (B) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.7(b), each Company Stock 

   ##### 

  

 

Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the First Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5(a)(iii) and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5(d). If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition to the payment of any cash or the
issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide
an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in accordance with
the customary practices of the transfer agent for Parent Common Stock or the
Exchange Agent) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate. 

   

 (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the First Effective Time shall be paid or otherwise delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the First Merger until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions, without interest). 

  

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock Certificates as of the date 180 days after the date on which the First Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for cash and shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5(a)(iii), cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code or any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

  

 (f) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or other similar Legal Requirement. 

  

 1.8 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the Mergers are intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3T(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations of which the 

    ##### 

  

 

First Merger and the Second Merger are intended to constitute integrated
steps. None of the parties shall take any action that would reasonably be
expected to cause the Mergers to fail to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

 1.9 Appraisal Rights. 

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any shares of Company Common Stock that, as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time, are held by holders who have as of such time preserved appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(iii), or cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(d), and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;  _provided, however,_ that if such appraisal rights shall not be perfected or the holders of such shares shall otherwise lose their appraisal rights with respect to such shares, then, as of the later of the First Effective Time or the time of the failure to perfect such status or the loss of such rights, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s) in accordance with Section 1.7) cash and shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(iii) and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(d). 

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demand received by the Company prior to the First Effective Time to require the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the First Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the First Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer. 

  

 1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the First Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a material liability, the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect to all current and former participants in such Foreign Plan according to the reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Plan, and no Contemplated Transaction will cause any such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. There are no material liabilities of the Acquired Corporations with respect to any Company Employee Plan that are not properly accrued and reflected in the financial statements of the Company in accordance with GAAP. 

  

 (i) None of the Acquired Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any: (i) Company Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA; (ii) "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of ERISA; or (iii) plan described in Section 413 of the Code.

participated in or contributed to any Company Pension Plan or Foreign Plan in
which stock of any of the Acquired Corporations or any Company Affiliate is
or was held as a plan asset. No Contemplated Transaction will cause any such
assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.
Each unfunded Foreign Plan is secured by an insurance contract
guaranteeing payment of the full amount of the payments and benefits due or
that may become due under such Foreign Plan to all current and former
participants. There are no material liabilities of the Acquired Corporations
with respect to any Company Employee Plan and any Foreign Plan that are
not properly accrued and reflected in the financial statements of the Company

No Company Employee Plan and no Foreign Plan provides (except at no cost to the Acquired Corporations or any Company Affiliate), or reflects or represents any liability of any of the Acquired Corporations or any Company Affiliate to provide post-termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal Requirements. Other than commitments made that involve no future costs to any of the Acquired Corporations or any Company Affiliate, none of the Acquired Corporations nor any Company Affiliate has ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Company Associate (either individually or to Company Associates as a group) or any other Person that such Company Associate(s) or other Person would be provided with retiree life insurance, or retiree health benefit or retiree employee welfare benefits, except to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 (k) To the knowledge of the Company, and except as expressly required or provided by this Agreement, neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions is reasonably expected to (either alone or upon the occurrence of termination of employment) constitute an event under any Company Employee Plan, Foreign Plan, or Company Employee Agreement (or any trust or loan related to such plans or agreements) that will or may result (either alone or in connection with any other circumstance or event) in any material payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company Associate. 

  

 (l) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any Company Associate, and no payments have been made or will be made to any Company Associate, that, considered individually or considered collectively with any other such Contracts or payments, will, or could reasonably be expected to, be characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code or give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code (or any comparable provision under state or foreign Tax laws). No Acquired Corporation is a party to or has any obligation under any Contract to compensate any Person for excise taxes payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code or for additional taxes payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

All obligations and liabilities of the Acquired Corporations to provide pensions and pension benefits to all German Employees (whether pursuant to German Legal Requirements, the terms of a Foreign Plan, any practice or otherwise) are accrued on the Company Unaudited Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of this Agreement (other than the first full sentence of this Section 2.15(p)), the term "German Employee" shall be construed to include consultants, freelancers who devote a majority of their working time to the business of an Acquired Corporation or, due to the circumstances of their engagement, could otherwise be reasonably deemed to be subject to German Legal Requirements with respect to labor matters.

 (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding any of the Acquired Corporations to any Person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; 

  

 (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; or 

  

 (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction; 

 

 _provided, however,_ that prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, this
Section 4.3(a) shall not prohibit the Company from furnishing nonpublic
information regarding the Acquired Corporations to, or entering into
discussions and negotiations with, any Person in response to an
Acquisition Proposal made by such Person (and not withdrawn) that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Offer if:
(A) neither the Company nor any Representative of any of the Acquired
Corporations shall have breached in any material respect any of the provisions
set forth in this Section 4.3 in connection with such Acquisition Proposal;
(B) the board of directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Companys board of directors under applicable law;
(C) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the Company gives Parent
written notice of the identity of such Person and of the Companys
intention to furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, and the Company receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions (including with
respect to the non-solicitation of employees) at least as favorable to the
Company as the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement; and (D) prior to
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company
furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such
nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by the Company to
Parent). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
acknowledges and agrees that any breach of any of the provisions set forth in
the preceding sentence by any director, officer, controlled affiliate, agent
or attorney of any of the Acquired Corporations, whether or not such director,
officer, controlled affiliate, agent or attorney is purporting to act on
behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations, shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of this Section 4.3 by the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a
director, officer, controlled affiliate, agent or attorney of an Acquired
Corporation, or any other Person, shall be deemed to have breached a provision
of this Section 4.3 if such director, officer, controlled affiliate, agent or
attorney or other Person takes any action that would constitute a breach by
the Company of such provision were the Company to take such action
directly. 

   

 (b) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, and the terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person during the Pre-Closing Period. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to: (i) the status of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; and (ii) the status and terms of any modification or proposed modification thereto. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. 

  

 (d) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire or similar Contract to which any of the Acquired Corporations is a party or under which any of the Acquired Corporations has any rights, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such agreement to be enforced at the request of Parent. The Company also shall promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality or similar agreement within the last 12 months in connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Transaction to return to the Acquired Corporations all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations or destroy such confidential information if expressly permitted by the terms of such confidentiality or other similar agreement. 

  

 (e) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any "standstill" provision or similar Contract to which any of the Acquired Corporations is a party or under which any of the Acquired Corporations has any rights, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such provision or other Contract to be enforced at the request of Parent; _provided, however,_ that prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, and without in any way limiting any of the provisions of Section 4.3(a), this Section 4.3(a) shall not prohibit the Company from waiving any "standstill" provision otherwise binding on any Person in response to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry made by such Person (and not withdrawn) if: (A) neither the Company nor any Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations shall have breached any of the provisions set forth in this Section 4.3 in connection with such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry in any way that has led to or otherwise facilitated or accelerated such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; (B) the board of directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Companys board of directors to the Companys stockholders or any Legal Requirement; and (C) prior to waiving such standstill provision, the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and of the Companys intention to waive such standstill provision.

requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 5.1. If

Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, then such party: (i) shall
promptly inform the other party thereof; (ii) shall provide the other party

withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent, and no resolution by the
board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof to withdraw the
Company Board Recommendation or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Parent shall be adopted (it being understood that the
Company Board Recommendation shall be deemed to have been modified in a
manner adverse to Parent should John Ocampo fail to vote in favor of any
reaffirmation of such recommendation, or the board of directors of the
Company otherwise formally takes any action that reasonably evidences that
fact that John Ocampo no longer supports the Mergers or the Contemplated
Transactions). Subject to Parents rights under Section 8 and the other
provisions of this Agreement: (A) nothing in this Section 5.2(b) shall
preclude the Company from making any accurate and complete public
disclosure of any material facts, including the fact that an Acquisition
Proposal has been submitted to or received by the Company, if: (1) the
Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such

shall preclude the Companys board of directors from complying with Rules

with regard to an Acquisition Proposal (except that the board of directors of
the Company shall not be permitted to withdraw the Company
Board Recommendation or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent except as specifically provided in Section 5.2(c)). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b), at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent, if: (i) the Companys board of directors determines: (A) that the Company has received a Superior Offer that has not been withdrawn; or (B) that: (1) a Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred since the date of this Agreement and is continuing; or (2) since the date of this Agreement, an event has occurred or circumstance exists that, in combination with any other events or circumstances since the date of this Agreement, would reasonably be expected to have or result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Companys board of directors under applicable law; and (iii) the Company shall have provided to Parent, at least five (5) days prior to any withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation, written notice of such proposed withdrawal or modification together with reasonably detailed information regarding the circumstances giving rise to such possible action.

 (d) The Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, making, announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, or by any withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation.

Parent shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Parent Shareholders Meeting are solicited in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 5.3(c): (i) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the effect that the board of directors of Parent recommends that Parents shareholders vote to approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the First Merger (the recommendation of Parents board of directors that Parents shareholders vote to approve the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the First Merger being referred to as the "Parent Board Recommendation"); and (ii) the Parent Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to the Company, and no resolution by the board of directors of Parent or any committee thereof to withdraw the Parent Board Recommendation or modify the Parent Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Company shall be adopted. Subject to the Companys rights under Section 8 and the other provisions of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.3(b) shall preclude Parent from making any accurate and complete public disclosure of any material facts if: (1) Parents board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Parents outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of Parents board of directors under applicable law; and (2) Parent shall have provided the Company with reasonable advance notice of the content of such disclosure.

Parent shall notify the Company promptly (and in any event within four hours) of any withdrawal of or modification to the Parent Board Recommendation. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Parents obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Parent Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.3(a) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by any withdrawal or modification of the Parent Board Recommendation. 

  

 5.4 Stock Options and Company ESPP. 

   

 (a) At the First Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the First Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall be converted into and become an option to purchase Parent Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent: (i) assuming such Company Option; or (ii) replacing such Company Option by issuing a replacement stock option equivalent in all material respects to purchase Parent Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company Option Plan and the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under Company Options assumed or replaced by Parent shall thereupon be converted into options to purchase Parent Common Stock, and accordingly, from and after the First Effective Time: (A) each Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company Option so assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time by the sum of: (1) the Exchange Ratio; plus (2) the decimal representing the fraction (x) whose numerator is the Per Share Cash Amount, and (y) whose denominator is the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date the First Merger becomes effective (the sum of "(1)" plus "(2)" being the "Option Exchange Ratio", which it is agreed shall be calculated to at least five decimal places), and rounding the resulting aggregate number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (C) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall be determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the First Effective Time, by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and (D) subject to the terms of the stock option agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced, any restriction on the exercise of any Company Option assumed or replaced by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of such Company Option; _provided, however,_  that following the First Effective Time, Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to each Company Option so assumed or replaced by Parent. 

  

 (b) At the First Effective Time, each Company PSA that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into and become a right to be issued Parent Common Stock, with such conversion effected through Parent: (i) assuming such Company PSA; or (ii) replacing such Company PSA by issuing a replacement stock right materially equivalent in all material respects to be issued Parent Common Stock in substitution therefor, in either case in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement) of the applicable Company Option Plan and the terms of the Company
PSA agreement by which such Company PSA is evidenced. All rights with respect
to Company Common Stock under Company PSAs assumed or replaced by Parent
shall thereupon be converted into rights to be issued Parent Common Stock,
and accordingly, from and after the First Effective Time: (A) each Company
PSA assumed or replaced by Parent will represent a right to be issued solely
shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each Company PSA so assumed or replaced by Parent shall be
determined by multiplying the number of unvested shares of Company Common
Stock that were subject to such Company PSA immediately prior to the First
Effective Time by Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting aggregate
number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and
(C) subject to the terms of the award agreement by which such Company PSA is
evidenced, any restriction on the issuance of shares under any Company PSA
assumed or replaced by Parent shall continue in full force and effect and the
term, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company PSA shall
otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption or replacement of
such Company PSA; _provided, however,_ that following the First Effective
Time, Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any
committee thereof with respect to each Company PSA so assumed or replaced by
Parent. 

   

 (c) Parent shall: (i) file with the SEC, no later than three business days after the date on which the First Merger becomes effective, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form), if available for use by Parent, or if a Form S-8 is not available for use by Parent, a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form), if available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Company Options and Company PSAs assumed or replaced by Parent in accordance with Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b); (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such assumed or replaced Company Options and Company PSAs remain outstanding; and (iii) deliver to each holder of a Company Option and Company PSA that is so assumed or replaced a written notice setting forth: (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Company Option or Company PSA; and (B) the exercise price per share payable to Parent upon the exercise of such Company Option. 

  

 (d) At the First Effective Time, Parent may (if Parent determines that it desires to do so) assume any or all of the Company Option Plans or merge any such Company Option Plans into any stock option plan of Parent. If Parent elects to so assume or merge any Company Option Plan, then, under such Company Option Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible under applicable Legal Requirements, using the share reserves of such Company Option Plan as of the First Effective Time (including any shares returned to such share reserves as a result of the termination of Company Options and Company PSAs that are assumed by Parent pursuant to Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b)), except that: (i) stock covered by such awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in such Company Option Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii) Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall 

   ##### 

  

 

succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Companys board of
directors or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of such
Company Option Plan. 

   

 (e) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may be reasonably necessary for the Company (under the Company Option Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of Section 1.5(c) and this Section 5.4 and to ensure that, from and after the First Effective Time, holders of Company Options, Company RSAs and Company PSAs have no rights with respect thereto other than those applicable rights specifically provided in Section 1.5(c), in this Section 5.4, in the applicable award agreements (as may be amended in connection with the Contemplated Transactions), and, subject to this Section 5.4, the Company Option Plans. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, the board of directors of the Company shall adopt resolutions providing that the treatment of the Company Options and Company PSAs under this Agreement shall constitute an assumption of such Company Options and Company PSAs for purposes of the Company Option Plans. 

  

 (f) Prior to the First Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that may be reasonably necessary, consistent with the terms of the Company ESPP, to: (i) cause any outstanding offering period under the Company ESPP to be terminated as of a date not later than the last business day prior to the date of the First Effective Time (such date, the "Designated Date"); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii) cause the exercise as of the Designated Date of each outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP; and (iv) provide that no further offering period or purchase period shall commence under the Company ESPP on or after the Designated Date; _provided, however_ , that the actions described in clauses "(i)" through "(iv)" of this sentence shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the First Merger. On the Designated Date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the First Effective Time (and subject to the consummation of the First Merger), the Company shall terminate the Company ESPP. In the event that the commencement of the next regularly scheduled offering period under the Parent ESPP is more than 90 days after the date on which the First Merger becomes effective, Parent will establish a special offering period for Continuing Employees under the Parent ESPP, which period shall commence as soon as administratively practicable following the First Effective Time and end on the date immediately prior to the date of commencement of the next regularly scheduled offering period under the Parent ESPP. 

  

 5.5 Employee Benefits. 

   

 (a) Parent agrees that, subject to any necessary transition period and subject to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal Requirements: (i) all employees of the Acquired Corporations who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the First Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") shall be eligible to participate in Parents health, vacation and 401(k) plans, to substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent; and (ii) for purposes of determining a Continuing Employees eligibility to participate in such plans, and 

   ##### 

  

 

for purposes of benefit accrual and accrual caps under any vacation plan or
policy, such Continuing Employee shall receive credit under such plans for
his or her years of continuous service with the Acquired Corporations prior
to the First Effective Time. Parent shall give effect, in determining any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations under any Parent
health insurance plans for the calendar year in which the First Effective
Time occurs, to amounts paid or incurred by such Continuing Employees during
the calendar year in which the First Effective Time occurs under comparable
Company Employee Plans maintained by the Company immediately prior to
the First Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that such obligation shall
apply only if, and to the extent, Parent causes the Surviving Corporation to
discontinue a Company Employee Plan that is a welfare benefit plan (within
the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) prior to the end of the calendar year
in which the First Effective Time occurs and covers Continuing Employees under
a comparable Parent plan for the remainder of such calendar year. 

   

 (b) Nothing in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Company Employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent. Except for Indemnified Persons (as defined in Section 5.6(a)) to the extent of their respective rights pursuant to Section 5.6, no Company Employee, and no Continuing Employee, shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. 

  

 (c) If requested by Parent at least five days prior to the Closing, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the First Merger becomes effective, any Company Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Companys board of directors of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent). The Company also shall take, prior to the First Effective Time, such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request. 

  

 (d) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to any of the Contemplated Transactions, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to ensure that such requirements are complied with prior to the First Effective Time. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain compliance with all applicable rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market in connection with all matters relating to equity compensation and employee benefit plans. 

  

 5.6 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

   

 (a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to), honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and officers identified in Part 2.10(a)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and any person who 

   ##### 

  

 

becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after
the date hereof and prior to the First Effective Time (but in the case of any
person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries after the date hereof and prior to the First Effective Time,
solely to the extent that the terms and conditions of any such
indemnification agreements are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to the
indemnification agreements to which similarly situated directors and officers
set forth in Part 2.10(a)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule are a party)
(each, an "Indemnified Person" and collectively, the "Indemnified
Persons"). In addition, during the period commencing at the First Effective
Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the First Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses,
covering acts and omissions of directors and officers (and any
other employees or agents who otherwise would be entitled to similar benefits
thereunder pursuant to the terms thereof in effect on the date hereof), in
each case in their respective capacities as such, occurring at or prior to
the First Effective Time, that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not
be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects their rights thereunder except as required by applicable Legal
Requirements. 

   

 (b) Prior to the First Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall be permitted to purchase a "tail" prepaid policy on the policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement in the form Made Available by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Existing DandO Policy") for a period of six years from the First Effective Time on terms and conditions with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the Existing DandO Policy, provided that the Company shall not pay any premiums for such "tail" prepaid policy in excess of $875,000 in the aggregate. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder for so long as such "tail" policy shall remain in full force and effect. 

  

 (c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall: (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be set forth in this Section 5.6. 

  

 (d) The obligations set forth in this Section 5.6 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the "tail" policy referred to in Section 5.6(b)) (and their heirs and representatives) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the "tail" policy referred to in Section 

   ##### 

  

 

5.6(b) and their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons
(and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party

 (i) by the Company if: (i) any of the Parent Specified Representations shall have been inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date), such that the condition set forth in Section 7.1 would not be satisfied (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of the Parent Specified Representations as of the date of this Agreement or as of any subsequent date, any update of or modification to the Parent Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made after the execution of this Agreement shall be disregarded); (ii) any of the Parent Other Representations shall have been inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date), in each case giving effect to clause "(b)" of the proviso to Section 7.2, such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2 would not be satisfied (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of the Parent Other Representations as of the date of this Agreement or as of any subsequent date, and for purposes of determining the accuracy of the Parent Other Representations for purposes of clause "(b)" of the proviso to Section 7.2: (A) all "Parent Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and other materiality qualifications (but not dollar thresholds) limiting the scope of the Parent Other Representations (other than the Parent Materiality Qualified Representations) shall be disregarded; (B) all "Parent Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and other materiality qualifications limiting the scope of the defined terms used in the Parent Other Representations shall be disregarded; and (C) any update of or modification to the Parent Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made after the execution of this Agreement shall be disregarded); or (iii) any of Parents covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 7.3 would not be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that if an inaccuracy in any of Parents representations and warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement or breach of a covenant or obligation by Parent is curable by Parent, and Parent is continuing to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(i) on account of such inaccuracy or breach unless such inaccuracy or breach shall remain uncured for a period of 30 days commencing on the date that the Company gives Parent notice of such inaccuracy or breach. 

 

The "End Date" shall be May 12, 2008; _provided, however,_ that: (i) if, on

7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.8, 7.12, 7.13 (other than with respect to the

Section 8.3 shall have been paid in full. 

   

 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect; _provided, however,_ that: (i) this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; (ii) the Joint Defense Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms; and (iii) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. 

   

 8.3 Expenses; Termination Fees. 

   

 (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Mergers are consummated.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Specified Acquisition Transaction" shall have the same meaning as the term "Acquisition Transaction," except that solely for purposes of the definition of Specified Acquisition Transaction all references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" shall be deemed to refer instead to "40%."

   ##### 

  

    

recapitalization, takeover offer, tender offer, exchange offer or other
similar transaction) which, if consummated in accordance with its terms,
would result in the holders of Parent Common Stock prior to the consummation
thereof holding less than 50% of the voting equity interests (outstanding as
of the consummation of such transaction) following the consummation thereof
(in each case, a "Parent Transaction") shall have been disclosed, announced,
commenced, submitted or made by such Specified Party at any time prior to the

of the Specified Party regarding such Parent Acquisition Proposal, a
reasonable person would believe that either: (A) the consummation of such
Parent Transaction was conditioned by such Specified Party on the termination
of this Agreement, or (B) the amount of consideration to be paid by such
Specified Party to holders of Parent Common Stock in such Parent Transaction
would be greater if this Agreement were terminated; (v) a final vote on the
approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the First Merger by
Parents shareholders shall not have been held; and (vi) either: (A) on or

of this Agreement, a definitive agreement providing for any Parent
Transaction involving such Specified Party or any affiliate of such Specified
Party (whether or not also involving one or more other parties) is entered

 (e) If: (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e); (ii) a Specified Party shall have publicly disclosed, publicly announced or otherwise publicly made a Parent Acquisition Proposal for a Parent Transaction at any time prior to the approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the First Merger by the Required Parent Shareholder Vote; (iii) based on statements made by or on behalf of the Specified Party that were publicly disclosed or announced regarding such Parent Acquisition Proposal, a reasonable person would believe that either: (A) the consummation of such Parent Transaction was conditioned by such Specified Party on the termination of this Agreement, or (B) the amount of consideration to be paid to holders of Parent Common Stock in such Parent 

   ##### 

  

    

Transaction would be greater if this Agreement were terminated; (iv) such
Parent Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly withdrawn by such
Specified Party on or before the date that is ten business days prior to the
date of the Parent Shareholders Meeting; and (v) either: (A) on or prior to
the first anniversary of such termination of this Agreement, any Parent
Transaction involving such Specified Party or any affiliate of such Specified
Party (whether or not also involving one or more other parties) is

of this Agreement, a definitive agreement providing for any Parent
Transaction involving such Specified Party or any affiliate of such Specified
Party (whether or not also involving one or more other parties) is entered
into and, following such first anniversary, such Parent Transaction is
consummated, then, within two business days after the consummation of
such Parent Transaction, Parent shall pay to the Company a nonrefundable fee
in the amount of $27,000,000 in cash. 

  

 (f) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f), or if this Agreement is otherwise terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1 following the occurrence of a Company Triggering Event, then the Company shall pay to Parent, at the time specified in the next sentence, a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $27,000,000 in cash. In the case of any such termination of this Agreement by the Company, the fee referred to in the preceding sentence shall be paid by the Company prior to the time of such termination; and in the case of any such termination of this Agreement by Parent, the fee referred to in the preceding sentence shall be paid by the Company within two business days after such termination. 

  

 (g) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g), or if this Agreement is otherwise terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1 following the occurrence of a Parent Triggering Event, then Parent shall pay to the Company, at the time specified in the next sentence, a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $27,000,000 in cash.

 (h) Under no circumstances shall Parent or the Company be entitled to receive more than one nonrefundable fee in the amount of $27,000,000 pursuant to this Section 8.3; _provided, however,_  that nothing in this Section 8.3(h) shall limit the obligations of each party to pay any amounts required to be paid by such party under Section 8.3(a) in addition to any nonrefundable fee required to be paid by such party. If a party fails to pay when due any amount that such party is required to pay under this Section 8.3, then: (i) such party shall reimburse the other party for all costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the enforcement by the other party of its rights under this Section 8.3; and (ii) such party shall pay to the other party interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid through the date such overdue amount is actually paid to the other party in full) at a rate per annum equal to the lower of: (i) the "prime rate" (as announced by Citibank, N.A. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid; or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.
