AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, is dated as of the 20th day of July, 2003
(as it may be amended from time to time hereafter, the " _Plan_ "), and is
entered into by and among PracticeWorks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), Eastman Kodak Company, a New Jersey corporation (" _Purchaser_
"), and Peach Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Purchaser (" _Acquisition Sub_ ").



 RECITALS:



(A) The respective Boards of Directors of Purchaser, Acquisition Sub and
the Company have approved the Plan and declared advisable the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into
the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein;



(B) The Company Board has determined that the acquisition of the Company by
the Purchaser as described herein is advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, the stockholders of the Company and has resolved to recommend
that the Plan be adopted by the stockholders of the Company;



(C) Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of the Plan, as a
condition and inducement to Purchasers and Acquisition Subs willingness to
enter into the Plan, all of the directors and executive officers, in their
capacity as stockholders of the Company, are entering into a voting and
irrevocable proxy agreement (the " _Stockholders  Agreement_") pursuant to
which, among other things, such stockholders will vote their shares of the
Companys capital stock in favor of the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by the Plan;



(D) Concurrently with its approval of the execution and delivery of the
Plan, the Company Board has taken action to ensure that, pursuant to the
Rights Agreement, dated as of November 6, 2002, between the Company and
StockTrans, Inc., as Rights Agent (the " _Company Rights Plan_ "):
(i) neither Purchaser nor Acquisition Sub will become an " _Acquiring Person_
" (as defined in the Company Rights Plan) as a result of the Plan, the Merger
or the Stockholders Agreement; (ii) no " _Share Acquisition Date_ " or "
_Distribution Date_ " (each as defined in the Company Rights Plan) will occur
as a result of the execution, delivery or approval by stockholders of the
Plan, the consummation of the Merger in accordance with the Plan or the
execution, delivery or performance of the Voting Agreement; and (iii) all
outstanding rights to purchase Series D Participating Cumulative Preferred
Stock of the Company issued and outstanding under the Company Rights Plan will
expire without further action or consideration as of the Effective Time; and



(E) Concurrently with its approval of the execution and delivery of the
Plan, the Company Board has taken such actions as may be required to cause
Section 203 of the DGCL not to apply to the Plan or the
transactions contemplated hereby and resolved that it will not withdraw,
revoke or modify its action in any manner which would cause Section 203 of the
DGCL or any other state takeover statute to become applicable to the Plan and
the transactions contemplated hereby.



In consideration of their mutual promises and obligations, the parties hereto
adopt and make the Plan and prescribe the terms and conditions thereof and the
manner and basis of carrying it into effect, as follows (capitalized terms are
used with the meanings ascribed thereto in the Plan at the locations noted in
Section 8.08(C)):



ARTICLE I 



 THE MERGER



   1.01. _ The_ |  | _Merger_. On the Effective Date: 
---|---|--- 



 (A) _ The Continuing Corporation_. Acquisition Sub shall merge with
and into the Company, the separate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease
and the Company (sometimes hereinafter referred to from and after the  



 

6 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Effective Time as the " _Continuing Corporation_ ") shall survive the
Merger. The name of the Continuing Corporation shall be "PracticeWorks, Inc."
The Continuing Corporation shall continue to be governed by the laws of the
State of Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of the Continuing
Corporation with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have
the effects specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_
").



 (B) _ Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors; Officers_. The
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Continuing Corporation shall
be those of the Acquisition Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The directors of Acquisition Sub in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Continuing Corporation and the
officers of Acquisition Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Continuing Corporation, in each case, together
with such other or additional directors and officers as may thereafter be
elected, who in the case of directors shall hold office until such time as
their successors are elected and qualified.



    1.02. _ Effective_ |  | _Date_. 
---|---|--- 



(A) If the conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or waived
in writing, the effective date (the " _Effective Date_ ") of the Merger shall
be the date of the Meeting as described in Section 5.02. If those conditions
have not been satisfied or waived on such date, the Effective Date shall occur
on such later date as the parties hereto mutually agree after such conditions
are satisfied or waived; provided, however, that if the parties are not able
to agree upon such date, the Effective Date shall be such date as Purchaser
shall notify the Company in writing not less than five (5) days prior
thereto, which date shall not be more than fifteen (15) days after the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the preceding, the occurrence of the Effective Date shall
be subject to the satisfaction or written waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in Article VI.



(B) Prior to or on the Effective Date, Acquisition Sub and the Company
shall execute and deliver to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
a certificate of merger, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto in
accordance with applicable law, specifying the date and time at which the
Merger shall become effective. The time on the Effective Date at which
the Merger becomes effective is referred to as the " _Effective Time_." On
the date of such filing, a closing shall be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern
Standard Time, on the Effective Date at such location as the parties hereto
shall otherwise agree.



ARTICLE II



CONSIDERATION



    2.01. _ Consideration_. Subject |  | to the provisions of
the Plan, at the Effective Time: 
---|---|--- 



 (A) _ Outstanding Acquisition Sub Common Stock_. Each of the shares
of Acquisition Sub common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall by virtue of the Merger, become and be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Company Common
Stock, which shall be owned by Purchaser, and which shall constitute all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company.



 (B) _ Outstanding Company Common Stock_. Each share (excluding shares
held by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (" _Excluded Shares_ ") and
Dissenting Shares) of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, become and be converted
solely into the right to receive from Purchaser $21.50 in cash without
interest (the " _Common Stock Merger Consideration_ ").



 

7 ##### Table of Contents

  

 (C) _ Outstanding Company Series B Preferred Stock_. Each share,
other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, of Company Series B
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, become and be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the greater of: (i) the
Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Companys Certificate of
Designation, Powers, Preferences and Rights of the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock, as filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on March 20,
2002 (the " _Certificate of Designation_ ")) of the Company Series B
Preferred Stock as of the Effective Time, plus an amount per share of Series B
Preferred Stock equal to the sum of (a) all dividends (whether or not
declared) accrued and unpaid thereon to the Effective Time to the extent not
already included in the Liquidation Preference, and (b) the amount of all
dividends that would accrue thereafter on such share if it were outstanding
through August 8, 2006; or (ii) an amount per share that would be distributed
among the holders of Company Series B Preferred Stock pro rata based on the
number of Shares of Company Common Stock that such holders would receive
assuming conversion of all outstanding shares of the Company Series
B Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 7 of the Certificate of Designation, as
such Certificate of Designation may subsequently be amended (the " _Preferred
Stock Merger Consideration_ "). The Common Stock Merger Consideration and
the Preferred Stock Merger Consideration are sometimes referred to herein
collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_."



 2.02. _ _ _Stockholder Rights_ __. At the Effective Time, other
than pursuant to Section 2.06, holders of Company Common Stock and Series
B Preferred Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
stockholders of the Company, or other rights except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration provided under this Article II, without interest.



    2.03. __ _ Exchange_ |  | _Agent and Exchange Procedures_. 
---|---|--- 



(A) Purchaser shall designate StockTrans, Inc. to act as exchange agent and
paying agent for the exchange of the certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock for the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of the certificates for the Company Common Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Purchaser will, on or prior to
the Effective Time, deposit with the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration
to be paid in respect of the Company Common Stock, Company Series B Preferred
Stock and Company Derivative Securities.



(B) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, the
Exchange Agent shall mail or cause to be mailed to each person who was a
holder of record of shares of the Company Common Stock or Company Series B
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Effective Time:
(i) a letter of transmittal; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the certificates representing the Company Common Stock held by
such holder (the " _Common Stock Certificates_ ") nominally representing the
Company Common Stock; or (iii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the certificates representing the Company Series B Preferred
Stock held by such holder (the " _Series B Preferred Stock Certificates_ ")
nominally representing the Company Series B Preferred Stock.



(C) The Merger Consideration will be delivered to holders of Common Stock
Certificates and holders of Series B Preferred Stock Certificates only upon
such holders delivery to the Exchange Agent of: (i) properly completed and
duly executed transmittal materials as described in Section 2.03(B) (in the
form provided by the Exchange Agent); and (ii) the certificates representing
all of such shares of Company Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock,
as the case may be, or an indemnity in form and substance satisfactory to the
Purchaser and the Exchange Agent, in their reasonable judgment, if any of such
certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed. Promptly after such delivery, the
Exchange Agent shall mail its check to the address specified by the holder in
the letter of transmittal in the aggregate amount of the Common Stock Merger
Consideration for the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by such
holder immediately prior to the Effective Time or the aggregate amount of the
Preferred Stock Merger Consideration for the number of shares of Company
Series B Preferred Stock held  



 

8 ##### Table of Contents

  

 by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time. No interest will be
paid or shall accrue on the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of
any such certificates. The Exchange Agent shall prepare and mail to each
holder to whom Merger Consideration has been sent the appropriate Form 1099B.



(D) Any amount of the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to
the holders of the Company Common Stock and the Company Series B Preferred
Stock for a period of six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Purchaser by the Exchange Agent upon demand, and any former
stockholders of the Company who have not previously complied with this
Section 2.03 shall thereafter look only to Purchaser for payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration.



(E) Neither the Exchange Agent, nor any of the Company, Acquisition Sub or
Purchaser shall be liable to any holder of shares of the Company Common Stock
or the Company Series B Preferred Stock with respect to any amount of the
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law, rule, regulation, statute, order,
judgment or decree.



(F) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and no transfer of shares of the Company Common Stock or Series B
Preferred Stock shall be made thereafter. In the event that, after the
Effective Time, Company Common Stock Certificates or Series B Preferred Stock
Certificates are presented to Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation in
compliance with this Section 2.03, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.03, subject
to applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares.



 2.04. _Excluded Shares_. Each of the Excluded Shares shall be
canceled and retired at the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be
issued in exchange therefor.



 2.05. _Stock Options and Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Stock Option, Company Warrant, and Company Deferred Stock
Grant (collectively, " _Company Derivative Securities_ "), whether or not
exercisable or issuable (in the case of outstanding Company Deferred Stock
Grants) at the Effective Time and regardless of the respective exercise (or
base) prices thereof, if any, subject to the terms and conditions of the
Companys 2000 Stock Option Plan, as amended to date, or other applicable
governing document, will be addressed pursuant to the following provisions:



(A) (i) Each Company Stock Option with an exercise (or base) price less
than the per share Common Stock Merger Consideration; (ii) each Company
Warrant with an exercise (or base) price less than the per share Common Stock
Merger Consideration; and (iii) each Company Deferred Stock Grant, in
each case whether vested or unvested or subject to any other restrictions at
the Effective Time shall be converted into an obligation of the Purchaser to
pay, and the right of the holder thereof to receive, in full satisfaction of
each such Company Derivative Security, cash in an amount equal to: (a) in the
case of each share of Company Common Stock underlying each Company Stock
Option and Company Warrant, the excess of the Common Stock Merger
Consideration per share over the exercise price of such Company Derivative
Security, and (b) in the case of each share of Company Common Stock underlying
each Company Deferred Stock Grant, the Common Stock Merger Consideration.



(B) Each Company Derivative Security with an exercise (or base) price equal
to or greater than the per share Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time and be of no further effect.



(C) The Company Board shall take such actions prior to the Effective Time
as may be necessary to cause the Company Derivative Securities to be treated
as described in (A) and (B) above as of the Effective Time including, as
necessary, amending the plans and agreements under which the Company Stock
Options, Company Deferred Stock Grants and Company Warrants have been
issued and, to the extent required under the terms of the Derivative
Securities or the plans under which they were issued, obtaining the consent of
the holders of the Company Derivative Securities to the amendments of the
plans and agreements.

 



 

9 ##### Table of Contents

  

(D) As soon as practicable and in any event no more than five (5) business
days after the Effective Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent
to send to the holders of all certificates previously representing Company
Derivative Securities: (i) a transmittal letter (the " _Derivative Security
Transmittal Letter_ "); and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering any
certificates, instruments or agreements representing the Company Derivative
Securities; provided, however, that with respect to the exchange and payment

and the Company Subsidiaries has in effect all federal, state, local, and
foreign governmental authorizations necessary for it to own or lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now conducted,
except for such authorizations, the absence of which is not reasonably likely

ARTICLE V



 

COVENANTS



The Company hereby covenants to Purchaser and to Acquisition Sub, and
Purchaser and Acquisition Sub hereby covenant to the Company, as applicable,
that:



 5.01. _ Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan,
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or
advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as
promptly as reasonably practicable and to otherwise enable consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and shall cooperate fully with each other
to that end. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use best efforts to
obtain the consent or approval of all persons party to a Significant Contract
with the Company, to the extent such consent or approval is required in order
for the Continuing Corporation to receive the benefits thereof.

 



 5.02. _ Company Proxy Statement; Stockholder Approval_. As promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, but in all cases on or
before the 20th business day after the date of the Plan, the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement (the " _Proxy Statement_ "),
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly
as practicable to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto
and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Series B Preferred Stock in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable following the date
hereof. The Company shall notify Purchaser as soon as reasonably
practicable upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement, and shall provide Purchaser with copies of all correspondence
between the Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and
its staff, on the other hand. In connection with the foregoing, the Company
shall call a special meeting (the " _Meeting_ ") of the holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Series B Preferred Stock to be held as soon as
practicable for purposes of voting upon the approval of the Plan, and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to the provisions of
Section 5.06) to solicit and obtain votes of the holders of Company Common
Stock and Company Series B Preferred Stock in favor of the approval of the
Plan. The Company Board shall recommend approval of the Plan by such holders,
unless the Company Board has complied with Section 5.06 and determines in
good faith after receiving written advice from outside legal counsel, given in
good faith, that withdrawal of its recommendation is required in order for its
directors to comply with their fiduciary duties under applicable law. 



 5.03. _ Compliance with Securities Laws_. The Company shall ensure
that the Proxy Statement and all amendments or supplements thereto (A) will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any other applicable statutory or
regulatory requirements, and (B) will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Company be liable for any untrue statement of a
material fact or omission to state a material fact in the Proxy Statement made
in reliance upon, and in conformity with, written information concerning
Purchaser or Acquisition Sub furnished by or on behalf of Purchaser or
Acquisition Sub by an authorized representative specifically for use in the
Proxy Statement.



 5.04. _ Press Releases_. The Company will not, without the prior
approval of Purchaser (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and Purchaser and Acquisition Sub will not, without the prior
approval of the Company (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), issue any press release or written statement for general circulation
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, or otherwise publicly
disclose the terms and conditions of such transactions, except as otherwise
required by law. It is anticipated that the first public announcement of the
Plan or the transactions contemplated hereby will be a joint press release of
the Company and Purchaser, acceptable to both parties, after the execution and
delivery of the Plan.

 5.05. _ Access; Information_. From and after the date of the Plan:



(A) Subject to applicable law and preservation of the attorney-client
privilege, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries to afford Purchaser and its officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized representatives, full and complete access,
during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all of its properties, books, contracts and records, audit and tax
work papers, personnel, professional advisors and such other persons or
matters as Purchaser may reasonably request.



(B) Purchaser will not use any information obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.05 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Plan and planning the post-acquisition activities of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and, if the Plan is terminated, will
hold all information and documents obtained pursuant to this paragraph in
confidence (as provided in Section 8.06) unless and until such time as: (i)
such information or documents become publicly available other than by reason
of any action or failure to act by Purchaser; (ii) any such information or
document is required by law or applicable published stock exchange rule to be
disclosed; or (iii) Purchaser must provide such information in response to an
examination or similar request of a Governmental Authority charged with
supervision of it or any of its subsidiaries (subject to prior notice to, and
consultation with, the Company). In the event of the termination of the Plan,
Purchaser will, upon request by the Company, deliver to the Company all
documents so obtained by Purchaser or confirm to the Company that all such
documents have been destroyed. All parties hereto acknowledge that the letter
agreement dated June 20, 2003, between the Company and Purchaser (the "
_Letter Agreement_ "), remains in full force and effect, and that the
provisions of this Section 5.05 remain subject to the terms and conditions of
such agreement.



(C) As soon as practicable after the close of each month, but not later
than the 15th of the month, commencing with the financial statements for the
month ending July 31, 2003, the Company will provide the Purchaser with
copies of its unaudited consolidating and consolidated financials statements
for such month each of which shall be complete and accurate and prepared in
conformity with the Companys Financial Statements, consistently applied. 



 5.06. _ Acquisition Proposals_. In the case of the Company, it shall
not, and it shall cause the Company Subsidiaries, the directors, officers,
or employees of the Company or any of Company Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective attorneys, bankers, accountants, agents or other advisors
(collectively, the " _Company Representatives_ ") not to, solicit or encourage
inquires or proposals with respect to, or furnish any nonpublic information
relating to or participate in any negotiations or discussions concerning, any
acquisition or purchase of all or a substantial portion of the assets of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any merger or other business
combination with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries other than as
contemplated by the Plan; and the Company shall notify Purchaser immediately
if and the terms of any such inquiries or proposals are received by, or any
such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated with, the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries. All pending negotiations or discussions by
Company Representatives have been terminated and the Companys confidential
information has been destroyed and returned as provided in the applicable
confidentiality agreement. Nothing in the Plan will prevent the Company or the
Company Board from: (i) providing information in response to a request
therefore by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written proposal
for an acquisition or purchase of the type described in the preceding
sentence; or (ii) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person
who has made such an unsolicited bona fide written proposal, if and only to
the extent that, in each such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii), the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors) that the proposal could reasonably result in a transaction more
favorable to the holders of shares, as a group in their capacity as
shareholders of Company Common Stock, from a financial point of view than the
Merger or if counsel to the Company advises the Company Board of Directors
that the failure to furnish information, negotiate or enter into appropriate
agreements with such person could reasonably be expected to subject the
Companys directors to liability for breach of their fiduciary duties or
for failure to conform to the requirements of the securities laws, in each
case subject to the provisions of Article VII. If negotiations or discussions
are initiated in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Company agrees
that it will notify Purchaser immediately.

 5.07. _Regulatory Applications_. Each of the parties hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and submit (and in any
event, within twenty (20) business days after the date of the Plan or such
shorter period as may be required by Applicable Law), applications to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities responsible for competition or antitrust
matters for approval of or non-objection to the Merger, including filings
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, as amended (" _HSR_ ") and any other
competition or antitrust filing required to be filed as a result of the
execution and delivery of the Plan or as a condition to the consummation of
the Merger in the European Union or any member state thereof or other
jurisdiction (collectively with the filings under HSR, the " _Competition
Filings_ ").



The parties will cooperate in good faith to identify as soon as
practicable (and in any event, within ten (10) days after the date of the
Plan), all of the Competition Filings or any other appropriate filings to
secure all other approvals, consents and rulings which are necessary for the

the Plan, use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file all necessary
permits, consents, orders, approvals and authorizations of, or any exemption
by, all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Plan. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, the parties shall use their best efforts to
resolve any objections as may be asserted with respect to the Competition
Filings, provided, however, in that no event shall Purchaser or the Company be
required, in order to secure the consents, approvals or absence of
objections under the Competition Filings, as applicable, be required to limit
or divest any existing business activity or engage in litigation. Each of the
Company and Purchaser shall, to the extent practicable, consult with the
other, subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to all written information submitted to, any regulatory
authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Plan. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it
will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all
material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and regulatory authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Plan and each party will keep the other party
apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing sentence, the Purchaser and Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly inform the other of any
material communication from the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. If any such party receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger and transactions contemplated hereby,
then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other parties,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

a series of related claims, claimed then wherein the amount of damages if
reasonably estimable, exceeds $100,000 or any significant documents or
pleadings to be made or received in any such pending litigation; (v) any event
or condition that would cause any of the Companys representations or
warranties set forth herein not to be true and correct as of the Effective

or any warning letters, recall notices, field notifications or alerts from
the FDA or any Non-U.S. Governmental or quasi-Governmental Authority.



(B) Purchaser shall notify the Company of: (i) any event or condition that
would cause any of Purchasers representations or warranties set forth herein
not to be true and correct as of the Effective Date or prevent Purchaser from
fulfilling its obligations hereunder; or (ii) of any denial of any application
filed by Purchaser with any Governmental Authority with respect to the Plan.

arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Date (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by the
Plan) to the extent such persons are entitled to indemnification under the
DGCL, the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws and pursuant
to indemnification agreements, as in effect on the date hereof, including
provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in the defense of any
litigation.



(B) The Company shall secure " _tail_ " or " _run-off_ " coverage under its
existing directors and officers liability insurance policy, containing

the cost of maintaining such coverage will exceed one hundred fifty percent
(150%) of the premium for the policy period in effect as of the Effective

The parties acknowledge that the cost of such " _tail_ " or " _run-off_ "
coverage shall not be required to be included in the budget for 2003 set forth
on Schedule 3.0(L) of the Disclosure Letter.



(C) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
5.09(A), upon learning of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof, provided, that the
failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of Purchaser and the
Continuing Corporation under Section 5.09(A) unless and to the extent such
failure impairs the ability of the Purchaser to obtain coverage for the action
under its insurance or the ability of the Purchaser to defend the claim. In
the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Date), (i) the Continuing
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, if it so
elects, and (ii) if the Continuing Corporation fails to assume such defense
in a reasonable period of time after notice from the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party may, on notice to Purchaser and the Continuing Corporation,
conduct its own defense, and the Continuing Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly
as statements therefore are received.



 5.10. _ Certain Tax Elections_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective
Date or the due date under the Code, the Company shall file or cause to be

 8.09. _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The Plan
and all Schedules, Exhibits and Annexes hereto represents the entire
understanding of the parties hereto with reference to the transactions
contemplated hereby and supersede any and all other oral or written agreements
heretofore made other than the Letter Agreement, which shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (except as contemplated in the
Letter Agreement to be superseded by this Plan). Nothing in the Plan,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any person, other than the
parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of the Plan, except
that Section 5.09 is intended to confer on the persons named therein those
rights expressly stated in such Section.



 8.10. _Employee Matters_. Employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time shall continue to be generally entitled:
(A) to participate in the Compensation and Benefit Plans of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries in which the employees participate prior to the
Effective Time; or (B) to benefits and compensation which in the aggregate are
substantially equivalent to such benefits and compensation, for at least
twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, provided that nothing in the
Plan or this Section 8.10 shall constitute a promise or guaranty of employment
for such twelve- (12) month period or any period or to convert any employee
from an employee whose employment is terminable at will, with or without
cause. To the extent that employees of the Company and Company Subsidiaries
are provided benefits under employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by or contributed to by Purchaser and its affiliates during such
twelve-month period after the Effective Date (" _Purchaser s Benefit
Plans_"), Purchaser shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, cause each such
plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior service with the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries of each such employee immediately prior to the
Effective Date as service rendered to Purchaser or its affiliates, as the case
may be, for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting thereunder
(but not benefit accrual except with respect to vacation benefits) to a
substantially similar extent as such service is recognized under corresponding
plans, programs or arrangements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Date; and the Purchaser shall cause such Purchaser
Benefit Plan, to the extent possible under the terms of such benefits plans,
to (i) give credit to such employees for any deductible or out-of-pocket
amounts paid by such employees under the corresponding Company Compensation
and Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the change occurs; and (ii) waive
any preexisting condition limitation that was waived or satisfied under the
terms of the Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Date and
apply any waiting period limitations that would otherwise be applicable to
such employee on or after the Effective Date in a manner consistent with the
way Purchaser and its affiliates would treat similarly situated employees of
Purchaser and its affiliates taking into consideration the service such
employees had with the Company and Company Subsidiaries.



 8.11. _Heading_. The headings contained in the Plan are for reference
purposes only and are not part of the Plan.



 8.12 _Interpretation; Effect_. When a reference is made in the Plan
to Sections, Exhibits, Annexes or Schedules, such reference shall be to a
Section of, or Exhibit or Annex or Schedule to, the Plan unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words " _include_ ," " _includes_ " or " _including_ "
are used in the Plan, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "
_without limitation_ ", no provision of the Plan shall be construed to require
the Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries, affiliates or
directors to take any action which would violate applicable law (whether
statutory or common law), rule or regulation.



 8.13 _Binding Effect_. This Plan and the obligations and covenants
hereunder that survive the Effective Time, including obligations of and
relating to the Continuing Corporation, shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.
