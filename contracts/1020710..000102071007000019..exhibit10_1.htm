* From  and after the Closing Date, the Selling Stockholders shall not and shall cause  their directors, officers and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,  disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than authorized  officers, directors and employees of Purchaser or use or otherwise exploit  for  its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than Purchaser, any  Confidential Information (as defined below). The Selling Stockholders  shall not have any obligation to keep confidential (or cause its officers,  directors or Affiliates to keep confidential) any Confidential Information  if  and to the extent disclosure thereof is specifically required by applicable  Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event disclosure is required by  applicable Law, the Selling Stockholders shall, to the extent reasonably  possible, provide Purchaser with prompt notice of such requirement prior to  making any disclosure so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective  order. For purposes of this _Section 6.7(c)_ , " ** _Confidential Information_** " means any information with  respect to Purchaser, the Company or

* The  covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 6.7_ relate to  matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a  violation of any of the terms of this _Section 6.7_ will cause  irreparable injury to Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries (as  applicable), the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or determine  and  which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at  law for any breach of this _Section 6.7_ will be  inadequate. Therefore, Purchaser and the Company will be entitled to  a temporary and permanent injunction, restraining order or other equitable  relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach  of  this _Section 6.7_ without the necessity of proving actual damage or  posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this  _Section 6.7_ are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and  remedies which Purchaser may have hereunder or at law or in  equity. In the event that Purchaser were to seek damages for any  breach of this _Section 6.7_, the portion of the consideration  delivered to the Selling Stockholders hereunder which is allocated by the  parties to the foregoing covenant shall not be considered a measure of or limit  on such damages.

 

 

* The  parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction determines  that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a specified  business limitation or any other relevant feature of this _Section 6.7_ is  unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser period of time,  geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature which is  determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public  policy may be enforced against the applicable party.

on the date of this Agreement  relating to the respective businesses of the
Company and the Subsidiaries for  a  period of seven (7) years from the
Closing Date and shall make such records  and  personnel available to the
other as may be reasonably required by such party  in  connection with,
among other things, any insurance claims by, legal proceedings  against or
governmental investigations of the Selling Stockholders, the Company,  the
Subsidiaries or Purchaser or any of their Affiliates or in order to enable

(including from and after the  Closing Date when Purchaser has purchased the
Company and its Subsidiaries  pursuant hereto), and the employment of such
employees shall be on terms and  conditions, including in respect of benefits
and other compensation programs,  no  less favorable, in the aggregate, than
as those that the Company and its  Subsidiaries provides as of the date

such employee benefit programs provided or  otherwise maintained by Purchaser
generally for its employees to which Purchaser  transfers the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (if any transfer  shall occur) shall not
deny such employees coverage on the basis of pre-existing  conditions (and
shall not require any conditional screening or testing for  purposes thereof)

pocket expenses paid in the year of such transfer in  the  employee benefit
programs of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

 

1.74 _Notification  of Certain Matters_. The Selling Stockholders shall give
notice to  Purchaser and Purchaser shall give notice to the Selling
Stockholders, as  promptly as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of

prior to the Closing, (b) any material failure on its part  to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied  with or

the parties  hereto.

Company shall also make  arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser
for such holders to provide  to  Purchaser recordable form mortgage and lien

Purchaser prior to the Closing such that  all  Liens on the assets or
properties of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries  that  are not
Permitted Exceptions shall be satisfied, terminated and discharged  on or 
prior to the Closing Date. On the Closing Date prior to the Closing,  the
Company shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate of the Company setting

named by the  Controlling Owner shall be subject to (a) the rules and
requirements of  applicable Law as well as the rules and regulation
promulgated by the United  States Securities and Exchange Commission and by
any other self-regulatory  organization applicable to Purchaser's securities
and governance obligations in  respect thereof and (b) such person's meeting

1.82 _Indemnification  Procedures_.

 

 

* A  claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third party claim  may  be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought;  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to so notify the indemnifying  shall not preclude the indemnified party from any indemnification which it  may  claim in accordance with this _Article VIII_.

 

 

* In  the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any claim  or  demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which indemnification  may be sought under _Section 8.2_ hereof (regardless of the limitations set  forth in _Section 8.4_ ) (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** "),  the indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion  of  any Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this  indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The failure of  the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim  shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party's  obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the indemnifying  party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such  failure. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 8.3_,  the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be  represented by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory  to  the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise  deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against  hereunder; _provided_ that the indemnifying party shall have acknowledged  in writing to the indemnified party its unqualified obligation (subject to  the  limitations of _Section 8.4_ ) to indemnify the indemnified party as  provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to defend  against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which  relates to any Losses indemnified by it hereunder, it shall within five days  of  the indemnified party's written notice of the assertion of such Third Party  Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires) notify  the  indemnified party of its intent to do so; _provided_ , that the indemnifying  party must conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently  thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this regard. If the  indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise  deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against  hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its election as herein  provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for  such  Losses under this Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against,  negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If  the indemnified party defends any Third Party Claim, then the indemnifying  party  shall reimburse the indemnified party for the expenses of defending such Third  Party Claim upon submission of periodic bills. If the indemnifying  party shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party  may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party  Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that such indemnified party shall be  entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense  of the indemnifying party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to  participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the indemnified  party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnified party  and  the indemnifying party that would make such separate representation advisable;  and _provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying party shall not be  required

 

 

* to  pay for more than one such counsel for all indemnified parties in connection  with any Third Party Claim. The parties hereto agree to provide  reasonable access to the other to such documents and information as may be  reasonably requested in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement  of any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section 8.3_ to the contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the  indemnified party shall, without the written consent of the other party, settle  or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry  of  any judgment unless the claimant or claimants and such party provide to such  other party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of the Third  Party Claim. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any Third  Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such  payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to any insurance  benefits or other claims of the indemnified party with respect to such Third  Party Claim.

 

 

* After  any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental  Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal  therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the indemnified  party  (or the Stockholder Representative, in the case of a claim for indemnification  for which payment may be sought under _Section 8.2(b)_ , and the  indemnifying party (or, in the case of a claim for indemnification for which  payment may be sought under _Section 8.2(a)_ , the Stockholder  Representative) shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect  to a claim for indemnification hereunder, the indemnified party (or, as  applicable, the Stockholder Representative) shall forward to the indemnifying  party (or, in the case of a claim for indemnification for which payment may  be  sought under _Section 8.2(a)_ , the Stockholder Representative) notice of  any sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement  with  respect to such matter.

 

 

* Following  the determination of any applicable amount that the Selling Stockholders shall  be obligated to indemnify pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(i)_ or  _8.2(a)(ii)_ , the Stockholder Representative shall (i) promptly direct,  in  accordance with _Section 8.6_ , the Escrow Agent to distribute to the  applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party such amount in satisfaction of such  obligations and (ii) to the extent such applicable amounts are not within the  Cap but are properly payable pursuant to _Sections 8.2_ and _8.4_ ,  notify the Selling Stockholders so that payment may be made to the applicable  Purchaser Indemnified Party by each such Selling Stockholder in satisfaction  of  its respective obligations under _Section 8.2(a)_.

 

 

1.83 _Limitations  on Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) An  indemnifying party shall not have any liability under _Section
8.2(a)(i)_   hereof unless the aggregate amount of Losses incurred by the
indemnified parties  and indemnifiable thereunder based upon, attributable to
or resulting from  the  failure of any of the representations or warranties
to be true and correct  exceeds $1,000,000 (the " ** _Rep Basket_** ") and,
in such  event, the indemnifying party shall be required to pay only the
amount of such  Losses in excess of $250,000 (the " ** _Rep Deductible_**

amount of Losses incurred  by Purchaser Indemnified Parties and indemnifiable
thereunder based upon,  attributable to or resulting from the breach of any
Pre-Closing Covenant on  the  part of the Company or any Selling
Stockholders exceeds $100,000 (the " ** _Covenant Basket_** ") and, in such
event the Selling  Stockholders shall be required to pay the amount of such
Losses only to the  extent of such excess. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing  provisions to the contrary, to the extent that any liability for
indemnification  by the Selling Stockholders based upon, attributable to or
resulting from a  breach of a Pre-Closing Covenant on the part of the Company
or any Selling  Stockholders is also covered under this Agreement under
indemnification  obligations of the Selling Stockholders relating to a breach
of a representation  or warranty of the Selling Stockholders, then such
liability shall be deemed  to  arise and be incurred pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)(i)_ and, thus, be subject  to the Rep Basket and Rep Deductible for
purposes of the limitations set forth  in this _Section 8.4_.

 

 

(a) The  Selling Stockholders shall not be required to indemnify any Person
under  _Sections 8.2(a)(i)_ and _8.2(a)(ii)_ for an aggregate amount of 
Losses exceeding an amount equal to $5,000,000 of the Purchase Price (the "
** _Cap_** "); _provided_ that there shall be no Cap with  respect to Losses
related to breaches of any representations or warranties  contained in
_Sections 3.1_ (Organization), _3.2_ (Authorization),  _3.4_ (Ownership),
_3.6_ (Financial Advisors), _4.1_   (Organization), _4.2_ (Authorization),
_4.4_ (Capitalization),  _4.5_ (Subsidiaries), _4.10_ (Taxes) and _4.29_
(Financial  Advisors) of this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, (i) no Selling
Stockholder, other than the  Controlling Owner, shall be liable for
indemnification obligations in an amount  in excess of its respective portion
of the Purchase Price received (or, in  respect of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, receivable) pursuant hereto and (ii)  the  Trust shall have no
liability for indemnification obligations  hereunder

 

 

(c) The  amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this _Article  VIII_ shall be net of any (i) amounts actually recovered by
the indemnified  party pursuant to any indemnification by or indemnification
or other agreement  with any third party or (ii) insurance proceeds or other
cash receipts or  sources of reimbursement actually received (in each case,
net of any costs  of  collection or increased premiums relating thereto);
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that clause (ii) shall apply only if the effect of
such  provision does not constitute an impermissible waiver of the insurer's
rights of  subrogation against the indemnifying party. The parties
acknowledge  and agree that nothing in this _Section 8.4(e)_ shall (i) create
an  obligation of any party to maintain any form or level of insurance or
other  arrangements after the Closing, (ii) name any other party as an
additional  indemnitee, insured or other party or (iii) obtain approval for
any waiver  of  rights of subrogation.

 

 

(d) For  purposes of calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality or
Material Adverse  Effect qualifications in the representations, warranties,
covenants and  agreements shall be disregarded.

 

 

(e) The  Selling Stockholders shall have no right of contribution or other
recourse  against the Company or the Subsidiaries or their respective
directors, officers,  employees, Affiliates, agents, attorneys,
representatives, assigns or successors  for any Third

 

 

(f) Party  Claims asserted by Purchaser Indemnified Parties, it being
acknowledged and  agreed that the covenants and agreements of the Company are
solely for the  benefit of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties.

* _Tax  Indemnification_. The Selling Stockholders hereby agree to be  liable for and to indemnify and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Parties harmless  from and against, and pay to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties the amount of,  any and all Losses respect of (i) all Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries  (or any predecessor thereof) (A) for any taxable period ending on or before  the  Closing Date, and (B) for the portion of any Straddle Period ending at the  close  of business on the Closing Date (determined as provided in _Section  8.5(d)_ ); (ii) any and all Taxes imposed on any member of a consolidated,  combined or unitary group of which the Company or any Subsidiary (or any  predecessor thereof) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, by  reason of the liability of the Company or any Subsidiary (or any predecessor  thereof), pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) (or any  predecessor or successor thereof or any analogous or similar provision under  state, local or foreign Law); (iii) the failure of any of the representations  and warranties contained in _Section 4.10_ to be true and correct in all  respects or the failure to perform any covenant contained in this Agreement  with  respect to Taxes; (iv) any recapture of Nebraska LB 775 tax credits from the  Company due to the failure to meet or maintain the requirements of LB 775 prior  to the Closing Date; and (v) any Taxes resulting from, arising out of or based  on the Section 338(h)(10) Election (as defined in _Section  8.5(b))_.

 

 

* _338(h)(10)  Election_.

 

 

* The  Selling Stockholders shall join with Purchaser in making an election under  Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and any  corresponding or similar elections under state, local or foreign tax law  (collectively, the " ** _Section 338(h)(10) Election_** ") with  respect to the Company and each of the Subsidiaries. For the purpose  of making the Section 338(h)(10) Election for federal income Tax purposes,  on or  prior to the Closing Date, the Selling Stockholders shall deliver to Purchaser  an executed original IRS Form 8023 (or successor form). If no Section  338(h)(10) Election is to be made, the Form 8023 will be returned to the Selling  Stockholders within 120 days after the Closing Date. If a Section  338(h)(10) Election is to be made, Purchaser will file the Form 8023 with the  IRS. At least 30 days prior to the due date of such form Purchaser  will provide the Stockholder Representative a copy of the proposed Form 8023  and  all attachments thereto and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith with the  Stockholder Representative concerning any reasonable adjustments  thereto.

 

 

* Purchaser  shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all forms and documents  required to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Election. In addition  to the Form 8023, the Selling Stockholders shall execute (or cause to be  executed) and deliver to Purchaser such additional documents or forms as are  reasonably requested to complete properly the Section 338(h)(10) Election at  least 15 days prior to the date such Section 338(h)(10) Election is required  to  be filed.

 

 

* Purchaser  and the Selling Stockholders shall file, and shall cause their Affiliates to  file, all Tax Returns and statements, form and schedules in connection therewith  in a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take  no  position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax  Laws.

 

 

* If  Purchaser notifies the Selling Stockholders of its intent to make a Section  338(h)(10) Election, the allocation statement set forth on _Schedule  8.5(b)_ (the " ** _Allocation Statement_** "), which allocates  the Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as additional Purchase  Price for tax purposes among the Company and the Subsidiaries and among the  different items of assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, shall be  applicable. All Tax Returns and reports filed by Purchaser, the  Selling Stockholders and their respective Affiliates shall be prepared  consistently with such Allocation Statement.

 

 

* _Filing  of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 

 

* The  Company shall (and shall cause the Subsidiaries to) timely file all Tax Returns  required to be filed by it on or prior to the Closing Date and shall pay or  cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon. All such Tax Returns  shall be prepared in all material respects in a manner consistent with prior  practice. The Company shall provide Purchaser with copies of such  completed Tax Returns at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing  thereof, along with supporting workpapers, for Purchaser's review and  approval. The Selling Stockholders and Purchaser shall attempt in  good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to  the  due date for filing. In the event that the Selling Stockholders and  the Purchaser are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Return  at least ten days prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be  resolved pursuant to _Section 8.5(g)_ , which resolution shall be binding on  the parties.

 

 

* Following  the Closing, Purchaser shall cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns required  to be filed by the Company and the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date and,  subject to the rights to payment from the Selling Stockholders under  _Section 8.5(c)(iii)_, pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due  thereon; _provided_ that, if an applicable Tax Return sets forth Taxes for  which the Selling Stockholders are responsible (including, without limitation,  as an indemnification obligation under this _Section 8.5_ ) then Purchaser  shall provide a copy of such Tax Return to the Stockholder Representative at  least ten (10) days prior to filing and shall negotiate in good faith with  the  Stockholder Representative concerning any reasonable adjustments  thereto.

 

 

* Not  later than ten (10) days prior to the due date for the payment of Taxes on  any  Tax Returns which Purchaser has the responsibility to cause to be filed pursuant  to _Section 8.5(c)(ii)_ , the Selling Stockholders shall pay to Purchaser or  the applicable Governmental Body the amount of Taxes, as reasonably determined  by Purchaser, owed by the Selling Stockholders pursuant to the provisions of  _Section 8.5(a)_. No payment pursuant to this  _Section 8.5(c)(iii)_ shall excuse the Selling Stockholders from its  indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section 8.5(a)_ if the amount of  Taxes as ultimately determined (on audit or otherwise) for the periods covered  by such Tax

 

 

* Returns  exceeds the amount of the Selling Stockholders' payment under this _Section  8.5(c)(iii)_

 

 

* _Straddle  Period Tax Allocation_. The Company will, unless prohibited by  applicable Law, close the taxable period of the Company and the Subsidiaries  as  of the close of business on the Closing Date. If applicable Law does  not permit the Company or a Subsidiary to close its taxable year on the Closing  Date or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a taxable period  which includes the Closing Date (but does not begin or end on that day) (a  " ** _Straddle Period_** "), the Taxes, if any, attributable to a  Straddle Period shall be allocated (i) to the Selling Stockholders for the  period up to and including the close of business on the day immediately  preceding the Closing Date and (ii) to Purchaser for the period subsequent  to  the day immediately preceding the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that such allocation shall in no way affect the obligation of the Selling  Stockholders to be responsible and liable for any and all Taxes (including,  without limitation, arising out of or based on the Section 338(h)(10) Election)  relating to the consummation of the transactions under this Agreement, other  than such Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible as set forth under _Section  8.5(f)_ hereof. Any allocation of income or deductions required to  determine any Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be made by means  of  a closing of the books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of  the  close of the Closing Date, _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or  deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited  to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the  period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in  proportion to the number of days in each such period.

 

 

* _Tax  Audits_.

 

 

* If  notice of any Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the Company or any  of  the Subsidiaries (a " ** _Tax Claim_** ") shall be received by  either party for which the other party may reasonably be expected to be liable  pursuant to _Section 8.5(a)_ , the notified party shall notify such other  party in writing of such Tax Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the  failure of the notified party to give the other party notice as provided herein  shall not relieve such failing party of its obligations under this _Section  8.5_ except to the extent that the other party is actually and materially  prejudiced thereby.

 

 

* Purchaser  shall have the right, at the expense of the Selling Stockholders to the extent  such Tax Claim is subject to indemnification by the Selling Stockholders  pursuant to _Section 8.5(a)_ hereof, to represent the interests of the  Company and the Subsidiaries in any Tax Claim, _provided_ that with respect  to a Tax Claim relating exclusively to taxable periods ending on or before  the  Closing Date, the Stockholder Representative shall represent the interests  of  the Company and shall not settle such claim without the consent of Purchaser,  which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

 

* _Transfer  Taxes_. Purchaser shall be liable for and shall pay (and shall  indemnify and hold harmless the Selling Stockholders against) all sales, use,  stamp, documentary, filing, recording, transfer or similar fees or taxes or  governmental charges as levied by any Governmental Body including any interest  and penalties) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

* _Disputes_. Any  dispute as to any matter covered hereby shall be resolved by an independent  accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Stockholder Representative and the  Purchaser. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be  borne equally by the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Purchaser  on  the other. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not  resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be  filed in the manner which the party responsible for preparing such Tax Return  deems correct.

 

 

* _Time  Limits_. Any claim for indemnity under this _Section 8.5_ may  be made at any time prior to ninety (90) days after the expiration of the  applicable Tax statute of limitations with respect to the relevant taxable  period (including all periods of extension, whether automatic or  permissive).

 

 

* _Exclusivity_. The  indemnification provided for in this _Section 8.5_ shall be the sole remedy  for any claim in respect of Taxes, including any claim arising out of or  relating to a breach of _Section 4.10_. In the event of a  conflict between the provisions of this _Section 8.5_ , on the one hand, and  the provisions of _Sections 8.1_ through _8.4_ , on the other, the  provisions of this _Section 8.5_ shall control.

 

 

1.85 _Indemnity  Escrow_. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deposit with
First  National Bank of Omaha (the " ** _Escrow Agent_** "), as agent to 
Purchaser and the Stockholder Representation (on behalf of the Selling 
Stockholders), in immediately available funds, to the account designated by 
the  Escrow Agent, and amount equal to $5,000,000.00 (the " ** _Indemnity 
Escrow Amount_** "), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and  the
Escrow Agreement, which will be executed at the Closing, by and among 
Purchaser, the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent (the " **
_Escrow Agreement_** "). Any payment the Selling  Stockholders are obligated
to make to any Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant  to this _Article VIII_
shall be paid first, to the extent there are  sufficient funds in the
Indemnity Escrow Account, by release of funds to the  Purchaser Indemnified
Parties from the Indemnity Escrow Account by the Escrow  Agent in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and shall accordingly  reduce the
Indemnity Escrow Amount and, second, to the extent the Indemnity  Escrow
Amount is insufficient (and such claims are not subject to the Cap 
limitation under _Section 8.4(c)_ ) to pay any remaining sums due, then the 
Selling Stockholders shall be required to pay all of such additional sums
due  and owing to the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party by wire transfer
of  immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after the date
of  such  notice. On the first (1st) anniversary  of  the Closing Date,
the Escrow Agent shall release the Indemnity Escrow Amount  (to  the extent
not utilized to pay any Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any 
indemnification claim) to the Stockholder Representative (for distribution 
to  the Selling Stockholders in accordance with their respective _pro rata_
  portion of the Purchase Price), except that the Escrow Agent shall retain
an  amount (up to the total amount then held by the Escrow Agent) equal to
the  amount of claims for indemnification under this _Article VIII_
asserted  prior to such first (1st) anniversary  but  not yet resolved ("
** _Unresolved Claims_** "). The  Indemnity Escrow Amount retained for
Unresolved Claims shall be released by  the  Escrow Agent (to the extent not
utilized to pay Purchaser Indemnified Parties  for any such claims resolved
in favor thereof) upon their resolution in  accordance with this _Article
VIII_ and the terms of the Escrow  Agreement.

 

 

1.86 _Treatment  of Indemnity Payments_. The Selling Stockholders and the
Purchaser  agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this
_Article VIII_   as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all purposes,
including relating  to  income Taxes.

 

 

1.87 _Exclusive  Remedy_. Except for claims for intentional acts of fraud by
any of  the Controlling Owner, the chief financial officer or chief operating
officer  of  the Company, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy available  to the parties hereto for claims arising out of the subject
matter of this  Agreement shall be indemnification in accordance with this
_Article  VIII_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 8.8_   shall
not (i) operate to interfere with or impede the operation under  _Sections
2.7_ , _2.8_ , _9.3_ or this _Article VIII_ for the  resolution of certain
disputes and payment of funds in respect thereof or (ii)  limit the rights of
the parties to seek non-monetary equitable remedies  (including specific
performance or injunctive relief).

 

 

 

**TERMINATION**

 

 

1.88 _Termination  of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated prior to
the  Closing as follows:

* by  mutual written consent of the Stockholder Representative and  Purchaser;

 

 

* by  the Stockholder Representative or Purchaser if there shall be in effect a final  nonappealable Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction  restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the  right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be  available to a party if such Order was primarily due to the failure of such  party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 

 

* by  Purchaser if any Selling Stockholder or the Company shall have breached or  failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or  agreements set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty  of  any Selling Stockholder or the Company shall have become untrue, in either  case  such that the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(a)_ or  _7.1(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach is incapable of being  cured  or, if

 

 

* capable  of being cured, shall not have been cured within ten (10) days following receipt  by the Stockholder Representative of notice of such breach from the Purchaser;  or

 

 

* by  the Stockholder Representative if Purchaser shall have breached or failed to  perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set  forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser  shall  have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in  _Sections 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach  is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been  cured within ten (10) days following receipt by Purchaser of notice of such  breach from the Stockholder Representative.

 

 

1.89 _Procedure  Upon Termination_. In the event of termination and
abandonment by  Purchaser or the Stockholder Representative, or both,
pursuant to _Section  9.1_ , written notice thereof shall forthwith be given
to the other party or  parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the
purchase of the Shares  hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action
by Purchaser, the Company  or the Selling Stockholders; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the  obligations of the parties under _Section 6.9_ ,
_Section 9.3_ and  _Article X_ shall remain in full force and effect.

 

 

1.90 _Effect  of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is validly 
terminated as provided herein, then each of the parties shall be relieved of 
their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of 
such  termination and such termination shall be without liability to
Purchaser, any  Selling Stockholder or the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the  event that this Agreement is terminated by the Stockholder
Representative  pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ (for any reason other than
solely for to the  failure of the Closing to be consummated due to the
failure to satisfy the  conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(f)_ or _Section
7.1(g)_ at such  time as the Stockholder Representative, the other Selling
Stockholders and  the  Company are not in material default of any of their
respective obligations  hereunder) or by Purchaser pursuant to _Sections
9.1(d)_ (for any reason  other than solely for to the failure of the Closing
to be consummated due to  the  failure to satisfy the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.1(f)_ or  _Section 7.1(g)_ at such time as Purchaser is not in
material default of  any of its obligations hereunder), then the Company, if
the Stockholder  Representative is such terminating party, or Purchaser, if
Purchaser is such  terminating party, shall pay to Purchaser (if the
Stockholder Representative  is  such terminating party) or the Company (if
Purchaser is such terminating party)  a termination fee equal to
$2,500,000.00 (as liquidated damages for any such  termination. Any payment
required by the immediately foregoing  sentence shall be made by the
applicable party within five (5) Business Days  after such applicable
termination. The obligations of the parties set  forth in this _Section 9.3_
, _Section 6.9_ and _Article X_ hereof  shall survive any such termination
and shall be enforceable  hereunder.

performance issued  by  any court of competent jurisdiction, and appropriate

No  action taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a waiver  by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation, warranty,  covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party  hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or  be  construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of  any  other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to  exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such  right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise  thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

 

 

1.96 _Governing  Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of Nebraska applicable to contracts
made  and performed in such state.

1.98 _Severability_. If  any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable  of being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms or provisions  of  this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as  the  economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not  affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such  determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable  of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify  this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely  as  possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated  hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent  possible.

 

 

1.99 _Binding  Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and  inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors
and  permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be  deemed
to create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity  not  a
party to this Agreement except as provided below. No assignment of  this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by either 
the Selling Stockholders or Purchaser (by operation of law or otherwise)
without  the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any
attempted  assignment without the required consents shall be void; _provided_
,  _however_ , that Purchaser may assign this Agreement and any or all
rights  or obligations hereunder (including Purchaser's rights to purchase
the Shares  and Purchaser's rights to seek indemnification hereunder) to any
Affiliate of  Purchaser, any Person from which it has borrowed money or any
Person to which  Purchaser or any of its Affiliates proposes to sell all or
substantially all  of  the assets relating to the business, provided,
Purchaser shall remain primarily  liable under this Agreement. Upon any such
permitted assignment, the  references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall
also apply to any such assignee  unless the context otherwise requires.

 

 

1.100 _Non-Recourse_. No  past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member,  partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of Purchaser  shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of Purchaser under  this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the  transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 

1.101 _Counterparts_. This  Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile),  each of which will be deemed to be an
original copy of this Agreement and all  of  which, when taken together,
will be deemed to constitute one and the same  agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been  signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.
