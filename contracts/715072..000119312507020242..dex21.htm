effects provided in Section 1.5.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, immediately after
the Effective Time of the Parent Merger Seller Subsidiary shall be
merged with and into Acquiror  



 

1  Sub (the "Subsidiary Merger" and together with the Parent Merger, the

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

2.1 _Conversion of Shares_. All of the shares of Acquiror issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding after the Effective Time and shall be unaffected by the Parent
Merger. The manner and basis of converting the shares of common stock, no
par value, of Seller (the "Seller Common Stock") upon consummation of the
Mergers shall be as follows:

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any
action on the part of Acquiror, Seller or the holders of Seller Common Stock:



     | (i) | Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.1, each
share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding any treasury shares, shares held by Acquiror or any
of the subsidiaries of Acquiror or Seller (other than in a fiduciary capacity)
and shares held by Dissenting Stockholders (as defined below)) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The "Merger
Consideration" shall mean, depending on the election and proration provisions
of this Section 2.1(a), either (a) cash in the amount of the Price Per Share
(as defined below), without interest (the "Cash Consideration") or (b) a
share of Acquiror Common Stock (as defined below), rounded to the nearest four
decimals, equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Consideration"). As used in
this Agreement, the term "Price Per Share" equals $38.00, the term "Exchange
Ratio" equals 1.2306, and the term "Acquiror Common Stock" means the common
stock, $5.00 per share par value, of the Acquiror.  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

The number of shares of Seller Common Stock to be converted into the right to
receive Cash Consideration shall not be less than 35% of the number of shares
of Seller Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding shares to be cancelled pursuant to clause (x) of this Section
2.1(a)) (the "Minimum Cash Election Number") and shall not be greater
than 40% of the number of shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be cancelled
pursuant to clause (x) of this Section 2.1(a)) (the "Maximum Cash Election
Number"). For purposes of determining both the Minimum Cash Election Number
and Maximum Cash Election Number, Dissenting Stockholders shall be deemed to
have made a Cash Election (as defined below) unless such Dissenting
Stockholders shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect
or otherwise) their right to payment as   

---|---|--- 



 

4  dissenting shareholders under the TCA at or prior to the Effective Time. The
number of shares of Seller Common Stock to be converted into the right
to receive Stock Consideration shall be not less than 60% of the number of
shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (excluding shares to be cancelled pursuant to clause (x) of this Section
2.1(a)) (the "Minimum Stock Election Number") and not greater than 65% of the
number of shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding shares to be cancelled pursuant to clause (x) of
this Section 2.1(a)) (the "Maximum Stock Election Number"). 

---|--- 



     | (iii) | Subject to the proration and election procedures set forth
in this Section 2.1(a), each holder of record of shares of Seller Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any
treasury shares, shares held by Acquiror or any of the subsidiaries of
Acquiror or Seller (other than in a fiduciary capacity) and shares held by
Dissenting Stockholders) will be entitled to elect to receive (a) Cash
Consideration for all such shares (a "Cash Election"), (b) Stock Consideration
for all of such shares (a "Stock Election") or (c) Cash Consideration for 40%
of such shares and Stock Consideration for 60% of such shares (a "Combination
Election"). All such elections shall be made on a form designed for that
purpose prepared by Acquiror and reasonably acceptable to Seller (a "Form of
Election"). The Form of Election will include appropriate stock certificate
transmittal materials which transmittal materials shall specify that the
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
delivery of a certificate or certificates representing shares of Seller
Common Stock to the Exchange Agent (as defined below) and instructions for use
in effecting the surrender to the Exchange Agent of certificates of Seller
Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Holders of record of
shares of Seller Common Stock who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or
in other representative capacities (a "Representative") may submit multiple
Forms of Election, provided that such Representative certifies that each such
Form of Election covers all the shares of Seller Common Stock held by each
such Representative for a particular beneficial owner. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | Acquiror and Seller shall mail the Form of Election
(including the stock certificate transmittal materials) to all persons who are
holders of record of Seller Common Stock on the record date for the Special
Meeting (as defined below), on a date that is not less than 20 Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, and thereafter Acquiror and Seller shall each use
its reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election available to all Persons
who become holders of Seller Common Stock subsequent to such day and no later
than the close of business on the fifth Business Day prior to the Effective
Time. A Form of Election must be received by the Exchange Agent in the
manner described below no later than by the close of business on the Business
Day which is four Business Days immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Election Deadline") in order to be effective. All elections will be
irrevocable.  
---|---|--- 



 

5 by mailing or otherwise delivering to the Exchange Agent (as defined below),
in a manner acceptable to Acquiror, a Form of Election. To be effective, a
Form of Election must be properly completed, signed and submitted to the
Exchange Agent. The Form of Election shall be deemed properly completed only
if accompanied by one or more certificates representing all shares of Seller
Common Stock covered by such Form of Election, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included with the Form of Election. Acquiror will have
the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange
Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been properly completed,
signed and submitted and to disregard immaterial defects in Forms of Election.
The good faith decision of Acquiror (or the Exchange Agent) in such matters
shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Acquiror nor the Exchange Agent will
be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in a Form of
Election. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | A holder of Seller Common Stock who does not submit a Form
of Election which is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election
Deadline shall be deemed to have made a Combination Election. If Acquiror or
the Exchange Agent shall determine that any purported Cash Election or Stock
Election was not properly made, such purported Cash Election or Stock Election
shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and the holder of shares of
Seller Common Stock making such purported Cash Election or Stock Election
shall for purposes hereof be deemed to have made a Combination Election. 
---|---|--- 


     | (vii) |

All shares of Seller Common Stock which are subject to Cash Elections are
referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares." All shares of Seller
Common Stock which are subject to Stock Elections are referred to herein as
"Stock Election Shares." If, after the results of the Forms of Election are
calculated, the number of shares of Seller Common Stock to be converted into
shares of Acquiror Common Stock exceeds the Maximum Stock Election Number,
the Exchange Agent shall, after the Election Deadline but prior to the
Effective Time, determine the number of Stock Election Shares which must be
redesignated as Cash Election Shares in order to reduce the number of such
shares to the Maximum Stock Election Number. All holders who have Stock
Election Shares shall, on a pro rata basis, have such number of their Stock
Election Shares redesignated as Cash Election Shares so that the Maximum
Stock Election Number and the Minimum Cash Election Number are achieved. If,
after the results of the Forms of Election are calculated, the number of
shares of Seller Common Stock to be converted into cash exceeds the Maximum
Cash Election Number, the Exchange Agent, after the Election Deadline but
prior to the Effective Time, shall determine the number of Cash Election
Shares which must be redesignated as Stock Election Shares in order to reduce
the amount of such cash to the Maximum Cash Election Number. All holders who
have Cash Election Shares shall, on a pro rata basis, have such number of
their Cash Election Shares redesignated as Stock Election Shares so that the
Maximum Cash Election Number and the Minimum Stock Election Number are
achieved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no redesignation shall be effected
for a holder who has made a Cash Election but, as a result of such   

---|---|--- 



 

6  redesignation, would receive fewer than 10 shares of Acquiror Common Stock
in exchange for all of such holderÂ’s shares of Seller Common Stock. In
this event, the Cash Election Shares of the remaining holders of shares of
Seller Common Stock shall be redesignated on a pro rata basis to achieve the
Maximum Cash Election Number and the Minimum Stock Election Number. Holders
who make Combination Elections will not be subject to the redesignation
procedures described herein. Dissenting Stockholders who are deemed to have
made Cash Elections shall not be subject to the redesignation procedure
described herein. Acquiror or the Exchange Agent shall make in good faith all
computations contemplated by this Section 2.1(a) and all such computations
shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of Seller Common Stock. 

---|--- 


     | (viii) | It is the intent of the parties that the Parent Merger
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"). In order to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368 of the Code, the Parent Merger must satisfy the Continuity of
Interest requirement set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e). If
after the Exchange Agent completes the redesignation procedures set forth in
Section 2.1(a)(vii) (or if there is no redesignation required by the Exchange
Agent after the Exchange Agent notifies the parties that redesignation is not
required), the Acquiror determines that the value of Acquiror Common Stock
included in the Merger Consideration will not be sufficient to satisfy the
Continuity of Interest requirement, then Acquiror shall increase the Exchange
Ratio and decrease the Price Per Share to the extent Acquiror deems necessary
to meet the Continuity of Interest requirement. The adjustment of the Exchange
Ratio and the Price Per Share by Acquiror under this Section 2.1(a)(viii)
shall be conclusive and binding on the parties to this Agreement. For
purposes of this Section 2.1(a)(viii), the Continuity of Interest requirement
is agreed to be at least 40% continuity. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | After the redesignation procedure, if any, set forth in
Sections 2.1(a)(vii) and (viii), respectively, are completed, all Cash
Election Shares and 40% of the shares of Seller Common Stock which are
subject to Combination Elections shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration, and all Stock Election Shares and 60% of the shares of
Seller Common Stock which are subject to Combination Elections shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. Such
certificates previously evidencing shares of Seller Common Stock shall be
exchanged for (a) certificates evidencing the Stock Consideration or (b) the
Cash Consideration, multiplied in each case by the number of shares
previously evidenced by the cancelled certificate, upon the surrender of such
certificates in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2, without
interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no fractional shares of
Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment
shall be made pursuant to Section 2.1(b). 
---|---|--- 


     | (x) |

Each share of Seller Common Stock held in the treasury of Seller and each
share of Seller Common Stock owned by Acquiror or any subsidiary of Acquiror
or Seller (other than in a fiduciary capacity) immediately prior to the
Effective Time   

---|---|--- 



 

7  shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

---|--- 
(b) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock will be issued as a result of the Mergers. In lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement, cash
adjustments (without interest) will be paid to the holder of Seller Common
Stock in respect of any fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock that
would otherwise be issuable to such holder of Seller Common Stock, and the
amount of such cash adjustment shall be determined by multiplying the fraction
of a share of Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable by the average of the
closing price of one share of Acquiror Common Stock for the 10 trading days
immediately preceding the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing
Date as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and no such holder shall
be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other right of stockholders in
respect of any fractional share.

2.2 _Exchange of Seller Common Stock Certificates_.

(a) Registrar and Transfer Company shall serve as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") in connection with the Parent Merger. Exchange Agent shall
not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration to which any former
holder of Seller Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Parent Merger
until the Exchange Agent receives a properly completed Form of Election
accompanied by the stock certificates representing all shares of Seller
Common Stock covered by such Form of Election, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included with the Form of Election, as provided in this
Section 2.2. After the Effective Time, each certificate that represented
outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed for all corporate purposes (other than the payment of dividends and
other distributions to which the former stockholders of Seller Common Stock
may be entitled) to evidence only the right of the holder thereof to receive
the Merger Consideration in exchange for each such share or as provided in
Section 2.1 of this Agreement.

(b) Any Merger Consideration held by an Exchange Agent that remains
undistributed to the former stockholders of Seller for twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquiror upon demand, and any
former stockholders of Seller who have not theretofore complied with this
Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for payment of their claims
for cash, Acquiror Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Acquiror Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to
Acquiror Common Stock (all without any interest thereon).

(c) None of Acquiror, any subsidiary thereof or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any former holder of Seller Common Stock for cash, shares
of Acquiror Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock delivered to
public officials pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates of Seller
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to shares of Seller
Common Stock represented thereby except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable law. All rights to  



 

8  receive the Merger Consideration issued upon conversion of the shares of
Seller Common Stock pursuant to this Article II shall be deemed to have been
paid or issued, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Seller Common Stock.

(e) Promptly after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent (defined below) (i) cash in an amount equal to the aggregate
Cash Consideration and cash sufficient to pay fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock and (ii) certificates representing shares of Acquiror Common
Stock equal to the aggregate Stock Consideration (such cash and shares of
Acquiror Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect to such Acquiror Common Stock, the "Exchange Fund") for the benefit
of SellerÂ’s stockholders.

(f) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
person other than the person in whose name a stock certificate for shares of
Seller Common Stock (each a "Seller Stock Certificate") so surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such Seller Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes (as defined in Section 3.7(c))
required as a result of such payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Seller Stock Certificate, or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. Acquiror or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of the Seller Common Stock such amounts as Acquiror or
the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by Acquiror or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of the Seller
Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by
Acquiror or the Exchange Agent.

(g) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration or
transfers of shares of the Seller Common Stock. If after the Effective Time,
the Seller Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

(h) In the event any of the Seller Stock Certificate(s) shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Seller Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, the posting by
such person of a bond in such sum as either of them may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Seller Stock Certificate(s), the Exchange
Agent will issue the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares
of Seller Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Seller
Stock Certificate(s).

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash balances in the Exchange Fund in
a demand deposit account or as directed by Acquiror. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Acquiror
upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Acquiror
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration
within ten (10) Business Days following the receipt of each letter of
transmittal.



 

9 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. No outstanding share of Seller Common Stock as to
which the holder has exercised dissenters rights under the TCA and did not
vote for the adoption of this Agreement and the Parent Merger Documents shall
be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration,
and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted
by the TCA. Seller shall give Acquiror prompt notice upon receipt by Seller of
any such written demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of the
Seller Common Stock and of withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments provided pursuant to the TCA (any stockholder duly making such
demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting Stockholder"). Acquiror shall
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands or
notices. Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of Acquiror, make
any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise
negotiate, any such demands. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such
payment at or prior to the Effective Time, such holderÂ’s shares of the Seller
Common Stock shall be automatically converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Agreement, without any interest thereon, as if such holder had made a
Combination Election. If such holder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment after the
Effective Time, each share of the Seller Common Stock of such holder shall be
automatically converted, on a share-by-share basis, into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, as if such holder had
made a Combination Election.

2.4 _Additional Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall consider that any further assignments or
assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, Seller and its proper officers and directors
shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable
power of attorney to execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments
and assurances in law and to do all acts necessary or proper to vest, perfect
or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in
the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement; and the proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
are fully authorized in the name of Seller or otherwise to take any and all
such action.

2.5 _Rights as Stockholders_. Former stockholders of Seller and any other
individuals or entities who or which are entitled to receive Acquiror Common
Stock as a result of the Mergers will be able to vote after the Effective Time
at any meeting of Acquiror stockholders or pursuant to any written consent
procedure the number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which
their shares of Seller Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether they
have exchanged their Seller Stock Certificates. In addition, whenever a
dividend is declared by Acquiror on the Acquiror Common Stock after the
Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends on all shares of
Acquiror Common Stock issuable hereunder, but no stockholder will be entitled
to receive his distribution of such dividends until physical exchange of such
stockholderÂ’s Seller Stock Certificates shall have been effected. Upon
exchange of a stockholderÂ’s Seller Stock Certificates, any such person shall
be entitled to receive from Acquiror an amount equal to all dividends (without
interest thereon less the amount of any taxes, if any, that may have been
withheld, imposed or paid thereon) declared, and for which the payment has
occurred, on the shares represented thereby; provided, however, that former
stockholders of Seller shall not be entitled to receive any dividend on their
Acquiror Common Stock with respect to any period for which Acquiror paid a
dividend prior to the Effective Time.



 

10 2.6 _Stock Transfer Records_. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall
continue to maintain its stock transfer records and to transfer and replace
stock certificates in accordance with its existing policies and past practices
with regard to such transfers and replacements. From and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Seller or
Acquiror of shares of Seller Common Stock which were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

2.7 _Subsidiary Merger_. At the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger, each
share of common stock, no par value per share, of Seller Subsidiary (the
"Seller Subsidiary Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger shall be automatically cancelled
and the certificate or certificates therefor shall be surrendered and
cancelled. There shall be no conversion, exchange or consideration for such
Seller Subsidiary Common Stock. All of the shares of Acquiror Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger
shall remain issued and outstanding after the effective time of the Subsidiary
Merger and shall be unaffected by the Subsidiary Merger.

2.8 _Seller Stock Options and Related Matters_.

(a) As of the Effective Time, all rights with respect to Seller Common Stock
issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted by Seller
under the 2001 Capital Bancorp, Inc. Stock Option Plan (the "Stock Option
Plan"), as well as any shares that are in the process of being purchased
through the payroll deduction provisions of the 2005 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the "Employee Stock Purchase Plan") but have not yet been delivered
(collectively "Outstanding Seller Stock Options," and the Stock Option Plan
and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, collectively, the "Seller Stock
Plans"), which are outstanding at the Effective Time, whether are not such
Seller Stock Options are then exercisable, shall, subject to this Section, be
assumed by Acquiror in accordance with the terms of the particular Seller
Stock Plan under which such Seller Stock Options were issued and the
agreement by which such Seller Stock Options are evidenced, except that from
and after the Effective Time (i) Acquiror and its Compensation Committee shall
be substituted for Seller and the SellerÂ’s Compensation Committee
administering the particular Seller Stock Plan, (ii) each Seller Stock Option
assumed by Acquiror hereunder may be exercised solely for Acquiror Common
Stock, (iii) the number of shares Acquiror Common Stock subject to such
Seller Stock Option shall be equal to the number of shares Seller Common Stock
subject to such Seller Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and (iv) the per share exercise price under
each such Seller Stock Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share
exercise price under each such Seller Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio and
rounding up to the nearest cent. The parties further agree that Seller
shall be permitted, following the date of this Agreement, to amend or
terminate the Seller Stock Plans and amend any Nonqualified Stock Option
Agreement or similar agreement evidencing the grant or award of equity
compensation of a director of Seller or Seller Subsidiary, as contemplated in
Section 5.2(vi) herein.

(b) At all times after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall reserve
for issuance such number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock as shall be
necessary to permit the exercise of any converted or substitute Seller Stock
Options. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, if Acquiror has not
already done so, and to the extent Seller shall have a registration statement
in  



 

11  effect or an obligation to file a registration statement, Acquiror shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or appropriate
form), with respect to the Acquiror shares subject to the assumed Seller
Stock Options and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status
of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such
assumed Seller Stock Options remain outstanding.

(c) The number of Acquiror shares subject to the converted or substituted
Seller Stock Options and the exercise price therefore shall, from and after
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, be subject to appropriate
adjustment in the event of the occurrence of any transaction described in
Section 5.17 hereof if the record date with respect to such transaction is on
or after the date of this Agreement or the Effective Time, respectively.

(d) Each Seller Stock Option which is an incentive stock option as defined in
Section 422 of the Code shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the
Code, and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, so as to continue as an
incentive stock option under Section 424(a) of the Code, and so as not to
constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option within the
meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. Acquiror and Seller agree to take all
steps necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8(d).

financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability
for assets, (c) access to SellerÂ’s material assets is permitted only in
accordance with managementÂ’s general or specific authorization, and (d) the

3.20 _Risk Management Instruments_. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,
option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other similar risk

26  into (i) to the Knowledge of Seller, in accordance with all applicable laws,
rules, regulations and regulatory policies and (ii) with counterparties

such Risk Management Instrument (except as limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
creditorsÂ’ rights generally, and except that the availability of equitable
remedies (including specific performance) is within the discretion of the
appropriate court), and is in full force and effect. Seller and the Seller
Subsidiary have duly performed in all respects all of their material
obligations under Risk Management Instruments to the extent such obligations
to perform have accrued; and there are no material breaches, violations or
defaults, or allegations or assertions of any material breaches, violations or
defaults, by any party thereunder.

perfected in all material respects, and no collateral has been released from
the lien granted to Seller and the Seller Subsidiary with respect to any such
loans unless approved by Seller and the Seller Subsidiary and documented in
their files. Neither the terms of such loans nor any of the loan
documentation nor the manner in which such loans have been originated,
administered and serviced nor SellerÂ’s procedures and practices of approving

obligations under such loans as to which compliance is required as of

laws from time to time in effect relating to or affecting the enforcement of
the rights of creditors of FDIC-insured institutions or the enforcement of
creditorsÂ’ rights generally; and (ii) general principles of equity (whether
applied in a court of law or in equity). All such loans will continue in full
force and effect immediately after the Effective Time, other than any loans
that are paid or otherwise satisfied in full after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective  



 

27  Time. For purposes of this Section 3.23, the term "loans" includes, without
limitation, the documents relating in any way to such loans, including,
without limitation, notes, mortgages, security instruments and guaranties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made as to the

---|---|--- 

5.3 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Neither Seller nor the Seller Subsidiary shall, nor shall Seller or the
Seller Subsidiary authorize or permit any of its directors, officers or
employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other representative of Seller or the Seller Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, solicit or hold discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, any person, entity or group (other than Acquiror or Acquiror
Sub) concerning any Acquisition Transaction (as defined below); provided,
however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Seller (on
behalf of itself and the Seller Subsidiary) or the Board of Directors of
Seller from (i) providing information in response to a request therefor by a
person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written proposal to engage in
an Acquisition Transaction (an "Acquisition Proposal") if the Board of
Directors of Seller receives from the person so requesting such information an
executed confidentiality agreement on customary terms and conditions; (ii)
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person who has made an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal; (iii) failing to
recommend or withdrawing its recommendation of this Agreement to its
stockholders and/or failing to hold the Special Meeting (as defined in
Section 5.8) to consider this Agreement; or (iv) recommending such an
Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of Seller, if and only to the extent
that, in each such  



 

39  case referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, (A) SellerÂ’s
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that such action would be required in order for its directors
to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable law and (B)
SellerÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial
and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal
and would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to SellerÂ’s
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Mergers. An Acquisition
Proposal which is received and considered by Seller in compliance with this
Section 5.3 and which meets the requirements set forth in clauses (A) and (B)
of the preceding sentence is herein referred to as a "Superior Proposal".
Seller will communicate to Acquiror in writing (the "Notice") as promptly as
practicable (and in no event more than 48 hours after receipt) the terms of
any proposal which it may receive in respect of any Acquisition Transaction
(including amendments thereto) and shall provide Acquiror with copies of (x)
all such written inquiries or proposals and (y) an accurate and complete
written synopsis of all such oral inquiries or proposals. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" means any offer or proposal by a person
or entity other than Acquiror or Acquiror Sub for (i) a merger, tender offer,
recapitalization or consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving the
Seller or the Seller Subsidiary; (ii) a purchase, lease or other acquisition
or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Seller or
the Seller Subsidiary; (iii) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way
of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of beneficial ownership
(the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the
meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of securities representing 20% or more of the voting
power of the Seller; or (iv) any substantially similar transaction.

(b) During the 10 days immediately following the AcquirorÂ’s receipt of the
Notice, Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) shall be entitled to
match or better the terms of the Superior Proposal described in the Notice. If
Acquiror advises Seller in writing during such 10 day period that it has
elected to match or better the terms of the Superior Proposal, (i) Seller,
Seller Subsidiary, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub within two days of such election
by Acquiror, shall amend this Agreement and the Merger Documents to reflect
the matched or bettered terms of the Superior Proposal as proposed by
Acquiror and (ii) Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Subsidiary) shall not
terminate this Agreement, and Seller promptly shall notify the person that
made or conveyed the Superior Proposal that Acquiror has matched or bettered
the Superior Proposal and this Agreement has been amended to reflect the
matched or bettered terms. From and after the date on which Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub execute an amendment which matches or betters the
Superior Proposal, Seller and the Seller Subsidiary shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated, and cause its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other
representatives to, immediately cease and caused to be terminated, all
discussions and negotiations regarding the Superior Proposal that has been
matched or bettered by Acquiror with any person other than Acquiror. A person
that has made a Superior Proposal that has been matched or bettered by
Acquiror may make further Acquisition Proposals. During the period commencing
on the date that Seller determines that the Acquisition Proposal meets the
requirements set forth in clauses (A) and (B) above and ending on
the eleventh day after AcquirorÂ’s receipt of the Notice, Seller and the
Seller Subsidiary shall not terminate this Agreement unless Seller receives
written notice from Acquiror that it does not  



 

40  intend to exercise its right to match or better the Superior Proposal. If
Acquiror does not notify Seller of its election by the eleventh day
after AcquirorÂ’s receipt of the Notice, Seller may terminate this Agreement
and proceed with the Superior Proposal as provided in this Agreement.

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3 and Section 5.8, neither
the Board of Directors of Seller nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw,
modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a
manner adverse to Acquiror, the approval of the Agreement and the Parent
Merger Documents or the Seller Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.8) or
take any action or make any statement in connection with the Special
Meeting inconsistent with such approval or the Seller Recommendation
(collectively, a "Change in the Seller Recommendation"); (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) cause Seller to enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, a
"Seller Acquisition Agreement") related to any Acquisition Transaction. For
purposes of this Agreement, a Change in the Seller Recommendation shall
include any approval or recommendation (or public proposal to approve or
recommend), by SellerÂ’s Board of an Acquisition Proposal, or any failure by
SellerÂ’s Board to recommend against an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Seller, to the extent that it
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to terminate this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, may
terminate this Agreement in order to concurrently enter into a Seller
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, but only at a
time that is after the compliance by Seller with the terms of Sections
5.3(a), 5.3(b) and 7.4.

(d) Upon the execution of this Agreement, Seller and the Seller Subsidiary
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and cause its officers,
directors and employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants and other representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated, all discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken
place prior to the date hereof with any persons with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and, upon request by Acquiror, shall request the return
and destruction of all confidential information provided to any such person.

5.4 _Negative Covenants of Acquiror_. Except as expressly provided in
this Agreement, or as set forth in _Acquiror Disclosure Schedule 5.4_ ,
during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each
of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub shall not (i) other than in connection with this
Agreement, and except as would not have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub to perform their obligations hereunder,
fail to conduct its business in the ordinary and usual course consistent with
past practices and prudent banking practice, or fail to maintain and preserve
intact its business organization, properties, leases, employees and
advantageous business relationships and retain the services of its officers
and key employees; (ii) knowingly take any action which would be reasonably
expected to adversely affect or delay the ability of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub
to perform their respective covenants and agreements on a timely basis under
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (iii) knowingly take any action or knowingly fail to take any
action that would reasonably be expected to result in any of its
representations and warranties contained in Article IV of this Agreement not
being true and correct in any material respect at the Effective Time; (iv)
knowingly take any action which would be reasonably  



 

41  expected to adversely affect or delay the ability of the Acquiror or
Acquiror Sub to obtain any necessary approvals, consents or waivers of any
Governmental Entity required for the transactions contemplated hereby or
which would reasonably be expected to result in any such approvals, consents
or waivers containing any condition or restriction that would materially
impair the value of the transaction to Acquiror; or (v) agree to do any of
the foregoing.

5.5 _Current Information_. During the period from the date hereof to
the Effective Time, Seller and Seller Subsidiary will cause one or more of
its designated representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis
with representatives of Acquiror regarding its business, operations, assets
and financial condition and matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Within 30 days after the end of each fiscal
quarter, Seller shall provide Acquiror with a copy of the FDIC Call Report
filed with the FDIC.

5.6 _Access to Properties and Records; Confidentiality_.

(a) Seller and Seller Subsidiary shall permit Acquiror and its representatives
reasonable access to their properties and shall disclose and make available to
Acquiror all books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties,
operations, obligations and liabilities of Seller and the Seller Subsidiary,
including, but not limited to, all books of account (including the general
ledger), tax records, minute books of directorsÂ’ and stockholdersÂ’ meetings,
organizational documents, bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings
with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees,
and any other business activities in which Acquiror may have an interest.
Neither Seller nor the Seller Subsidiary shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights of any customer or would contravene any law, rule,
regulation, order or judgment. Seller and the Seller Subsidiary will use
their best efforts to obtain waivers of any such restriction and in any event
make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in
which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Seller and the Seller
Subsidiary shall make their respective executive officers available to confer
with Acquiror and its representatives, provided that such access shall be
reasonably related to the transactions contemplated hereby and not unduly
interfere with normal operations.

(b) All information furnished previously by Acquiror, Acquiror Sub, Seller or
Seller Subsidiary, or hereafter furnished prior to the Effective Time, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant
hereto shall be treated as the sole property of the party furnishing the
information until consummation of the Mergers and, if such Mergers shall not
occur, the party receiving the information shall, at the request of the party
which furnished such information, either return to the party which furnished
such information or destroy all documents or other materials containing,
reflecting or referring to such information; shall use its best efforts to
keep confidential all such information; shall use such information only for
the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and shall not directly or indirectly use such information for any
competitive or commercial purposes. The obligations of Acquiror, Acquiror Sub,
Seller and the Seller Subsidiary to keep such information confidential shall
continue for one year from the date the proposed Mergers are abandoned but
shall not apply to (i) any information which (A) was already in the possession
of the party receiving the information prior to the disclosure thereof to it
by the party furnishing the information; (B) was then generally known to the
public; (C) became known to the public  



 

42  through no fault of the party receiving the information; or (D) was
disclosed to the party receiving the information by a third-party not known by
the receiving party to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality; or (ii)
disclosures pursuant to a legal requirement or in accordance with an order of
a court of competent jurisdiction.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, each party is
permitted to disclose the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions
contemplated hereby at any time on or after the earliest to occur of (i) the
date of public announcement of discussions relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) the date of public announcement of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) the date of execution of this
Agreement (it being understood by the parties that a "public announcement"
shall mean a public announcement permitted by this Agreement (or otherwise
permitted by agreement of the parties) as distinguished from a third-party
announcement or a leak). This Agreement shall not be construed to limit in any
way either partyÂ’s ability to consult any tax advisor regarding the tax
treatment or tax structure of the Mergers. These provisions are meant to be
interpreted so as to prevent the Mergers from being treated as offered under
"conditions of confidentiality" within the meaning of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder.

5.7 _Regulatory Matters_.

(a) The parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use their best
efforts to prepare all necessary documentation (including the Registration
Statement), to effect all necessary filings and to obtain all necessary
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable. The parties shall each
have the right to review in advance all information relating to the other, as
the case may be, and any of their respective subsidiaries, which appears in
any filing made with, or written material submitted to, any third party or
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) Each of the parties will furnish each other with all information
concerning themselves, their subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in
connection with any statement or application made by or on behalf of them, or
any of their respective subsidiaries, to any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions, applications or filings
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Each of the parties will promptly furnish each other with copies of
written communications received by them or any of their respective
subsidiaries from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions, applications or filings contemplated by this Agreement.

5.8 _Approval of Stockholders_. Seller shall, subject to the provisions
of Section 5.3 and this Section 5.8, (i) take all steps (including
participation in the preparation of the Registration Statement in accordance
with all applicable requirements and having the Registration Statement cleared
by the Commission and mailed to its stockholders) necessary to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (including any
adjournments, the "Special Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable for the
purposes of  



 

43  securing the approval of such stockholders of this Agreement and the Parent
Merger Documents, (ii) recommend to its stockholders the approval of
this Agreement and the Parent Merger Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (the "Seller Recommendation"), and (iii) use
its best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, such approval;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors of Seller may fail to hold
such Special Meeting, fail to make such recommendation, or withdraw, modify or
change any such recommendation, if such Board of Directors, after having
consulted with and considered the advice of outside counsel, has determined
in good faith that the holding of such Special Meeting, the making of such
recommendation or the failure to withdraw, modify or change such
recommendation, either as a result of an Acquisition Proposal that has not
been withdrawn or otherwise, would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties
of such directors under applicable law. The parties will reasonably cooperate
in the preparation of the Registration Statement. Promptly following approval
of this Agreement and the Parent Merger Documents by the stockholders of
Seller, Seller, as the sole stockholder of Seller Subsidiary, will approve and
consent to this Agreement and the Subsidiary Merger Documents in such
capacity, whether at a meeting or by written consent.

5.9 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all reasonable action and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to satisfy the conditions to Closing contained herein and to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Merger Documents.

5.10  _Disclosure Supplements_. From time to time prior to the Effective
Time, each party will supplement or amend its respective Disclosure Schedules
delivered pursuant hereto with respect to any matter hereafter arising which,
if existing, occurring or known as of the date hereof, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Schedules or which is necessary
to correct any information in such Schedules which has been rendered
inaccurate thereby; provided, however, that the inclusion of any information
in any such amendment or supplement not included in the original Disclosure
Schedules shall not limit or impair any right which a party may have to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) due to failure to satisfy
the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a), as the case may
be.

5.11 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto
shall approve in advance the substance, and cooperate with each other in the
development and distribution, of all news releases and other public
disclosures with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except as may be otherwise required by law or regulation
and as to which the parties releasing such information have used their
reasonable efforts to discuss with the other parties in advance.

5.12 _Failure to Fulfill Conditions_. In the event that either of the parties
hereto determines that a condition to its respective obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or
prior to September 30, 2007 and that it will not waive that condition, it will
promptly notify the other party. Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror
Sub) and Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Subsidiary) will promptly
inform the other of any facts applicable to them, or their respective
directors or officers, that would be likely  



 

44  to prevent or materially delay unqualified approval of the Mergers by any
Governmental Entity or which would otherwise prevent or materially delay
completion of such Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

5.13 _Certain Post-Merger Agreements_.

The parties hereto agree to the following arrangements following the Effective
Time:

(a) _Employee Benefit Plans_.



     | (1) | Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.13, all
employees of Seller or the Seller Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time who become employed by Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or any
subsidiary or affiliate thereof (as the case may be, "Employer") immediately
following the Effective Time ("Transferred Employees") will be covered by the
Employer employee benefit plans on substantially the same basis as other
employees of Employer performing services primarily on behalf of Employer in a
comparable position. Following the Effective Time, Acquiror will provide
continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code and 601 of ERISA to all
qualified beneficiaries who were entitled to such coverage under SellerÂ’s or
Seller SubsidiaryÂ’s group health plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employer may determine to continue any of the
Seller Plans for Transferred Employees in lieu of offering participation in
the Employer benefit plans providing similar benefits (e.g., medical and
hospitalization benefits). Alternatively, after the Effective Time, Employer
may elect to terminate or amend any of the Seller Plans or to merge any such
benefit plans with the Employer benefit plans. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Section 5.13 and/or as otherwise prohibited by
law, Transferred EmployeesÂ’ service with Seller or the Seller Subsidiary
shall be recognized as service with the Employer for purposes of eligibility
to participate and vesting under the Employer benefit plans, policies or
arrangements for which they may be eligible on or after the Effective Time
(including but not limited to, vacation, sick and other leave policies),
subject to applicable break-in-service rules, and provided that such service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefit. Acquiror and Acquiror Sub agree
that, to the extent waived, satisfied or inapplicable to any Transferred
Employee under the terms of any group health, group term life insurance or
long-term disability plan maintained by Seller or the Seller Subsidiary at
the Effective Time, any preexisting condition or similar limitation or
exclusion contained in an EmployerÂ’s group health, long-term disability or
group term life insurance plans shall not apply to Transferred Employees or
their covered dependents who are covered under similar plans maintained by
Seller or the Seller Subsidiary at the Effective Time and who then change
coverage to the EmployerÂ’s group health, group term life insurance or long-
term disability plan at the time such Transferred Employees are first given
the option to enroll.

45 and shall cause the appropriate Employer to assume and honor in accordance
with their terms all employment agreements existing immediately prior to the
Effective Time which are between Seller or the Seller Subsidiary and any
officer which have been disclosed in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.13(a)_ , in
the form in effect as of the date hereof.  
---|---|--- 



     | (3) | Following the Effective Time, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub may
determine to continue, amend or terminate any deferred compensation plan,
policy, program or arrangement listed on  _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(a)_
provided that any amendment, termination or continuance does not impair the
benefits due thereunder as of the date hereof and that any such amendment,
termination or continuance is permitted under such plans, policies, programs
or arrangements or otherwise required by applicable law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (4) | Prior to the Closing Date, SellerÂ’s board of directors shall
adopt corporate resolutions as necessary to (i) terminate any Qualified Seller
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code
("Seller 401(k) Plan") effective as of the date preceding the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, (ii) fully vest the account balances of the
participants and beneficiaries in the Seller 401(k) Plan as of the
termination date, (iii) reserve the power to amend the Seller 401(k) Plan
after the date of termination to the extent reasonably necessary to comply
with applicable law or to facilitate the termination of the Seller 401(k)
Plan, and (iv) provide for the distribution of benefits from the Seller 401(k)
plan in accordance with its terms and as permitted under applicable law.
Following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the account balances
under the Seller 401(k) Plan to be distributed in accordance with the terms
of such plan and applicable law, and take such other actions, as it deems
necessary to finalize the termination of the Seller 401(k) Plan. 
---|---|--- 


     | (5) |

As of the date hereof, Seller shall amend its Employee Stock Purchase Plan to
prohibit the declaration or occurrence of any additional offering periods or
offering dates thereunder, except that such amendment shall not affect any
such period or date declared on or before the date hereof, and to prohibit the
execution of any additional subscription agreements in connection therewith.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall terminate the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan; provided, however, that such termination shall not
preclude the acquisition of shares of Seller Common Stock with respect to any
offering period or offering date declared or fixed under the terms of the
plan prior to the date hereof or the continuation of payroll deductions with
respect to a subscription agreement entered into in connection therewith.
After the Effective Time, the right to acquire shares of Seller Common Stock
shall be converted to the right to acquire shares of Acquiror Common Stock in
an amount equal to the number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to the
terms of   

---|---|--- 



 

46  each acquisition agreement then in effect multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
and at an acquisition price determined as the quotient of the acquisition
price determined in accordance with such plan divided by the Exchange Ratio. 

---|--- 



     | (6) | No provision in this Agreement shall amend or modify or be
deemed to modify or amend any Seller Plan or any similar plan, policy,
arrangement or agreement maintained by Acquiror. Nothing contained herein
shall be deemed a guarantee of employment for any Transferred Employee or to
restrict the right of Acquiror, Acquiror subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee or a guarantee of any
type or amount of compensation or benefits. 
---|---|--- 

(b) _Indemnification_. Acquiror shall indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of Seller determined as of the
Effective Time and Seller Subsidiary determined as of the effective time of
the Subsidiary Merger, all of whom are identified on Seller Disclosure
_Schedule 5.13(b)_ , and their heirs, personal representatives and estates
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against, and shall promptly upon
request advance or reimburse, any and all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, interest, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement (collectively, "Costs") as
they are incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative or
investigative ("Proceeding"), whether or not the Indemnified Party is a party
to such Proceeding, based upon or arising from the Indemnified PartyÂ’s
capacity as an officer or director of Seller and/or the Seller Subsidiary,
whether threatened, asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time (collectively, "Claims"), to the same extent as the Indemnified Parties
would have been indemnified under the Articles of Incorporation and/or Bylaws
of Acquiror as such documents were in effect on the date of this Agreement as
if the Indemnified Parties were officers or directors of Acquiror at all
relevant times. This indemnity shall be provided for two years following the
Effective Time; or if there shall be any proceeding pending or threatened on
the second anniversary of the Effective Time, such indemnity shall continue in
full force and effect until such pending or threatened Proceeding is finally
resolved.

The rights to indemnification granted by this Section 5.13(b) are subject to
the following limitations: (i) the total aggregate indemnification provided
by Acquiror pursuant to this Section 5.13(b) shall not exceed, as to all
Indemnified Parties as a group, a sum equal to the Indemnification Cap, and
Acquiror shall have no responsibility to the Indemnified Parties for the
manner in which such sum is allocated among that group; (ii) a director or
officer who would otherwise be a member of the Indemnified Parties under this
_Section 5.13(b)_ shall not be entitled to the benefits hereof unless such
director or officer has executed a Joinder Agreement in the form of _Schedule
5.13(b)_ hereto; and (iii) amounts otherwise required to be paid by Acquiror
to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 5.13(b) shall be reduced
by any amounts that such Indemnified Parties recover from any third party. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Indemnification Cap" shall mean an amount equal
to the sum of (i) $5,000,000 and (ii) the policy limits of the insurance
coverage obtained by Acquiror in accordance with Section 5.13(c).



 

47 Acquiror agrees that the Indemnification Cap limit set forth in this Section
5.13(b) shall not apply to any damages, liabilities, judgments and claims
(and related expenses, including, without limitation, attorneysÂ’ fees and
amounts paid in settlement) insofar as they arise out of or are based upon the
matters for which indemnification is provided in Section 5.21 hereof.

(c) _Insurance_. Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or
to cause the Acquiror Sub to obtain, for a period of two years after the
Effective Time policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance
covering the persons listed on _Seller Disclosure Schedule 5.13(b)_ at no cost
to the beneficiaries thereof with respect to the acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time with substantially the same coverage and
containing substantially similar provisions and conditions as existing
policies; provided, however, that neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub shall be
required to pay an aggregate premium for such insurance coverage in excess of
200% of the amount for such coverage set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule
3.14_ but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount.

(d) _Subsequent Events_. In the event that Acquiror or Acquiror Sub or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any entity, then, and in each such case,
the surviving or purchasing entity and the successors and assigns of such
entity shall assume the obligations set forth in Sections 5.13(b) and (c),
which obligations are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and the
persons listed on Seller Disclosure _Schedule 5.13(c)_ , respectively, and
shall survive the Closing of this Agreement. 

5.14 _Takeover Laws; No Rights Triggered_. If any Takeover Law may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each
of Seller, Seller Subsidiary, Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and the members of
their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
any Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.15 _Preparation of Registration Statement_. The parties hereto shall jointly
prepare as promptly as practicable a proxy statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of Seller who are to vote upon this Agreement and the Parent
Merger Documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and
to be part of the Registration Statement to be filed by Acquiror with the
Commission pursuant to the 1933 Act with respect to the shares to be issued
in connection with the Mergers. When the Registration Statement or any post-
effective amendment thereto shall become effective, and at all times
subsequent to such effectiveness, up to and including the time of the last
stockholder meeting with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, such
Registration Statement and all amendments or supplements thereto, with respect
to all information set forth therein furnished or to be furnished by Acquiror
and Acquiror Sub relating to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and by Seller and
Seller Subsidiary relating to Seller and the Seller Subsidiary, (i) will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the 1933 Act and
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
thereunder and (ii) will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be  



 

48  stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading. Acquiror will advise Seller promptly after it receives notice
thereof of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, of the issuance of any
stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of the Acquiror Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the amendment or supplement
of the Registration Statement or for additional information. 

5.16 _Affiliates_. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall deliver to
Acquiror a letter identifying all persons whom it believes to be "affiliates"
of Seller for purposes of Rule 145(c) or Rule 144 (as applicable) under the
1933 Act ("Affiliates"). Seller shall use its best efforts to cause each
person so identified to deliver to Acquiror prior to the Effective Time a
written agreement in substantially the form of _Schedule 5.16_ hereto
providing, among other things, that such person will not dispose of Acquiror
Common Stock received in the Parent Merger except in compliance with the
1933 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

5.17 _Adjustment for Changes in Outstanding Shares_. In the event that prior
to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall
have been increased, decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities by reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or other like changes in the
AcquirorÂ’s capitalization, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment
shall be made in the number and kinds of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be
thereafter delivered in connection with the Parent Merger.

5.18 _Adoption of Accounting Policies_. As soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Closing set forth in Article
VI of this Agreement and at such time as consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement seems reasonably assured and in any event prior
to the Effective Time (unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Article VII hereof), Seller and the Seller Subsidiary shall, and shall cause
Capital Bancorp Trust to, take any and all necessary or appropriate actions to
adopt all Acquiror accounting procedures and policies (including, without
limitation, those policies pertaining to charged-off and non-accrual assets);
provided, however, that no such action taken by Seller or the Seller
Subsidiary at the request of Acquiror pursuant to this section shall be deemed
to be, or be deemed to cause, a breach of any representation or warranty made
by Seller or the Seller Subsidiary herein.

5.19 _Covenant to Close_. At such time as is deemed appropriate by the
parties hereto or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, and upon
satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions to Closing of the Mergers,
the parties agree to take such actions as are reasonably necessary or
appropriate to effect the Closing and the Mergers.

5.20 _Certain Agreements_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof
(but no later than ten days of the date of this Agreement), Seller and Seller
Subsidiary shall have each director of Seller and Seller Subsidiary who is not
an employee of Seller or Seller Subsidiary, respectively, execute a Lock-Up
and Non-Competition Agreement in substantially the form of _Schedule 5.20-A_
hereto and have each executive officer of Seller and Seller Subsidiary who is
also a director of Seller or Seller Subsidiary, respectively, execute a Lock-
Up Agreement in substantially the form of _Schedule 5.20-B_ hereto. On the
Closing Date, Seller shall cause R.  



 

49  Rick Hart to execute an employment agreement in substantially the form of
_Schedule 5.20-C_ hereto (the "Hart Employment Agreement") and a termination
and release agreement in substantially the form of _Schedule 5.20-D_ hereto
(the "Hart Termination Agreement"). On the Closing Date, Seller shall cause
John W. Gregory, Jr. to execute an employment agreement in substantially the
form of _Schedule 5.20-E_ hereto (such employment agreement together with the
Hart Employment Agreement are referred to herein collectively as the
"Employment Agreements") and a termination and release agreement in
substantially the form of _Schedule 5.20-F_ hereto (such termination and
release agreement together with the Hart Termination Agreement are referred to
herein collectively as the "Termination Agreements"). 

5.21 _Hold Harmless_. Acquiror will indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the
Seller Subsidiary, each of the directors and officers and each person, if
any, who controls Seller or the Seller Subsidiary within the meaning of the
1933 Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint, several
and solidary, to which they or any of them may become subject, under the 1933
Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and will pay or promptly reimburse such person for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such person in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim; provided, however, that
Acquiror shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
loss, claim, damage or liability (or actions in respect thereof) arises out of
or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement or any such amendment
or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished
to Acquiror by Seller or the Seller Subsidiary for use therein. Promptly after
receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any
action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against Acquiror under this Section 5.21, notify Acquiror in writing of
the commencement thereof. In case any such action shall be brought against any
indemnified party and it shall notify Acquiror of the commencement thereof,
Acquiror shall be entitled to participate therein; and to the extent that it
shall wish to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such
indemnified party, and, after notice from Acquiror to such indemnified party
of its election to so assume the defense thereof, Acquiror shall not be liable
to such indemnified party under this Section 5.21 for any legal expenses of
other counsel or of any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party.

5.22 _Seller Indebtedness_. Acquiror will execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at or
prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures and other
instruments required for the due assumption of SellerÂ’s (i) outstanding
floating rate Junior Subordinated Debentures issued by Seller pursuant to the
Indenture and (ii) obligations under the related Guarantee Agreement dated
June 16, 2005.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Seller (on behalf of
itself and Seller Subsidiary) terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(i), then Acquiror, at its option, upon written notice to Seller within 15
days of its receipt of SellerÂ’s notice of termination pursuant to Section
7.1(i), may adjust the Exchange Ratio to be equal to the lesser of (i) a
number (rounded to four decimals) equal to a quotient, the numerator of which
is the product of $26.25 multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect)
and the denominator of which is the Average Closing Price, and (ii) a number
(rounded to four decimals) equal to a quotient, the numerator of which is the
Index Ratio multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and
the denominator of which is the Acquiror Ratio. If Acquiror makes an election
contemplated by the preceding sentence, within such 15 day period, it shall
give prompt written notice to Seller of such election and the revised Exchange
Ratio, whereupon SellerÂ’s notice of termination pursuant to Section 7.1(i)
shall be deemed withdrawn and of no force and effect from and after the date
of AcquirorÂ’s notice pursuant to this paragraph and this Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio
shall have been so modified), and any references in this Agreement "Exchange
Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as adjusted
pursuant to this Section 7.1(i).

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Acquiror or Seller as provided above, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void (other than Sections 5.6(b), this Section 7.2, Section 7.4 and
Article VIII hereof, which shall remain in full force and effect), and there
shall be no further liability on the part of the parties or their respective
officers or directors except for the liability of the parties under Sections
5.6(b), 7.4 and 8.1 hereof and except for liability for any willful breach of
any covenant, undertaking, representation or warranty in this Agreement
giving rise to such termination.



 

55 7.3 _Amendment, Extension and Waiver_. Subject to applicable law, at any time
prior to the consummation of the Parent Merger, whether before or after
approval thereof by the stockholders of Seller, the parties may (a) amend this
Agreement and the Merger Documents; (b) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto; (c) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (d) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein (other than required
stockholder and regulatory approval); provided, however, that after any
approval of the Parent Merger by the stockholders of Seller, there may not be,
without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment or waiver of
this Agreement or the Parent Merger Documents which (i) modifies either the
amount or the form of the Merger Consideration to be delivered to stockholders
of Seller (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding adjustments in the
Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(viii) and Section 7.1 of this
Agreement), or (ii) is reasonably likely to materially delay or jeopardize
receipt of any required regulatory approvals or materially impair or prevent
the satisfaction of any other condition to the obligations of Acquiror,
Acquiror Sub, Seller or Seller Subsidiary set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and
6.3 hereof or may materially delay the Effective Time. This Agreement and the
Merger Documents may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party and which has been
authorized by or under the direction of its Board of Directors; but such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

7.4 _Termination Fees_.

(a) In the event that (A) a Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event (as
defined in subsection (c)) shall occur after the date of this Agreement
and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Acquiror or Seller
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) or by Acquiror pursuant to Section 7.1(d) as a
result of a willful breach by Seller or Seller Subsidiary and (B) prior to the
date that is 12 months after the date of such termination Seller consummates
an Acquisition Proposal, then Seller shall, on the date such Acquisition
Proposal is consummated, pay Acquiror a fee equal to $5,000,000 by wire
transfer of same-day funds. 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror pursuant to
Section 7.1(e) or by Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(g), then concurrently
with such termination, Seller shall pay to Acquiror a fee equal to $5,000,000
by wire transfer of same-day funds, and such termination shall not be deemed
effective hereunder until receipt by Acquiror of such fee. For the avoidance
of doubt, if Seller fails to hold the Special Meeting, fails to make the
Seller Recommendation, or withdraws, modifies or changes the Seller
Recommendation either as a result of an Acquisition Proposal that has not
been withdrawn or otherwise, and this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror
pursuant to Section 7.1(e) or by Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(g), then
Seller shall pay the $5,000,000 fee as provided in this Section 7.4(b). In no
event shall Seller be required to pay a $5,000,000 fee under both this
Section 7.4(b) and Section 7.4(a).

(c) For purposes of this Section 7.4, a "Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal
Event" shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the event giving rise to the
right to terminate this  



 

56  Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the senior
management or board of directors of Seller or has been made directly to
its stockholders generally or any person reasonably qualified to consummate
an Acquisition Proposal shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal, and such Acquisition
Proposal or public announcement shall not have been irrevocably withdrawn not
less than five Business Days prior to the Special Meeting with respect to a
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(ii) or the date of termination with
respect to a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d). Seller acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 7.4 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, Acquiror would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
Seller fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 7.4 and,
in order to obtain such payment, Acquiror commences a suit which results in a
judgment against Seller for the fee set forth in this Section 7.4, Seller
shall pay to Acquiror its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.

ARTICLE III

CONVERSION OF SHARES

3.1 CONVERSION OF SHARES. All of the shares of Acquiror issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding after the Effective Time and shall be unaffected by the Merger.
The manner and basis of converting the Seller Common Stock upon consummation
of the Merger shall be as follows:

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Acquiror, Seller or the holders of Seller Common Stock:



 

Exhibit A Â– Page 2 share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding any treasury shares, shares held by Acquiror or any
of the subsidiaries of Acquiror or Seller (other than in a fiduciary capacity)
and shares held by Dissenting Stockholders (as defined below)) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The "Merger
Consideration" shall mean, depending on the election and proration provisions
of this Section 3.1(a), either (a) cash in the amount of the Price Per Share
(as defined below), without interest (the "Cash Consideration") or (b) a
share of Acquiror Common Stock (as defined below), rounded to the nearest four
decimals, equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Consideration"). As used
herein, the term "Price Per Share" equals $38.00, the term "Exchange Ratio"
equals 1.2306 and the term "Acquiror Common Stock" means the common stock,
$5.00 per share par value, of the Acquiror.  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | The number of shares of Seller Common Stock to be converted
into the right to receive Cash Consideration shall not be less than 35% of the
number of shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding shares to be cancelled pursuant to clause (x) of
this Section 3.1(a)) (the "Minimum Cash Election Number") and shall not be
greater than 40% of the number of shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be converted
pursuant to clause (x) of this Section 3.1(a)) (the "Maximum Cash Election
Number"). For purposes of determining both the Minimum Cash Election Number
and Maximum Cash Election Number, Dissenting Stockholders shall be deemed to
have made a Cash Election (as defined below) unless such Dissenting
Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) their right to payment as dissenting shareholders under the TBCA at
or prior to the Effective Time. The number of shares of Seller Common Stock to
be converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration shall be not less
than 60% of the number of shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to be cancelled
pursuant to clause (x) of this Section 3.1(a)) (the "Minimum Stock Election
Number") and not greater than 65% of the number of shares of Seller Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding shares to
be cancelled pursuant to clause (x) of this Section 3.1(a)) (the "Maximum
Stock Election Number"). 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

Subject to the proration and election procedures set forth in this Section
3.1(a), each holder of record of shares of Seller Common Stock (excluding
any treasury shares, shares held by Acquiror or any of the subsidiaries of
Acquiror or Seller (other than in a fiduciary capacity) and shares held by
Dissenting Stockholders) will be entitled to elect to receive (a) Cash
Consideration for all such shares (a "Cash Election"), (b) Stock
Consideration for all of such shares (a "Stock Election") or (c) Cash   

---|---|--- 



 

Exhibit A Â– Page 3  Consideration for 40% of such shares and Stock Consideration for 60% of such
shares (a "Combination Election"). All such elections shall be made on a form
designed for that purpose prepared by Acquiror and reasonably acceptable to
Seller (a "Form of Election"). The Form of Election will include appropriate
stock certificate transmittal materials which transmittal materials shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon delivery of a certificate or certificates representing shares
of Seller Common Stock to the Exchange Agent (as defined below)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender to the Exchange Agent of
certificates of Seller Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Holders of record of shares of Seller Common Stock who hold such shares as
nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities (a "Representative")
may submit multiple Forms of Election, provided that such Representative
certifies that each such Form of Election covers all the shares of Seller
Common Stock held by each such Representative for a particular beneficial
owner. 

---|--- 



     | (iv) | Acquiror and Seller shall mail the Form of Election
(including the stock certificate transmittal materials) to all Persons who are
holders of record of Seller Common Stock on the record date for the Special
Meeting, on a date that is not less than 20 Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, and thereafter Acquiror and Seller shall each use its
reasonable efforts to make the Form of Election available to all Persons
who become holders of Seller Common Stock subsequent to such day and no later
than the close of business on the fifth Business Day prior to the Effective
Time. A Form of Election must be received by the Exchange Agent in the manner
described below no later than by the close of business on the Business Day
which is four Business Days immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Election Deadline") in order to be effective. All elections will be
irrevocable. As used herein "Special Meeting" shall mean the special meeting
of the shareholders of Seller to approve the Merger Agreement, these Articles
of Merger and the Merger. 
---|---|--- 


     | (v) |

Elections shall be made by holders of Seller Common Stock by mailing or
otherwise delivering to the Exchange Agent, in a manner acceptable to
Acquiror, a Form of Election. "Exchange Agent" shall mean the person mutually
acceptable to Acquiror and Seller who is selected to act as exchange agent to
perform the services specified in the Merger Agreement. To be effective, a
Form of Election must be properly completed, signed and submitted to the
Exchange Agent. The Form of Election shall be deemed properly completed only
if accompanied by one or more certificates representing all shares of Seller
Common Stock covered by such Form of Election, together with duly executed
transmittal materials included with the Form of Election. Acquiror will have
the discretion, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange
Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election have been properly completed,
signed and submitted and to disregard immaterial defects in   

---|---|--- 



 

Exhibit A Â– Page 4  Forms of Election. The decision of Acquiror (or the Exchange Agent) in such
matters shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Acquiror nor the Exchange
Agent will be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in a
Form of Election. 

---|--- 



     | (vi) | A holder of Seller Common Stock who does not submit a Form
of Election which is received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election
Deadline shall be deemed to have made a Combination Election. If Acquiror or
the Exchange Agent shall determine that any purported Cash Election or Stock
Election was not properly made, such purported Cash Election or Stock Election
shall be deemed to be of no force and effect and the holder of shares of
Seller Common Stock making such purported Cash Election or Stock Election
shall for purposes hereof be deemed to have made a Combination Election. 
---|---|--- 


     | (vii) |

All shares of Seller Common Stock which are subject to Cash Elections are
referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares." All shares of Seller
Common Stock which are subject to Stock Elections are referred to herein as
"Stock Election Shares." If, after the results of the Forms of Election are
calculated, the number of shares of Seller Common Stock to be converted into
shares of Acquiror Common Stock exceeds the Maximum Stock Election Number,
the Exchange Agent shall, after the Election Deadline but prior to the
Effective Time, determine the number of Stock Election Shares which must be
redesignated as Cash Election Shares in order to reduce the number of such
shares to the Maximum Stock Election Number. All holders who have Stock
Election Shares shall, on a pro rata basis, have such number of their Stock
Election Shares redesignated as Cash Election Shares so that the Maximum
Stock Election Number and the Minimum Cash Election Number are achieved. If,
after the results of the Forms of Election are calculated, the number of
shares of Seller Common Stock to be converted into cash exceeds the Maximum
Cash Election Number, the Exchange Agent shall, after the Election Deadline
but prior to the Effective Time, determine the number of Cash Election Shares
which must be redesignated as Stock Election Shares in order to reduce the
amount of such cash to the Maximum Cash Election Number. All holders who have
Cash Election Shares shall, on a pro rata basis, have such number of their
Cash Election Shares redesignated as Stock Election Shares so that the Maximum
Cash Election Number and the Minimum Stock Election Number are achieved.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no redesignation shall be effected for a holder
who has made a Cash Election but, as a result of such redesignation, would
receive fewer than 10 shares of Acquiror Common Stock in exchange for all of
such holderÂ’s shares of Seller Common Stock. In this event, the Cash Election
Shares of the remaining holders of shares of Seller Common Stock shall be
redesignated on a pro rata basis to achieve the Maximum Cash Election Number
and the Minimum Stock Election Number. Holders who make Combination Elections
will not be subject to the redesignation procedures described   

---|---|--- 



 

Exhibit A Â– Page 5  herein. Dissenting Stockholders who are deemed to have made Cash Elections
shall not be subject to the redesignation procedure described herein. Acquiror
or the Exchange Agent shall make all computations contemplated by this
Section 3.1(a) and all such computations shall be conclusive and binding on
the holders of Seller Common Stock. 

---|--- 


     | (viii) | It is the intent of the parties that the Parent Merger
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"). In order to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368 of the Code, the Parent Merger must satisfy the Continuity of
Interest requirement set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e). If
after the Exchange Agent completes the redesignation procedures set forth in
Section 2.1(a)(vii) (or if there is no redesignation required by the Exchange
Agent after the Exchange Agent notifies the parties that redesignation is not
required), the Acquiror determines that the value of Acquiror Common Stock
included in the Merger Consideration will not be sufficient to satisfy the
Continuity of Interest requirement, then Acquiror shall increase the Exchange
Ratio and decrease the Price Per Share to the extent Acquiror deems necessary
to meet the Continuity of Interest requirement. The adjustment of the Exchange
Ratio and the Price Per Share by Acquiror under this Section 2.1(a)(viii)
shall be conclusive and binding on the parties to this Agreement. For purposes
of this Section 2.1(a)(viii), the Continuity of Interest requirement is
agreed to be at least 40% continuity. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | After the redesignation procedure, if any, set forth in
Sections 3.1(a)(vii) and (viii), respectively, are completed, all Cash
Election Shares and 40% of the shares of Seller Common Stock which are
subject to Combination Elections shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration, and all Stock Election Shares and 60% of the shares of
Seller Common Stock which are subject to Combination Elections shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. Such
certificates previously evidencing shares of Seller Common Stock shall be
exchanged for (a) certificates evidencing the Stock Consideration, or (b) the
Cash Consideration, multiplied in each case by the number of shares
previously evidenced by the cancelled certificate, upon the surrender of such
certificates to the Exchange Agent, without interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, no fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be
issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section
3.1(b). 
---|---|--- 



     | (x) | Each share of Seller Common Stock held in the treasury of
Seller and each share of Seller Common Stock owned by Acquiror or any
subsidiary of Acquiror or Seller (other than in a fiduciary capacity)
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto. 
---|---|--- 


 

Exhibit A Â– Page 6 (b) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock will be issued as a result of the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement, cash
adjustments (without interest) will be paid to the holder of Seller Common
Stock in respect of any fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock that
would otherwise be issuable to such holder of Seller Common Stock, and the
amount of such cash adjustment shall be determined by multiplying the fraction
of a share of Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable by the average of the
closing price of one share of Acquiror Common Stock for the 10 trading days
immediately preceding the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing
Date as reported by the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and no such holder shall
be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other right of stockholders in
respect of any fractional share.

3.2 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR STOCK AND/OR CASH. After the Effective Time,
each holder of a certificate previously representing outstanding shares of
Seller Common Stock shall surrender and exchange such certificates for the
Merger Consideration in the manner provided in Section 2.2 of the Merger
Agreement.

3.3 DISSENTING SHARES. No outstanding share of Seller Common Stock as to which
the holder has exercised dissenters rights under the TCA and did not vote for
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and these Articles of Merger shall be
converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
the holder thereof (such holder, a "Dissenting Stockholder") shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the TCA. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) his right to such payment at or prior to the Effective Time, such
holderÂ’s shares of the Seller Common Stock shall be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Merger Agreement and these Articles of Merger as if such holder had
made a Combination Election. If such holder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment after the
Effective Time, each share of the Seller Common Stock of such holder shall be
converted, on a share-by-share basis, into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Merger
Agreement and these Articles of Merger as if such holder had made a
Combination Election. 

ARTICLE IV

MISCELLANEOUS

4.1 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT. The respective obligations of each party under these
Articles of Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by the
party permitted to do so, of the conditions set forth in Article VI of the
Merger Agreement.

4.2 TERMINATION. These Articles of Merger shall be terminated automatically
without further act or deed of either of the parties hereto in the event of
the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with Article VII
thereof. 

4.3. AMENDMENTS. To the extent permitted by the MBCA and the TCA, these
Articles of Merger may be amended by a subsequent writing signed by each of
the parties hereto upon the approval of the Board of Directors of each of the
parties hereto; provided, however, that  



 

Exhibit A Â– Page 7  the provisions of Article III of these Articles of Merger relating to the
consideration to be paid for the shares of Seller Common Stock shall not be
amended after the Stockholder Meeting so as to modify either the amount or
the form of such consideration (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding
adjustments to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 3.1(a)(viii) above and
Section 7.1 of the Merger Agreement) or to otherwise materially adversely
affect the stockholders of Seller without the approval of the stockholders of
Seller.

4.4 SUCCESSORS. These Articles of Merger shall be binding on the successors
of Acquiror and Seller.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Acquiror and Seller have caused this Plan of Merger to be
executed by their duly authorized officers as of the day and year first above
written.

JOINDER AGREEMENT



 

Schedule 5.13(b) JOINDER AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT is made and executed as of the ____ day of January, 2007
between Renasant Corporation, a Mississippi corporation ("Acquiror"), and the
undersigned individual officer and/or director ("Capital Official") of
Capital Bancorp, Inc., a Tennessee corporation ("Capital"), or Capital Bank and
Trust Company, a Tennessee banking association ("Capital Bank").

RECITALS:

WHEREAS, Acquiror, Renasant Bank, a Mississippi banking association (the
"Acquiror Bank"), Capital and Capital Bank have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Capital will be
merged into Acquiror and Acquiror shall be the surviving entity on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and Capital
Bank will be merged into Acquiror Bank and Acquiror Bank shall be the
surviving entity on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in such
Merger Agreement; and

WHEREAS, in consideration of the agreements made by Capital in connection
with the Merger Agreement, Acquiror has agreed to indemnify the Capital
Official under certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of AcquirorÂ’s agreement to indemnify the
Capital Official and the expenses and costs that may be incurred by Acquiror
in connection with such indemnification, the Capital Official hereby agrees
as follows:

1\. _Assumption of and Cooperation in Defense_.

1.1 _Notice and Assumption of Defense_. In the event a claim arises for which
indemnification is or may be sought by the Capital Official, the Capital
Official shall promptly notify Acquiror, in writing at the address set forth
in Section 3 hereof, of the commencement of such legal action or existence of
and facts relating to such claim. Upon receipt of such notice, or at any
time thereafter, Acquiror shall be entitled to participate therein and, in
its sole discretion, to assume the defense of such claim, with counsel of its
choice, subject to the reasonable approval of the Capital Official, and to
consider and decide on any proposed settlement, subject to the reasonable
approval of the Capital Official. In any and all events, Acquiror shall have
the right to reasonable control over the nature and extent of expenses
incurred in connection with such claim(s). Acquiror shall notify the Capital
Official of its assumption of the defense of such claim; and after such notice
from Acquiror to the Capital Official, Acquiror shall not be liable to the
Capital Official for indemnification under Section 5.13(b) of the Merger
Agreement for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses of
defense subsequently incurred by such indemnified party.

1.2 _Cooperation in Defense_. The Capital Official agrees to cooperate in the
defense of any action for which indemnification is sought under Section
5.13(b) of the Merger Agreement.



 

Schedule 5.13(b) Â– Page 1 Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, providing Acquiror and
its counsel copies of any and all relevant documents relating to the claim,
consulting with Acquiror and its counsel with regard to the claim, providing
testimony, either in deposition or at trial or both, regarding the facts
relating to the claim, making himself available at reasonable times for
consultation, testimony and fact-finding and otherwise furnishing such
information to Acquiror and its counsel as the Capital Official would provide
to his own counsel in the event he were defending the action himself. Except
as expressly permitted by Acquiror, the Capital Official shall not object to
the production or use of any documents heretofore prepared by or of
information provided to Acquiror legal counsel on the basis of any claim of
privilege that is available only to Capital or Acquiror; provided, however,
that Acquiror agrees that it will not, without the consent of the Capital
Official, waive any applicable privilege of the Capital Official. Such
cooperation shall be provided regardless of whether Acquiror assumes the
defense of the action.

2\. _Duplication of Payment; Limitations; Presumptions_.

2.1 _No Duplication of Payments_. Acquiror shall not be liable under this
Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim against
the Capital Official to the extent the Capital Official has otherwise
actually received payment (under any insurance policy, certificate of
incorporation, bylaw provision or otherwise) of amounts otherwise
indemnifiable hereunder.

2.2 _Limitation on Liability_. The Capital Official hereby expressly
acknowledges and agrees that Acquiror shall not be liable in the aggregate
for more than the Indemnification Cap (as defined in the Merger Agreement) in
connection with its obligations under Section 5.13(b) of the Merger Agreement.
The Capital Official further acknowledges and agrees that he shall have no
claim against Acquiror for any amount that, when aggregated with
indemnification amounts paid by Acquiror to other Capital Officials that would
be subject to the Indemnification Cap as provided in the Merger Agreement (the
"Capped Amount"), exceeds the Indemnification Cap (as defined in the Merger
Agreement). Any claim for reallocation of the amounts paid by Acquiror among
Capital Officials shall be made against the other Capital Official(s)
involved, and Acquiror shall not be liable in any way for the allocation of
such Capped Amount among Capital Officials.

2.3 _No Presumption_. For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement (whether with
or without court approval) shall not of itself create a presumption that the
Capital Official did or did not meet any particular standard of conduct or
have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification
is not permitted by applicable law.

3\. _Notices_. All notices or other communications which are required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and sufficient if delivered personally
or sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (receipt
requested), at the addresses listed below:

AFFILIATE LETTER



 

Schedule 5.16 [date]

Renasant Corporation

209 Troy Street

Tupelo, MS 38801

Gentlemen:

This letter agreement is given in connection with the closing of the merger
(the "Merger") of Capital Bancorp, Inc. ("Seller") with and into Renasant
Corporation ("Acquiror"). I am aware and acknowledge that, as a member of the
Board of Directors or an officer of Seller or the beneficial owner of a
substantial amount of the outstanding common stock of Seller, I may be an
"affiliate" of Seller as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the regulations thereunder.

I understand the resales or other dispositions of AcquirorÂ’s common stock,
$5.00 per share par value ("Acquiror Common Stock"), acquired by me as a
result of the Merger may be governed by Rules 144 and 145 of the Securities
Act.

On the basis of the foregoing, and in consideration of the delivery to me of
the Acquiror Common Stock into which my Seller common stock will be converted,
I agree that I will not, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge or
otherwise alienate or encumber any of the Acquiror Common Stock held by me in
violation of the Securities Act or the rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder. In addition, I expressly agree to the placement of a
restrictive legend on any and all certificates representing Acquiror Common
Stock of which I am the beneficial owner reflecting the restrictions described
above.

LOCK-UP AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT



 

Schedule 5.20-A Â– Page 1 LOCK-UP AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

This Agreement is made and executed as of the ____ day of January ____, 2007,
between Renasant Corporation, a Mississippi corporation ("Acquiror"), and the
undersigned non-employee director ("Capital Official") of Capital Bancorp,
Inc., a Tennessee corporation ("Capital"), or Capital Bank and Trust Company, a
Tennessee banking association ("Capital Bank").

Acquiror, Renasant Bank, a Mississippi banking association ("Acquiror Bank"),
Capital and Capital Bank have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the "Plan of Merger"), pursuant to which the parties thereto agree that (i)
Capital will merge (the "Merger") with and into Acquiror, and Acquiror shall
be the surviving entity of the Merger, and (ii) Capital Bank and Acquiror Bank
will merge (the "Bank Merger") with and into Acquiror Bank, and Acquiror Bank
shall be the surviving entity of the Bank Merger. In consideration of the
expenses that Acquiror will incur in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Plan of Merger, and in order to preserve the value of the
franchise to be purchased by Acquiror and induce Acquiror to proceed to incur
such expenses, the Capital Official makes the following agreements in favor of
Acquiror:



   1. | Undertakings of Capital Official 
---|--- 

1.1 The Capital Official agrees and undertakes to vote or cause to be voted
in favor of the approval of the Plan of Merger all shares of common stock of
Capital, no par value (the "Capital Stock"), as to which he has voting power
(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity), which amount of shares is
shown on the schedule attached hereto and made a part hereof, at any meeting
or meetings (including any and all adjournments thereof) held on or before
June 30, 2007. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing in this
section or this Agreement is intended to dictate or require that the Capital
Official vote as a director in any manner.

1.2 The Capital Official further agrees that he will not transfer any of the
shares of Capital Stock over which he has dispositive power, which number of
shares is shown on the schedule attached hereto and made a part hereof, until
the vote upon the Plan of Merger by CapitalÂ’s stockholders has been taken or
until the Plan of Merger has been terminated pursuant to the provisions
thereof, except (i) for transfers by operation of law, and (ii) for transfers
in connection with which Acquiror has consented to the transfer and the
transferee shall agree in writing with Acquiror to be bound by this Agreement
as fully as the undersigned.

1.3 This Agreement shall terminate at such time as the Plan of Merger
terminates.



   2. | _Noncompetition Obligations of Capital Official_. 
---|--- 



 

Schedule 5.20-A Â– Page 1 2.1 Capital Official will not:

(a) directly or indirectly, for himself or in affiliation with any business or
entity in which he owns an equity or financial interest (except as to
not more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any corporation,
the securities of which are regularly traded on a nationally recognized
securities exchange or over-the-counter market), carry on or engage in any
Competitive Business (as hereinafter defined) within the Restricted Area (as
hereinafter defined); or

(b) directly or indirectly, in affiliation with any individual or any
business or entity not covered by (a) above, whether as a partner, employee,
contractor, consultant or otherwise, carry on or engage in any Competitive
Business in the Restricted Area; or

(c) directly or indirectly, solicit or cause to be solicited any customers of
the Acquiror or Acquiror Bank, with respect to any Competitive Business
in the Restricted Area; or

(d) directly or indirectly, solicit or cause to be solicited any employees,
contractors or agents of the Acquiror or the Acquiror Bank to terminate their
employment, contract or relationship with the Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Restricted Area" shall mean the
following counties in the State of Tennessee: Davidson, Marshall, Rutherford,
Sumner, Trousdale, Wilson and Williamson, and the term "Competitive Business"
shall mean the business of banking, including, without limitation, checking
and savings accounts, business and personal loans, interim construction and
residential loans, student loans, automated tellers machines, internet banking
services and accounts receivable financing. For the avoidance of doubt,
"Competitive Business" shall exclude equipment leasing, insurance agency
services, trust services and investment advisory services and any entity in
which the Capital Official has an ownership interest on the date of this
Agreement.

2.2. The noncompetition obligations set forth in Section 2.1 shall extend
until the second anniversary of the Closing (as defined in the Plan of
Merger) (the "Restricted Period").

2.3. The Acquiror and the Capital Official agree that the foregoing
restrictions are reasonable under the circumstances and that any breach of the
covenants contained in this Section 2 would cause irreparable injury to the
Acquiror. The Capital Official understands that the foregoing restrictions
may limit the Capital OfficialÂ’s ability to engage in certain businesses
during the period provided for above in the Restricted Area, but acknowledges
that the Capital Official will receive sufficient remuneration and other
benefits under the Plan of Merger to justify such restriction. Further, the
Capital Official acknowledges that his skills are such that he can be
gainfully employed in non-competitive employment, and that the agreement not
to compete will in no way prevent him from earning a living. If any of the
aforesaid restrictions are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise
unenforceable, the parties intend for the restrictions therein set forth
to be modified by the court making such determination so as to be reasonable
and enforceable and, as so modified, to be fully enforced. By agreeing to this
contractual modification prospectively at this time, the parties intend to
make this provision enforceable under the laws of Mississippi in the
Restricted Area so that the entire agreement not to compete and this Agreement
as  



 

Schedule 5.20-A Â– Page 2  prospectively modified shall remain in full force and effect and shall not
be rendered void or illegal.

2.4. The Capital Official acknowledges that money damages would not be
sufficient remedy for any breach of this Section 2 by the Capital
Official, and the Acquiror shall be entitled to seek to enforce the
provisions of this Section 2 by specific performance and injunctive relief as
remedies for such breach or any threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be
deemed the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Section 2, but shall be in
addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Acquiror,
including, without limitation, the recovery of damages from the Capital
Official and his or her agents involved in such breach.



   3. | _Miscellaneous_ 
---|--- 

3.1 The provisions of this Agreement shall be enforceable through an action
for damages at law or a suit for specific performance or other appropriate
extraordinary relief, the Capital Official acknowledging that remedies at law
for breach or default might be or become inadequate.

3.2 The Capital Official acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is
executed in connection with the sale of all of the business of Capital. The
Capital Official further acknowledges and represents that the provisions of
this Agreement will not work a hardship on him and will not prevent him from
engaging in his occupation.

3.3 To the extent permitted under applicable law, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or modified at any time, either before or after
its approval by an agreement in writing among the parties hereto.

3.4 This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed to constitute an original. Each such counterpart shall become
effective when one counterpart has been signed by each party hereto.

3.5 This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Mississippi applicable to agreements made and
entirely to be performed within such State, except as federal law may be
applicable. 

3.6 The Capital Official may not assign any of his rights or obligations under
this Agreement to any other person.

3.7 This Agreement supersedes any and all oral or written agreements and
understandings heretofore made between the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement of the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Agreement does not modify or amend any stock option
agreement, employment agreement, option or similar employee benefit agreement
between Capital or an affiliate of Capital and the Capital Official. The terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, heirs and legatees.



 

Schedule 5.20-A Â– Page 3 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have signed this Agreement effective as of the
date first set forth above.

Schedule 5.20-C RENASANT CORPORATION

EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between R. Rick Hart
("Executive") and Renasant Corporation, a Mississippi corporation (the
"Company"), and is intended to supersede and replace, in its entirety, that
certain Employment Agreement dated December 13, 2000 between Capital Bank and
Trust Company, which Renasant Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
acquired by merger effective as of the Effective Date (as defined below), and
Executive (the "Prior Agreement"). The Prior Agreement has been terminated
effective as of the Effective Date pursuant to that certain Termination and
Release Agreement by and among Executive, Capital Bancorp, Inc. and Capital
Bank and Trust Company.



   1. | Employment And Term: 
---|--- 

1.1 Position. The Company shall employ and retain Executive as the President
of the Tennessee Division of the Company or in such other capacity or
capacities as shall be mutually agreed upon, from time to time, by Executive
and the Company, and Executive agrees to be so employed, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein. ExecutiveÂ’s duties and responsibilities shall
be those assigned to him hereunder, from time to time, by the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company (the "Chief Executive") and shall include such duties
as are the type and nature normally assigned to similar executive officers of
a corporation of the size, type and stature of the Company. Executive shall
report to the Chief Executive Officer. 

1.2 Concurrent Employment. During the term of this Agreement, Executive and
the Company acknowledge that Executive may be concurrently employed by the
Company and Renasant Bank and one or more additional subsidiaries or other
entities with respect to which the Company owns (within the meaning of Section
425(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) 50% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or other
equity interests (an "Affiliate"), and that all of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement shall apply to such concurrent employment. Reference to the
Company hereunder shall be deemed to include any such concurrent employers,
unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary.

1.3 Full Time and Attention. During the term of this Agreement and any
extensions or renewals thereof, Executive shall devote his full business time,
attention and energies to the business of the Company and will not, without
the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Board"), be engaged (whether or not during normal business hours) in any
other business or professional activity, whether or not such activities are
pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be prevented from (a)
engaging in any civic or charitable activity for which Executive receives no
compensation or other pecuniary advantage, (b) investing his personal assets
in businesses which do not compete with the Company, provided that such
investment will not require any services on the part of Executive in the
operation of the affairs of the businesses in which investments are made and
provided further that ExecutiveÂ’s participation in such businesses is solely
that of an investor, or (c) purchasing securities in any corporation whose
securities are regularly traded, provided that such purchases will not result
in Executive owning beneficially at any time 5% or more of the equity
securities of any corporation engaged in a business competitive with that
of the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company expressly
approves of ExecutiveÂ’s indefinite, continuing involvement with the following
entities: Southern Methodist University Graduate School of Banking, Southern
Methodist University Bank Advisory Board, Prevent Blindness America,
Tennessee Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America
(collectively, the "Approved  



 

Schedule 5.20-C Â– Page 1  Business-Related Activities") and Clayton Whitney Design, provided that such
continuing involvement as to each such entity does not materially vary in the
type or degree of involvement with such entity as existed prior to the
Effective Date.

1.4 Term. ExecutiveÂ’s employment under this Agreement shall commence as of
the Effective Time of the Parent Merger (each as defined in that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of February 5, 2007 by and among the
Company, Renasant Bank, Capital Bancorp, Inc. and Capital Bank and Trust
Company (the "Merger Agreement")) (the date on which employment commences
hereunder is referred to as the "Effective Date"), and shall terminate on
December 31, 2012 (such period referred to as the "Initial Term"). Commencing
on January 1, 2011 and on January 1st of each subsequent year thereafter,
ExecutiveÂ’s Employment Term shall automatically be extended for an additional
one-year period; provided, however, that either party may provide written
notice to the other that the Employment Term shall not be further extended,
such notice to be provided not later than October 1st of the previous year and
to take effect as of the last day of the then current term (the date on which
employment hereunder ceases for any reason is referred to as the "Termination
Date"); the period between the Effective Date and the Termination Date
referred to herein as the "Employment Term").



   2. | Compensation And Benefits:

if it was due primarily to an error in judgment or negligence, but will be
deemed "intentional" only if done or omitted to be done by Executive not in

to Executive (collectively, the "Aggregate Payments") in connection with a
change in control of Capital Bancorp, Inc. and/or Capital Bank and Trust
Company or a change in control of the Company and its Affiliates, as
contemplated under Section 280G of the Code, would result in a "parachute
payment," as defined under Section 280G, Executive shall be paid the

by Executive (after taking into account all federal, state and local income
taxes payable by Executive and the amount of any excise tax under Section
4999 of the Code (or any successor provision) that would be payable by
Executive) has a materially greater aggregate value than the after-tax amount
that would be retained by Executive (after taking into account all federal,
state and local income taxes payable by Executive) if Executive were to
receive the Aggregate Payments reduced by the minimum amount necessary as
would result in no portion of the Aggregate Payments, as so reduced, being
subject to the excise tax under Section 4999\. The determination of whether a
reduction is required under this Section 4.3 shall be made by an independent
accountant designated by the Company and shall be binding on the parties
hereto. To the extent practicable, Executive shall be entitled to select the
payments or benefits subject to reduction hereunder.



   5. | Limitations On Activities:

the foregoing, this provision shall not apply to any property for which no
equipment, supplies, facilities or information of the Company was used and
which was  



 

Schedule 5.20-C Â– Page 9  developed entirely during ExecutiveÂ’s own time, unless such property relates
to the business of the Company or an Affiliate or results from any
work performed by Executive for the Company or an Affiliate.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" shall mean
all inventions, discoveries, creations, improvements, techniques, trade
secrets, products (utility or design), works of authorship or any other
intellectual property relating to any programming, documentation, technology,

Executive conceives, develops or delivers, in whole or in part, during the
Employment Term.

5.3 Confidential Information. Executive recognizes and acknowledges that
during the Employment Term he will have access to confidential, proprietary,
non-public information concerning the Company and its Affiliates, which may
include, without limitation, (a) books, records and policies relating to
operations, finance, accounting, personnel and management, (b)
information related to any business entered into by the Company or an
Affiliate, (c) credit policies and practices, databases, customer lists,

accounts relating to consumer products and services (collectively,
"Confidential Information"). Executive agrees that he will not at any time,
either during the Employment Term or afterwards, make any independent use of,
or disclose to any other person or organization any Confidential Information,
except as may be expressly authorized by the Company, in the ordinary course
of ExecutiveÂ’s employment with the Company and its Affiliates or as may be
required by law or legal process.

5.4 Non-solicitation. Executive agrees that during the one-year period
commencing on the Termination Date, he shall not, directly or indirectly, for
his own benefit or on behalf of another or to the CompanyÂ’s detriment:

of any of the CompanyÂ’s or AffiliateÂ’s officers, employees or agents; 
---|---|---

customer or depositor of the Company or an Affiliate.

term "Banking Business" shall mean the management and/or operation of a
retail bank or other financial institution, securities brokerage or insurance
agency or brokerage. The term "Restricted Area" shall mean within the
100-mile radius of any geographic location in which the Company or an
Affiliate has an office on the Termination Date.



 

Schedule 5.20-C Â– Page 10 5.6 Business Reputation. Executive agrees that during the Employment Term and
at all times thereafter, he shall refrain from performing any act, engaging
in any conduct or course of action or making or publishing an adverse, untrue
or misleading statement which has or may reasonably have the effect of
demeaning the name or business reputation of the Company or its Affiliates or
which adversely affects (or may reasonably adversely affect) the best
interests (economic or otherwise) of the Company or an Affiliate, except as
may be required by law or legal process. 

5.7 Reformation. The parties agree that each of the prohibitions set forth
herein is intended to constitute a separate restriction. Accordingly, should
any such prohibition be declared invalid or unenforceable, such prohibition
shall be deemed severable from and shall not affect the remainder thereof. The
parties further agree that each of the foregoing restrictions is reasonable
in both time and geographic scope. If and to the extent a court of competent
jurisdiction or an arbitrator, as the case may be, determines that any of the
restrictions or covenants set forth in this Agreement are unreasonable, then
it is the intention of the parties that such restrictions be enforced to the
fullest extent that such court or arbitrator deems reasonable and that this
Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to permit such
enforcement.

5.8 Remedies. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Executive of
the provisions of Section 5 hereof, Executive agrees that the Company shall
be entitled to a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction
(without the necessity of posting bond in connection therewith) and that any
additional payments or benefits due to Executive or his dependents under
Sections 3 and 4 hereof may be suspended, canceled, or forfeited, in the sole
discretion of the Company. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting
the Company from pursuing any other remedy available to it for such breach or
threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from Executive.



   6. | Miscellaneous: 
---|--- 

6.1 Mitigation Not Required. As a condition of any payment hereunder,
Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of such payment by
seeking other employment or otherwise, nor will any profits, income, earnings
or other benefits from any source whatsoever create any mitigation, offset,
reduction or any other obligation on the part of Executive under this
Agreement.

6.2 Enforcement of This Agreement. In addition to the CompanyÂ’s equitable
remedies provided under Section 5.8 hereof, which need not be exclusively
resolved by arbitration, in the event that any legal dispute arises in
connection with, relating to, or concerning this Agreement, or in the event
of any claim for breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement,
Executive agrees that such dispute or claim will be resolved by arbitration.
Any such arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the
Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Any such dispute or claim will be presented
to a single arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of the Executive and the
Company (or the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the rules of
the AAA). All determinations of the arbitrator will be final and biding upon
the Executive and the Company. Each party to the arbitration proceeding will
bear its own costs in connection with such arbitration proceedings, except
that the costs and expenses of the arbitrator will be divided evenly between
the parties. The venue for any arbitration proceeding and for any judicial
proceeding related to this arbitration provision (including a judicial
proceeding to enforce this provision) will be in Tupelo, Mississippi.

6.3 AttorneysÂ’ Fees. In the event any dispute in connection with this
Agreement arises with respect to obligations of Executive or the Company that
were required prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control, all costs, fees
and expenses, including attorneysÂ’ fees, of any litigation, arbitration or
other  



 

Schedule 5.20-C Â– Page 11  legal action in connection with such matters in which Executive
substantially prevails, shall be borne by, and be the obligation of, the
Company.

 

After a Change in Control has occurred, Executive shall not be required to
incur legal fees and the related expenses associated with the interpretation,
enforcement or defense of ExecutiveÂ’s rights under this Agreement by
arbitration, litigation or otherwise. Accordingly, if following a Change in
Control, the Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations under
this Agreement or the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take
any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable or in any way
reduce the possibility of collecting the amounts due hereunder, or institutes
any litigation or other action or proceeding designed to deny or to recover
from Executive the benefits provided or intended to be provided under this
Agreement, Executive shall be entitled to retain counsel of ExecutiveÂ’s
choice, at the expense of the Company, to advise and represent Executive in
connection with any such interpretation, enforcement or defense, including
without limitation the initiation or defense of any litigation, arbitration or
other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any director,
officer, stockholder or other person affiliated with the Company, in any
jurisdiction. The Company shall pay and be solely financially responsible for
any and all attorneysÂ’ and related fees and expenses incurred by Executive
in connection with any of the foregoing, without regard to whether Executive
prevails, in whole or in part.

In no event shall Executive be required to reimburse the Company for any of
the costs and expenses incurred by the Company relating to arbitration,
litigation or other legal action in connection with this Agreement.

6.4 No Set-Off. There shall be no right of set-off or counterclaim in respect
of any claim, debt or obligation against any payment to Executive provided
for in this Agreement.

6.5 Assistance with Litigation. For a period of two years after the
Termination Date, Executive will furnish such information and proper
assistance as may be reasonably necessary in connection with any litigation in
which the Company (or an Affiliate) is then or may become involved, without
the payment of a fee or charge, except reimbursement of his direct expenses.

6.6 Headings. Section and other headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

6.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the final and complete
understanding and agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and there are no other agreements, understandings,
restrictions, representations or warranties among the parties other than those
set forth herein. Executive acknowledges that this Agreement replaces in
their entirety any prior agreements between Executive and the Company or its
Affiliates concerning the subject covered by this Agreement, including the
Prior Agreement.

 

6.8 Amendments. Except as provided in Section 5.7 hereof, this Agreement may
be amended or modified at any time in any or all respects, but only by an
instrument in writing executed by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may amend this Agreement to the extent it deems
necessary or appropriate to ensure that any payment hereunder shall not be
subject to income inclusion under Section 409A of the Code prior the date on
which such amount is otherwise payable hereunder. The Company shall promptly
provide to Executive written notice of any such amendment.

6.9 Choice of Law. The validity of this Agreement, the construction of its
terms, and the determination of the rights and duties of the parties hereto
shall be governed by and construed in  



 

Schedule 5.20-C Â– Page 12  accordance with the internal laws of the State of Mississippi applicable to
contracts made to be performed wholly within such state, without regard to
the choice of law provisions thereof.

6.10 Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement must
be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered
by hand, (b) sent by facsimile to a facsimile number given below, provided

acknowledges that neither the Company or any Affiliate nor the directors,

advice about the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the
taxation of benefits and payments hereunder, and that such parties have no
ongoing obligation to do so.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be prevented from (a)
engaging in any civic or charitable activity for which Executive receives no

provided further that ExecutiveÂ’s participation in such businesses is solely
that of an investor, or (c) purchasing securities in any corporation whose

of the compensation or benefits described above and such other benefits or
amounts as may be required by law.

3.2 Termination for Death or Disability. If Executive dies or becomes
Disabled during the Employment Term, this Agreement and ExecutiveÂ’s employment
hereunder shall immediately terminate. In such event, the Company shall pay to
Executive (or to his surviving spouse or estate) the amounts described in
Sections 3.1a and 3.1b hereof. Payment shall be made in the form of a single-
sum as soon as practicable after ExecutiveÂ’s death or Disability or as and
when such amounts are ascertainable, but not later than March 15th of the
calendar year following the year in which ExecutiveÂ’s date of death or
Disability occurs.

For purposes of this Section 3.2, Executive shall be deemed "Disabled" if he
is subject to a substantial mental or physical disability for a period of more
than six full, consecutive calendar months or more than seven full calendar
months in any twelve-consecutive month period. The Board shall certify
whether Executive is Disabled as defined herein.

3.3 CompanyÂ’s Termination for Cause. This Agreement, and ExecutiveÂ’s
employment hereunder, may be terminated by the Company at any time on account
of Cause. In such event, the Company shall pay to Executive the amount
described in Section 3.1a hereof. Payment shall be made in the form of a
single-sum as soon as practicable after such termination.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any plan, policy or
program or other arrangement to the contrary, if ExecutiveÂ’s employment is
terminated for Cause as provided herein:



     | a. | He shall forfeit any options outstanding as of his
Termination Date granted by the Company or an Affiliate on or after the
Effective Date, whether or not vested; and  
---|---|---

subject to forfeiture restrictions or holding period limitations. 
---|---|--- 
For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" means that Executive has:

provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any of the rules adopted by
the Securities and Exchange Commission implementing any such provision. 
---|---|--- 

No act or failure to act on the part of Executive will be deemed "intentional"
if it was due primarily to an error in judgment or negligence, but will be
deemed "intentional" only if done or omitted to be done by Executive not in
good faith and without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in
the best interest of the Company (or an Affiliate).

The Chief Executive, acting in good faith, may terminate ExecutiveÂ’s
employment hereunder on account of Cause or it may separately determine that
any termination is on account of Cause. The Chief Executive shall provide
written notice to Executive, including a description of the specific reasons
for the determination of Cause. Executive shall have the opportunity
to appear before the Chief Executive, with or without legal representation,
to present arguments and evidence on his behalf. Following such presentation,
or upon ExecutiveÂ’s failure to appear, the Chief Executive shall confirm that
the actions or inactions of Executive constitute Cause hereunder.

3.4 ExecutiveÂ’s Constructive Termination. Executive may terminate
this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein, and his employment
hereunder on account of a Constructive Termination upon 30 days prior written
notice to the Board of Directors (or such shorter period as may be agreed upon
by the parties hereto). In such event, the Company shall provide to
Executive:

Schedule 5.20-E Â– Page 5 to perform (or omit to perform) any act or to engage (or omit to engage) in

Executive; or 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | A requirement by the Company that Executive shall change the
location of his primary place of employment to a location more than 30 miles
from the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Agreement and ExecutiveÂ’s employment hereunder, without Cause, upon 90 days
prior written notice to Executive, or such shorter period as may be agreed
upon by Executive and the Chief Executive. In such event, the Company shall
provide to Executive:



     | a. | The amount described in Section 3.1a hereof, payable as soon
as practicable following ExecutiveÂ’s Termination Date; and 
---|---|--- 


     | b. | The amounts determined under Sections 3.1b, 3.1c, 3.1d, and

3.6 Termination by Executive. Executive may terminate this Agreement and his
employment hereunder, other than on account of Constructive Termination, upon

agreed upon by the Chief Executive and Executive. In such event, the Company

hereunder, except as may be provided under a separate plan, policy or program
evidencing such compensation arrangement or benefit or as may be required by
law.

accordance with Section 1.3 hereof, the rights and obligations of the parties
hereto shall cease, ExecutiveÂ’s employment hereunder shall be terminated, and
the Company shall pay to Executive the amount described in Section 3.1a hereof
as soon as practicable following ExecutiveÂ’s Termination Date. 

3.8 Return of Property. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement and
the employment of Executive hereunder, for any reason, Executive or his

written certification that he has complied with the provisions of
this Section 3.8 not later than ten days after such termination.

duties and responsibilities contemplated in Section 1.1 hereof;

Reason unless (a) Executive gives the Company notice of his objection to such
event or condition within a reasonable period after Executive learns of such
event, which notice may be delivered orally or in writing to the Chief

of any agreement evidencing such grant or award. 
---|---|--- 

4.3 Limitation on Payments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if the aggregate present value of all payments and benefits due
to Executive under this Agreement and any other payment or benefit due from
the Company or an Affiliate (or any predecessor thereto), including, but not
limited to, pursuant to the Termination and Release Agreement by and among
Executive, Company, Capital Bancorp, Inc., and Capital Bank and Trust Company,
to Executive (collectively, the "Aggregate Payments") in connection with a
change in control of Capital Bancorp, Inc. and/or Capital Bank and Trust
Company or a change in control of the Company and its Affiliates, as
contemplated under Section 280G of the Code, would result in a "parachute
payment," as defined under Section 280G, Executive shall be paid the
Aggregate Payments provided that the after-tax amount that would be retained
by Executive (after taking into account all federal, state and local income
taxes payable by Executive and the amount of any excise tax under Section
4999 of the Code (or any successor provision) that would be payable by
Executive) has a materially greater aggregate value than the after-tax amount
that would be retained by Executive (after taking into account all federal,
state and local income taxes payable by Executive) if Executive were to
receive the Aggregate Payments reduced by the minimum amount necessary as
would result in no portion of the Aggregate Payments, as so reduced, being
subject to the excise tax under Section 4999\. The determination of whether a
reduction is required under this Section 4.3 shall be made by an independent
accountant designated by the Company and shall be binding on the parties
hereto. To the extent practicable, Executive shall be entitled to select the
payments or benefits subject to reduction hereunder.



   5. | Limitations On Activities: 
---|--- 

5.1. Consideration for Limitation on Activities. Executive acknowledges that
the execution of this Agreement and the payments described herein constitute
consideration for the limitations on activities set forth in this Section 5,
the adequacy of which is hereby expressly acknowledged by Executive.

5.2 Intellectual Property: The parties hereto agree that the Company owns
all Intellectual Property (as defined below) and associated goodwill.
Executive agrees to assign, and hereby assigns to the Company, without further
consideration or royalty, the ownership of and all rights to such Intellectual
Property and associated goodwill. The Company shall possess the right to own,
obtain and hold in its name any right, registration, or other protection or
recordation associated with such Intellectual Property, and Executive agrees
to perform, whether during the Employment Term or thereafter, such actions as
may be necessary or desirable to transfer, perfect and defend the CompanyÂ’s
ownership or registration of such property. Notwithstanding the generality of
the foregoing, this provision shall not apply to any property for which no
equipment, supplies, facilities or information of the Company was used and
which was developed entirely during ExecutiveÂ’s own time, unless such property
relates to the business of the Company or an Affiliate or results from any
work performed by Executive for the Company or an Affiliate.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" shall mean all
inventions, discoveries, creations, improvements, techniques, trade secrets,
products (utility or design), works of authorship or any other intellectual
property relating to any programming, documentation, technology,
material, product, service, idea, process, method, plan or strategy
concerning the business or interests of the Company and its Affiliates that
Executive conceives, develops or delivers, in whole or in part, during the
Employment Term.



 

Schedule 5.20-E Â– Page 9 5.3 Confidential Information. Executive recognizes and acknowledges that
during the Employment Term he will have access to confidential, proprietary,
non-public information concerning the Company and its Affiliates, which may
include, without limitation, (a) books, records and policies relating to
operations, finance, accounting, personnel and management, (b) information
related to any business entered into by the Company or an Affiliate, (c)
credit policies and practices, databases, customer lists, information obtained
on competitors, and tactics, (d) various other non-public trade or business
information, including business opportunities and strategies, marketing,
acquisition or business diversification plans, methods and processes, work
product, and (e) selling and operating policies and practices, including
without limitation, policies and practices concerning the identity,
solicitation, acquisition, management, resale or cancellation of unsecured or
secured credit card accounts, loan or lease accounts or other accounts
relating to consumer products and services (collectively, "Confidential
Information"). Executive agrees that he will not at any time, either during
the Employment Term or afterwards, make any independent use of, or disclose to
any other person or organization any Confidential Information, except as may
be expressly authorized by the Company, in the ordinary course of ExecutiveÂ’s
employment with the Company and its Affiliates or as may be required by law or
legal process.

5.4 Non-solicitation. Executive agrees that during the one-year period
commencing on the Termination Date, he shall not, directly or indirectly, for
his own benefit or on behalf of another or to the CompanyÂ’s detriment:



     | a. | Solicit, hire or offer to hire or participate in the hiring
of any of the CompanyÂ’s or AffiliateÂ’s officers, employees or agents; 
---|---|--- 


     | b. | Persuade or attempt to persuade in any manner any officer,
employee or agent of the Company or an Affiliate to discontinue any
relationship with the Company or an Affiliate; or  
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Solicit or divert or attempt to solicit or divert any
customer or depositor of the Company or an Affiliate. 
---|---|--- 
5.5 Non-competition. The Executive agrees that he shall not, for a period of
one year immediately following the Termination Date, whether as an employee,
officer, director, shareholder, owner, partner, joint venturer, independent
contractor, consultant or in another managerial capacity, engage in the
Banking Business in the Restricted Area. For purposes of this Section 5.5, the
term "Banking Business" shall mean the management and/or operation of a
retail bank or other financial institution, securities brokerage or insurance
agency or brokerage. The term "Restricted Area" shall mean within the
100-mile radius of any geographic location in which the Company or an
Affiliate has an office on the Termination Date.

5.6 Business Reputation. Executive agrees that during the Employment Term and
at all times thereafter, he shall refrain from performing any act, engaging in
any conduct or course of action or making or publishing an adverse, untrue or
misleading statement which has or may reasonably have the effect of demeaning
the name or business reputation of the Company or its Affiliates or which
adversely affects (or may reasonably adversely affect) the best interests
(economic or otherwise) of the Company or an Affiliate, except as may be
required by law or legal process.

5.7 Reformation. The parties agree that each of the prohibitions set forth
herein is intended to constitute a separate restriction. Accordingly, should
any such prohibition be declared invalid or unenforceable, such prohibition
shall be deemed severable from and shall not affect the remainder thereof.
The parties further agree that each of the foregoing restrictions is
reasonable in both time and  



 

Schedule 5.20-E Â– Page 10  geographic scope. If and to the extent a court of competent jurisdiction or
an arbitrator, as the case may be, determines that any of the restrictions
or covenants set forth in this Agreement are unreasonable, then it is the
intention of the parties that such restrictions be enforced to the fullest
extent that such court or arbitrator deems reasonable and that this Agreement
shall be reformed to the extent necessary to permit such enforcement.

5.8 Remedies. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Executive of
the provisions of Section 5 hereof, Executive agrees that the Company shall
be entitled to a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction
(without the necessity of posting bond in connection therewith) and that any
additional payments or benefits due to Executive or his dependents under
Sections 3 and 4 hereof may be suspended, canceled, or forfeited, in the sole
discretion of the Company. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting
the Company from pursuing any other remedy available to it for such breach or
threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from Executive.



   6. | Miscellaneous: 
---|--- 

6.1 Mitigation Not Required. As a condition of any payment hereunder,
Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of such payment by
seeking other employment or otherwise, nor will any profits, income, earnings
or other benefits from any source whatsoever create any mitigation, offset,
reduction or any other obligation on the part of Executive under this
Agreement.

6.2 Enforcement of This Agreement. In addition to the CompanyÂ’s equitable
remedies provided under Section 5.8 hereof, which need not be exclusively
resolved by arbitration, in the event that any legal dispute arises in
connection with, relating to, or concerning this Agreement, or in the event
of any claim for breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement,
Executive agrees that such dispute or claim will be resolved by arbitration.
Any such arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the
Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Any such dispute or claim will be presented
to a single arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of the Executive and the
Company (or the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the rules of
the AAA). All determinations of the arbitrator will be final and biding upon
the Executive and the Company. Each party to the arbitration proceeding will
bear its own costs in connection with such arbitration proceedings, except
that the costs and expenses of the arbitrator will be divided evenly between
the parties. The venue for any arbitration proceeding and for any judicial
proceeding related to this arbitration provision (including a judicial
proceeding to enforce this provision) will be in Tupelo, Mississippi.

6.3 AttorneysÂ’ Fees. In the event any dispute in connection with this
Agreement arises with respect to obligations of Executive or the Company that
were required prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control, all costs, fees
and expenses, including attorneysÂ’ fees, of any litigation, arbitration or
other legal action in connection with such matters in which Executive
substantially prevails, shall be borne by, and be the obligation of, the
Company.

After a Change in Control has occurred, Executive shall not be required to
incur legal fees and the related expenses associated with the
interpretation, enforcement or defense of ExecutiveÂ’s rights under this
Agreement by arbitration, litigation or otherwise. Accordingly, if following a
Change in Control, the Company has failed to comply with any of its
obligations under this Agreement or the Company or any other person takes or
threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable
or in any way reduce the possibility of collecting the amounts due hereunder,
or institutes any litigation or other action or proceeding designed to deny
or to recover from Executive the benefits provided or intended to be provided
under this Agreement, Executive shall be entitled to retain counsel of
ExecutiveÂ’s choice, at the expense of the Company, to advise and represent
Executive in connection with any such  



 

Schedule 5.20-E Â– Page 11  interpretation, enforcement or defense, including without limitation the
initiation or defense of any litigation, arbitration or other legal action,
whether by or against the Company or any director, officer, stockholder or
other person affiliated with the Company, in any jurisdiction. The Company
shall pay and be solely financially responsible for any and all attorneysÂ’ and
related fees and expenses incurred by Executive in connection with any of the
foregoing, without regard to whether Executive prevails, in whole or in part.

In no event shall Executive be required to reimburse the Company for any of
the costs and expenses incurred by the Company relating to arbitration,
litigation or other legal action in connection with this Agreement.

6.4 No Set-Off. There shall be no right of set-off or counterclaim in respect
of any claim, debt or obligation against any payment to Executive provided
for in this Agreement.

6.5 Assistance with Litigation. For a period of two years after the
Termination Date, Executive will furnish such information and proper
assistance as may be reasonably necessary in connection with any litigation in
which the Company (or an Affiliate) is then or may become involved, without
the payment of a fee or charge, except reimbursement of his direct expenses.

6.6 Headings. Section and other headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

6.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the final and complete
understanding and agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and there are no other agreements, understandings,
restrictions, representations or warranties among the parties other than those
set forth herein. Executive acknowledges that this Agreement replaces in
their entirety any prior agreements between Executive and the Company or its
Affiliates concerning the subject covered by this Agreement, including the
Prior Agreement.

 

6.8 Amendments. Except as provided in Section 5.7 hereof, this Agreement may
be amended or modified at any time in any or all respects, but only by an
instrument in writing executed by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may amend this Agreement to the extent it deems
necessary or appropriate to ensure that any payment hereunder shall not be
subject to income inclusion under Section 409A of the Code prior the date on
which such amount is otherwise payable hereunder. The Company shall promptly
provide to Executive written notice of any such amendment.

6.9 Choice of Law. The validity of this Agreement, the construction of its
terms, and the determination of the rights and duties of the parties hereto
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the
State of Mississippi applicable to contracts made to be performed wholly
within such state, without regard to the choice of law provisions thereof.

6.10 Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement must
be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered
by hand, (b) sent by facsimile to a facsimile number given below, provided
that a copy is sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service

severable. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained

unenforceable, the same shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no provision shall be severed if it is
clearly apparent under the circumstances that the parties would not have
entered into this Agreement without such provision.

6.13 Withholding; Taxes. Executive shall be responsible for the payment of any
