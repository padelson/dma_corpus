-v- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER



THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated as of June 14,
2004, is by and between Fulton Financial Corporation, a Pennsylvania
corporation ("Parent"), and First Washington FinancialCorp, a New Jersey
corporation (the "Company"). Parent and the Company are sometimes collectively
referred to herein as the "Constituent Corporations". Defined terms are
described in Section 9.11.



RECITALS



A. Parent desires to acquire the Company and the Companys Board of Directors
has determined, based upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth,
that the acquisition is in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders. The acquisition will be accomplished by (i) merging the Company
with and into Parent with Parent as the surviving corporation (the "Merger")
and (ii) the Companys shareholders receiving the Aggregate Merger
Consideration hereinafter set forth. The Boards of Directors of each of the
Company and Parent have duly adopted and approved this Agreement and the Board
of Directors of the Company has directed that it be submitted to the Companys
shareholders for approval.

 



B. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.



C. In connection with the execution of this Agreement, the parties are to
enter into a Warrant Agreement in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_
 attached hereto (the "Warrant Agreement"), which provides for the delivery
by the Company of a warrant in substantially the form of _Exhibit B_ attached
hereto (the "Warrant") entitling Parent to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock in certain circumstances. In addition, the Company has obtained voting
agreements in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto, from the directors and
executive officers listed on _Exhibit C_ , who have agreed to vote shares of
voting capital stock beneficially owned by them in the Company in favor of
this Agreement, the Merger and, to the extent required, all transactions
incident thereto (collectively, the "Voting Agreements"). 



_NOW, THEREFORE_ , in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:



ARTICLE I. THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the New Jersey Business Corporation Act (the "BCA") and the
Pennsylvania Business Corporation Act of 1988, as amended (the "BCL"), at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), the Company shall merge
with and into Parent. Parent shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter
sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. The name of the Surviving  



 

1  Corporation shall continue to be Fulton Financial Corporation. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company
shall terminate.



1.2 _Closing, Closing Date, Determination Date and Effective Time_. Unless a
different date, time and/or place are agreed to by the parties hereto, the
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., at the
offices of Barley, Snyder, Senft and Cohen, LLC, 126 East King Street,
Lancaster, Pennsylvania 17602, on a date determined by Parent on at least five
business days notice (the "Closing Notice") given to the Company, which date
(the "Closing Date") shall be not more than twenty (20) business days
following the receipt of all necessary regulatory, governmental and
shareholder approvals and consents and the expiration of all statutory waiting
periods in respect thereof and the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to the consummation of the Merger specified in Article VII hereof
(other than the delivery of certificates, opinions and other instruments and
documents to be delivered at the Closing); provided, however, that Parent may
defer the Closing Date to a date no later than January 31, 2005 (assuming the
Determination Date would require a Closing Date before such date) to provide
for adequate due diligence in connection with Parents "internal
control report" obligations under Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. In the
Closing Notice, Parent shall specify the "Determination Date", which date
shall be the first date on which all bank regulatory approvals (and waivers,
if applicable) necessary for consummation of the Merger have been received
(disregarding any waiting period) and either party has notified the other in
writing that all such approvals (and waivers, if applicable) have been
received. Simultaneous with or immediately following the Closing, Parent and
the Company shall cause to be filed (i) a certificate of merger, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company and consistent
with the terms of this Agreement, with the Department of the Treasury of the
State of New Jersey (the "Certificate of Merger") and (ii) articles of merger,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company and
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, with the Department of State of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Articles of Merger"). The Certificate
of Merger and Articles of Merger shall specify the "Effective Time" of the
Merger, which Effective Time shall be a date and time following the Closing
agreed to by Parent and the Company (which date and time the parties currently
anticipate will be 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date). In the event the parties
fail to specify the date and time in the Certificate of Merger and Articles
of Merger, the Merger shall become effective upon (and the "Effective Time"
shall be) the time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger and the Articles
of Merger.



1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall be considered the same business and corporate entity as each of Parent
and the Company and, thereupon and thereafter, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of each of Parent and the Company shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall be subject
to and be deemed to have assumed all of the debts, liabilities, obligations
and duties of each of Parent and the Company and shall have succeeded to all
of each of their relationships, as fully and to the same extent as if such
property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises, debts, liabilities,
obligations, duties and relationships had been originally acquired, incurred
or entered into by the Surviving Corporation. In addition, any reference to
either of Parent and the Company in any  



 

-2-  contract or document, whether executed or taking effect before or after the
Effective Time, shall be considered a reference to the Surviving Corporation
if not inconsistent with the other provisions of the contract or document;
and any pending action or other judicial proceeding to which either of Parent
or the Company is a party shall not be deemed to have abated or to have
discontinued by reason of the Merger, but may be prosecuted to final
judgment, order or decree in the same manner as if the Merger had not been
made; or the Surviving Corporation may be substituted as a party to such
action or proceeding, and any judgment, order or decree may be rendered for
or against it that might have been rendered for or against either of Parent or
the Company if the Merger had not occurred.



1.4 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.



(a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this Section 1.4
and Section 2.2(e), each share of the Companys common stock, no par value
per share ("Company Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock held in
the Companys treasury and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held directly
or indirectly by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(as defined below) (except for Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such
terms are defined in Section 1.4(b) hereof), shall by virtue of this
Agreement and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or the
holder thereof, cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and become
the right to receive 1.35 shares of common stock, $2.50 par value, of
Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), together with the number of Parent Rights (as
defined in Section 4.2) associated therewith (such shares, the "Per Share
Stock Consideration" and the ratio of such number to one, the "Exchange
Ratio").



(b) At the Effective Time, (i) all shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned by the Company as treasury stock and (ii) all shares of Company Common
Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries (other than shares of Company Common Stock (x)
held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like
or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of third parties or
any shares held in any employee plan disclosed on Section 3.11 of the
Disclosure Schedule (any such shares, and shares of Parent Common Stock which
are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account
Shares") and (y) held by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such shares of
Company Common Stock, and shares of Parent Common Stock which are similarly
held, being referred to herein as "DPC Shares")), shall be canceled and shall
cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Parent Common Stock that are
owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account
Shares and DPC Shares) shall become treasury stock of Parent.



(c) On and after the Effective Time, holders of certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (the "Certificates") shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of
the  



 

-3-  Company, except the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration for
each such share held by them. The consideration which any holder of Company
Common Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article I is referred to
herein as the "Merger Consideration". The consideration which all of the
Company shareholders are entitled to receive pursuant to this Article I is
referred to herein as the "Aggregate Merger Consideration".



(d) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if, between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or readjustment, or a stock dividend declared thereon with a record date
within said period, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Exchange
Ratio. 



1.5 _Exchange Agent_. The Company and Parent hereby appoint Fulton Financial
Advisors, National Association (or such other transfer agent as Parent shall
designate in good faith) as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for
purposes of effecting the conversion of Company Common Stock hereunder.



1.6 _Stock Options_. All options which may be exercised for issuance of
Company Common Stock (whether or not vested) (each, a "Company Stock Option"
and collectively the "Company Stock Options") are described in the Company
Disclosure Schedule and are issued and outstanding pursuant to the Companys
Amended and Restated 1997 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Stock Option Plan and 2003
Stock Option Plan (each, a "Company Stock Option Plan" and collectively,
the "Company Stock Option Plans") and the agreements pursuant to which such
Company Stock Options were granted (each, an "Option Grant Agreement"). True
and complete copies of the Company Stock Option Plans and all Option Grant
Agreements relating to outstanding Company Stock Options have been delivered
to Parent. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that (i) is
outstanding at the Effective Time, and (ii) would otherwise survive the
Effective Time in the absence of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ("Old Stock Options"), shall be assumed by Parent through the grant
of an option to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock on the terms set forth
below (each Old Stock Option, as assumed, a "Parent Stock Option"). All Old
Stock Options shall automatically be converted as of the Effective Time, into
Parent New Options which shall be identical to the Old Stock Options in all
material respects, except that (i) upon exercise of the Parent Options, the
optionholder will receive Parent Common Stock rather than Company Common
Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock covered by each Parent
Option shall equal the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by
the corresponding Old Stock Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, (iii) the
exercise price of each Parent Option shall equal the exercise price applicable
to the corresponding Old Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio and (iv)
the committee that administers the plan by which such Parent Options are
governed shall be a committee established by the Board of Directors of Parent.
In all other material respects, the Parent Options shall be governed by the
terms of the Company Stock Option Plan at and after the Effective Time.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to register the shares issuable upon exercise of the Parent Options  



 

-4-  under the Securities Act of 1933, and to keep such registration in effect
until such time as all New Stock Options have been exercised. In connection
with the foregoing, (i) the foregoing is intended to effect an assumption of
the Old Stock Options by Parent under Section 424(a) of the Code and (ii)
neither a Parent Stock Option nor the assumption of Old Stock Option shall
give the holder of an Old Stock Option additional benefits which he did not
have under such an Old Stock Option within the meaning of Section 424(a)(1) of
the Code. Subject to issuance of the Parent Stock Options and the foregoing,
the Company Stock Option Plans and all options or other rights to acquire
Company Common Stock issued thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time.
Parent shall not issue or pay for any fractional shares otherwise issuable
upon exercise of a Parent Stock Option. Prior to the Effective Time (to the
extent required as determined by Parent or the Company under applicable law,
the terms of the Company Stock Option Plans or otherwise), Parent shall
receive agreements from each holder of an Old Stock Option that does
not elect to exercise such Old Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and have the Company Common Stock acquired as a result of such
exercise converted into Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1 of this
Agreement, pursuant to which each such holder agrees to accept a Parent Stock
Option in substitution for the Old Stock Option, as of the Effective Time.



1.7 _Parent Common Stock_. Except for shares of Parent Common Stock owned by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and
DPC Shares), which shall be converted into treasury stock of Parent as
contemplated by Section 1.4, the shares of Parent Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by the
Merger and such shares shall remain issued and outstanding. The holders of
the shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, immediately after the Effective Time, continue to hold a
majority of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock.



1.8 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of Parent, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.



1.9 _By-Laws_. At the Effective Time, the By-Laws of Parent, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.



1.10 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. Parent shall, on or
promptly after the Effective Time (but no later than Parents next Board of
Directors meeting following the Effective Time), appoint to Parents Board of
Directors Abraham Opatut (or one of the Companys other current directors
designated, subject to the reasonable approval of Parent, by vote of the
Companys Board of Directors prior to the Effective Date) to serve as a
director of Parent. Such director shall stand for election at Parents 2005
annual meeting, at which  



 

-5-  time, subject to the exercise by Parents Board of Directors of its
fiduciary duties, Parent shall nominate and recommend for election such
director for an additional term of three (3) years. Parent has a mandatory
retirement policy for directors who attain age 70; however, Parent would
"grandfather" the present director of the Company appointed as set forth above
from the application of such policy for a three year period after the
Effective Date unless such director would have otherwise been obligated to
retire from the Board of the Company under any policy it currently has in
effect. The officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified.



1.11 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a

368 of the Code.



1.12 _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold,
or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from funds provided by the
holder or from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Company Common Stock, the minimum amounts (if any) that
Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of Tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent.



1.13 _No Right of Dissent_. Pursuant to Section 14A:11-1(1)(a)(i)(B) of the
New Jersey Business Corporation Act, the shareholders of the Company shall
not be entitled to exercise dissenters rights.



ARTICLE II. EXCHANGE OF SHARES



2.1  _Parent to Deposit Shares_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with
this Article II, certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in
an amount sufficient to cover the Aggregate Merger Consideration (such
certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.



 

-6- 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.



(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.
The Company shall have the right to review both the letter of transmittal and
the instructions prior to the Effective Time and provide reasonable comments
thereon. After the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to which such holder
of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions
of Article I, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash constituting Merger
Consideration (including cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares) or on
any unpaid dividends or distributions, if any, payable to holders of
Certificates.



(b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder
thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II.
After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II,
the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had
become payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock, if any,
represented by such Certificate. 



(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall
pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Parent Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.



(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
Merger Consideration as determined in accordance with Article I and this
Article II.



 

-7- (e) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection
with the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional share to which he
would otherwise be entitled, each former shareholder of the Company shall
receive in cash an amount equal to the fair market value of his fractional
interest, which fair market value shall be determined by multiplying such
fraction by the Closing Market Price. For purposes of this Agreement, the
"Closing Market Price" shall be the average of the per share closing price for
Parent Common Stock, calculated to two decimal places, for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date which is two (2)
business days before the Effective Time, as reported on the National Market
System of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
System ("NASDAQ"), the foregoing period of ten (10) trading days being
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Price Determination Period." (For
example, if January 14, 2005 were to be the Effective Date, then the Price
Determination Period would be December 30 and 31, 2004 and January 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 10, 11 and 12, 2005). In the event that NASDAQ shall fail to report a
closing price for Parent Common Stock for any trading day during the Price
Determination Period, the closing price for that day shall be equal to the
average of the closing bid and asked prices as quoted: (i) by F. J. Morrissey
and Company, Inc. and by Ryan, Beck and Co.; or (ii) in the event that both
of these firms are not then making a market in Parent Common Stock, by two
brokerage firms then making a market in Parent Common Stock to be selected by
Parent and approved by the Company.



(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of the shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and
unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates are not surrendered or the
payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such payments would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or
agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property laws, escheat laws and any other applicable law, become the property
of Parent (and to the extent not in its possession shall be paid over to it),
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled to
such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash and/or shares of Parent Common Stock
 



 

-8-  and cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

disclosure schedules required by this Article III, dated as of the date hereof
and referenced to the specific sections and subsections of Article III of this
Agreement, which have been delivered on the date hereof by the Company to
Parent. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey. The Company has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). The Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of the Company, copies of which have previously been made available to
Parents counsel, are true and correct copies of such documents as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term
"Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole, other than any such effect attributable to or resulting from (x) any
change in banking or similar laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability or interpretations thereof by courts or governmental
authorities, (y) any change in generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") or regulatory accounting principles applicable to commercial banks
or their holding companies generally or (z) any action or omission of the
Company or Parent or any Subsidiary of either of them taken with the prior
written consent of Parent (in the case of acts or omissions of the Company
and its Subsidiaries) or the Company (in the case of acts or omissions of
Parent and its Subsidiaries) or (ii) the ability of such party and its
Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.



(b) Company Bank is a state-chartered, non-member commercial banking
corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of

required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when due. Each of
the Companys other Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries has  



 

-9-  the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is
duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or the location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary. The certificate of incorporation, by-laws and
similar governing documents of each Subsidiary of the Company, copies of which
have previously been made available to Parents counsel, are true and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.



(c) The minute books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries contain true

indirectly, any equity interest in any corporation, company, association,

Home Loan Bank of New York and shares held by the Company Bank in a fiduciary
or custodial capacity in the normal course of its business (which, except as
disclosed in Section 3.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, do not in the
aggregate constitute more than 5% of the voting shares or interests in any
such corporation, company, association, partnership, joint ventures or other
entity) and except that which the Company Bank holds pursuant to satisfaction
of obligations due to the Company Bank and which are disclosed in Section
3.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company and its Subsidiaries
own no real estate, except real estate used for their banking premises or
acquired pursuant to satisfaction of obligations due to the Company Bank. All
such real estate is listed on Section 3.1(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.



3.2 _Capitalization_.

and outstanding Company Bank Shares have been duly authorized and validly
issued and all such shares are fully paid and nonassessable. As of the date
hereof, there are no outstanding options, warrants, commitments or other
rights or instruments to purchase or acquire any shares of capital stock of
Company Bank, or any securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for

or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock
of each of such Subsidiaries, free and clear of all liens, charges,
encumbrances and security interests whatsoever, and all of such shares are
duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free
of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. No Subsidiary of the Company has or is bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock
or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing
the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any
other equity security of such Subsidiary. Assuming compliance by Parent with
Section 1.6, at the Effective Time, there will not be any outstanding

in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or
other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or partially out of events
occurring prior to the Effective Time.

authorize or permit any of their officers, directors or employees or any
investment banker, financial advisor or attorney to initiate or encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information), or take any other
action to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, provided, however, that if, at any time the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to  



 

-41-  do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law, the Company, in response to a written
Acquisition Proposal that (i) was unsolicited or that did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section, and (ii) is reasonably likely to lead to
a Superior Proposal, may (x) furnish non-public information with respect to
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to the person who made such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement and (y)
participate in negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any director or officer of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant, or other representative of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, whether or not acting on behalf
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section by the Company.



(b) The Company shall call a meeting of its shareholders to be held as
promptly as practicable for the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and
shall take, in good faith, all actions which are necessary or appropriate on
its part in order to secure the approval of this Agreement by its shareholders

Companys shareholders; provided, however, that the Companys Board of
Directors shall not be required to take any action otherwise required by this
sentence that it has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law.



(c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (1) fail to recommend this
Agreement, withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the
Merger unless there is an Acquisition Proposal outstanding, (2) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or
(3) cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal unless (x) the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law and (y) the applicable Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal.



(d) Nothing contained in this Section shall prohibit the Company from at any
time taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act, as amended, provided, however, that
neither the Company nor its Board of Directors shall, except as permitted by
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, propose to approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal.



(e) The Company shall promptly (but in any event within one day) advise Parent
orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry regarding
the making of an Acquisition Proposal including any request for information,
the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry and the identity of the person making such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company will, to  



 

-42-  the extent reasonably practicable, keep Parent fully informed of the status
and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.



(i) In the event the Board of Directors of the Company takes any of the
actions set forth in clauses (1), (2) and/or (3) of Section 5.3(c) in
compliance with the standards in (x) and (y) therein, such action shall allow
termination of this Agreement by Parent under Section 8.1(g) herein which
shall be treated in the same manner as termination under Section 8.1(e) herein
and shall allow exercise of the Warrant. In the event the Board of Directors
of the Company takes any of the actions set forth in clauses (1), (2) and/or
(3) of Section 5.3(c) without compliance with the standards in (x) and (y)
therein, such action shall constitute a breach allowing termination of this
Agreement by Parent under Section 8.1(g) herein which shall be treated in the
same manner as termination by Parent under Section 8.1(e) herein and shall
allow exercise of the Warrant.



(ii) This Agreement may be terminated by the Company prior to the shareholders
meeting of the Company if (A) the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel that
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable law, (B) it
is not in breach of its obligations under this Section 5.3 in any material
respect and has complied with, and continues to comply with, all requirements
and procedures of this Section 5.3 in all material respects and the Board of
Directors of the Company has authorized, subject to complying with the terms
of this Agreement, the Company to enter into a binding written agreement for a
transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company notifies
Parent in writing that it intends to enter into such agreement, attaching the
most current version of such agreement to such notice; (C) Parent does not
make, within five (5) business days after receipt of the Companys written
notice of its intention to enter into a binding agreement for a Superior
Proposal, any offer that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably and
in good faith determines, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, is at least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as the
Superior Proposal and during such period the Company reasonably considers and
discusses in good faith all proposals submitted by Parent and, without
limiting the foregoing, meets with, and causes its financial and legal
advisors to meet with, Parent and its advisors from time to time as required
by Parent to consider and discuss in good faith Parents proposals, and (D)
prior to the Companys termination pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)(ii), the
Company confirms in writing that such termination allows exercise of the
Warrant. The Company agrees (x) that it will not enter into a binding
agreement referred to in clause (B) above until at least the five (5) business
days after Parent has received the notice to Parent required by clause (C)
and (y) to notify Parent promptly if its intention to enter into a binding
agreement referred to in its notice to Parent shall change at any time after
giving such notice.



 

-43- (f) For the purpose of this Section 5.3:



(i) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean a written proposal or written offer
(other than by another party hereto) for a tender or exchange offer for
securities of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or a merger,
consolidation or other business combination involving an acquisition of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any proposal to acquire in any
manner a substantial equity interest in or a substantial portion of the assets
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.



(ii) A "Superior Proposal" shall be an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company believes in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
Acquisition Proposal and the source of its financing, on the terms proposed
and, believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor),
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the
shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view, than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and believes in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor) that the person making such
Acquisition Proposal has, or is reasonably likely to have or obtain, any
necessary funds or customary commitments to provide any funds necessary to
consummate such Acquisition Proposal.

(or predecessor employers to the extent that the Company provides past
service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent without application of
any preexisting condition limitations. Each Parent Benefit Plan shall waive
pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan.



 

-47- (c) With regard to those certain employees listed in Section 6.6(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule hereto, the Parent agrees to provide insurance benefits
at the same deductible, contribution and co-payment levels as such employees
received prior to the Effective Time.



6.7 _Indemnification_.



 

(a) For a period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending six years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each person who is now, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director
or officer of the Company or the Company Bank or who serves or has served at
the request of the Company or the Company Bank as a director or officer
with any other person (collectively, the "Indemnitees") against any and all
claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, charges, expenses (including,
subject to the provisions of this Section 6.7, reasonable costs of
investigation and the reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel and
other advisers and experts as incurred), judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement, asserted against, incurred by or imposed upon any
Indemnitee by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Company or serves or has served at the request of the Company
as a director or officer with any other person, in connection with, arising
out of or relating to (i) any threatened, pending or completed claim, action,
suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
including, without limitation, any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings
or investigations by or on behalf of or in the right of or against
the Company or any of its affiliates, or by any former or present shareholder
of the Company (each a "Claim" and collectively, "Claims"), including, without
limitation, any Claim which is based upon, arises out of or in any way
relates to the Merger, the Proxy Statement, this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Indemnitees service as a
member of the Board of Directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of any
committee thereof, the events leading up to the execution of this Agreement,
any statement, recommendation or solicitation made in connection therewith or
related thereto and any breach of any duty in connection with any of the
foregoing, or (ii) the enforcement of the obligations of Parent set forth in
this Section 6.7, in each case to the fullest extent which the Company would
have been permitted under any applicable law and its Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws had the Merger not occurred (and Parent shall also
advance expenses as incurred due to (i) or (ii) above to the fullest extent so
permitted). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not provide any
indemnification or advance any expenses with respect to any Claim which
relates to a personal benefit improperly paid or provided, or alleged to have
been improperly paid or provided, to the Indemnitee, but Parent shall
reimburse the Indemnitee for costs incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to
such Claim when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final and nonappealable,
that the Indemnitee was not improperly paid or provided with the personal
benefit alleged in the Claim. 



Any Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.7 shall
promptly notify Parent upon learning of any Claim, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may have to such
Indemnitee except to the extent that  



 

-48-  such failure prejudices Parent. In the event of any Claim as to which
indemnification under this Section 6.7 is applicable, (x) Parent shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be liable to
such Indemnitees for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof, except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense, or counsel
for the Indemnitees advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent and the Indemnitees, the Indemnitees may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnitees as statements therefor are
received; provided, however, that Parent shall be obligated pursuant to this
Section 6.7 to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnitees in
any jurisdiction with respect to a matter unless the use of one counsel for
multiple Indemnitees would present such counsel with a conflict of interest
that is not waived, and (y) the Indemnitees will cooperate in the defense of
any such matter. Parent shall not be liable for the settlement of any claim,
action or proceeding hereunder unless such settlement is effected with its
prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.7, Parent shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee
when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that the
indemnification of such Indemnitee in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable law or public policy.



(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Date, Parent shall (and the Company
shall cooperate in these efforts) obtain and maintain "tail" coverage relating
to the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy
(provided that such insurance shall be in such amount and with terms and
conditions no less favorable than the director and officer liability policy of
the Company as of the date of this Agreement and carry such premium (not to
exceed the greater of (i) 150% of the current premium for Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance policy or (ii) the applicable
percentage increase payable by Parent during such period for its directors and
officers liability insurance policy) and that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are substantially no less advantageous) with respect to
claims arising from facts or circumstances which occur prior to the Effective
Time (including facts or circumstances relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein to the extent coverage therefor is available)
and covering persons who are covered by such insurance immediately prior to
the Effective Time.



(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. 



(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.



 

-49- 6.8 _Additional Arrangements_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation considers or is advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of each of the Constituent
Corporations or otherwise, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of the
Constituent Corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as
may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.



6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each party shall give prompt notice to
the others of (a) any event, condition, change, occurrence, act or omission
which causes any of its representations hereunder to cease to be true in all
material respects (or, with respect to any such representation which is
qualified as to materiality, causes such representation to cease to be true in
all respects); and (b) any event, condition, change, occurrence, act or
omission which individually or in the aggregate has, or which, so far as
reasonably can be foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is reasonably likely
to have, a Material Adverse Effect on such party. Each of the Company and the
Parent shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or other
communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third
party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.



6.10  _Certain Matters, Certain Revaluations, Changes and Adjustments_.
Notwithstanding that the Company believes that it and its Subsidiaries have
established all reserves and taken all provisions for possible loan losses
required by GAAP and applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Company
recognizes that Parent may have adopted different loan, accrual and reserve
policies (including loan classifications and levels of reserves for possible
loan losses). At or before the Effective Time, upon the request of Parent and
Parents written confirmation that all conditions precedent under Section 7.1
and 7.2 (other than the delivery of customary closing documents) have been
satisfied or waived, and in order to formulate the plan of integration for
the Merger, the Company shall, consistent with GAAP, modify and change its
loan, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including
loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied consistently
on a mutually satisfactory basis with those of Parent and establish such
accruals and reserves as shall be necessary to reflect Merger-related expenses
and costs incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries, provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required to take such action prior to receipt
of shareholder and regulatory approvals; and provided further, however, that
no accrual or reserve made by the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant
to this Section 6.10 or any litigation or regulatory proceeding arising out
of any such accrual or reserve, shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant,
condition or other provision of this Agreement or  



 

-50-  otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or
failure to satisfy shall have occurred.



6.11 _Other Policies_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to reasonably conform the
policies and procedures of the Company and its Subsidiaries regarding
applicable regulatory matters to those of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as
Parent may reasonably identify to the Company from time to time, provided,
however, that implementation of such conforming actions may at the Companys
discretion be delayed until the time period following satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.10. 



6.12 _Other Transactions_. The Company acknowledges that Parent may be in the
process of acquiring other banks and financial institutions or in offering
securities to the public and that in connection with such transactions,
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries may be required to be
included in the registration statements, if any, for the sale of securities of
Parent or in SEC reports in connection with such transactions. Parent shall
provide the Company and its counsel with copies of such registration
statements at the time of filing. The Company agrees to provide Parent with
any information, certificates, documents or other materials about the Company
and its Subsidiaries as are reasonably necessary to be included in such SEC
reports or registration statements, including registration statements which
may be filed by Parent prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause its attorneys and accountants to provide Parent
and any underwriters for Parent with any consents, comfort letters, opinion
letters, reports or information which are necessary to complete the
registration statements and applications for any such acquisition or issuance
of securities. Parent shall not file with the SEC any registration statement
or amendment thereto or supplement thereof containing information regarding
the Company unless the Company shall have consented in writing to such filing,
which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.



6.13 _Failure to Fulfill Conditions_. In the event that Parent or the Company
determines that a material condition to its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or prior to the Cut-
off Date (as defined in Section 8.1(c)) and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify the other party. The Company and Parent
will promptly inform the other of any facts applicable to the Company or
Parent, respectively, or their respective directors or officers or
Subsidiaries, that would be likely to prevent or materially delay approval of
the Merger by any Governmental Entity or which would otherwise prevent or
materially delay completion of the Merger. Any information so provided shall
be retained by the receiving party in accordance with the terms of the
confidentiality agreement heretofore executed by the parties hereto.



6.14 _Transaction Expenses of the Company_.



(a) The Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries professionals to render
monthly invoices within 30 days after the end of each month. The Company
shall advise Parent monthly of all out-of-pocket expenses which the Company
and its  



 

-51-  Subsidiaries have incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not
to, pay fees and expenses to its accountants or attorneys on any basis
different than the basis on which such professionals would be paid in the
absence of any business combination.



(b) The Company, in reasonable consultation with Parent and at Parents
expense, shall make all arrangements with respect to the printing and mailing
of the Proxy Statement.



6.15 _Pre-Closing Delivery of Financial Statements_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent such consolidated financial statements of the
Company as Parent shall reasonably request in order to enable Parent to
comply with its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, together with an
executed report of the Companys outside auditors with respect to all such
financial statements that have been audited. Such report shall be in form and
substance satisfactory to the Parent _._ The financial statements delivered
pursuant to this Section 6.16 shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and
shall conform to all provisions of the SECs Regulation S-X, such that such
financial statements are suitable for filing by the Parent with the SEC in
response to Items 2 and 7 of the SECs Current Report on Form 8-K _._
Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause its outside auditors
to deliver to the Parent an executed consent, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Parent and suitable for filing by the Parent with the SEC,
which consent shall authorize the Parent to file with the SEC the report
referred to in this Section 6.16 and all other reports delivered by the
Company hereunder.



6.16  _ISRA_. The Company, at its sole cost and expense, shall obtain, prior
to the Effective Time, either (i) a written determination (based upon an
affidavit from the Company that is approved by the Parent prior to its
submission to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
("NJDEP")) from the NJDEP that the transactions contemplated by, or the
properties subject to, this Agreement are not subject to the requirements of
ISRA, or (ii) a Remediation Agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to
Parent) issued by the NJDEP pursuant to ISRA authorizing the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the issuance of any
"Negative Declaration," "No Further Action Letter" or approval of any
"Remedial Action Workplan," as such terms are defined under ISRA, or (iii) a
"Negative Declaration" or approvals of any "Remedial Action Workplan"
(in either case in form and substance satisfactory to the Parent) with
respect to each property in New Jersey which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries owns or operates, in each case to the extent that such property
renders the provisions of ISRA applicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company will obtain and maintain a "Remediation Funding
Source" in form and amount approvable by the NJDEP as required in furtherance
of the Companys obligations under this covenant.



6.17 _Post-Closing Operation of the Company Bank_. After the Effective Time,
the Board of Directors of the Company Bank immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall continue to be the Board of Directors of the Company Bank
immediately after the Effective Time, the chairman of the board of the
Company Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the
chairman of the board of the Company Bank immediately after the Effective
Time, and the chief executive officer of the Company Bank immediately prior
to the  



 

-52-  Effective Time shall continue to be the chief executive officer of the
Company Bank immediately after the Effective Time. In addition, the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Company Bank as in existence
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of the Company Bank immediately after the
Effective Time. Subject to the next sentence, Parent, as shareholder, agrees
to vote in favor of the re-election of the Directors of the Company Bank for
three successive full one year terms at each of the next three annual meetings
of the shareholders of the Company Bank after the Effective Time, provided
that, in the event an individual Company Bank Director ceases to act as a
director or as a member of any committee thereof, the obligation provided for
below to maintain existing fees and benefits shall not apply to successors in
such positions and after such three-year period, each Company Bank shall be
subject to Parents mandatory retirement rules for directors and shall receive
the standard fee paid to directors of subsidiary banks of Parent. It
is intended that Parent will not terminate the separate corporate existence
of the Company Bank as a subsidiary of Parent for a period of three years
following the Effective Time (the "Transition Period"), unless required to do
so by law or governmental authorities, safe and sound banking practices, or
as a result of the fiduciary obligations of Parents Board of Directors.
During the Transition Period, each non-employee member of the Board of
Directors of the Company Bank shall continue to receive the same compensation
for service on the Board of Directors of the Company Bank as they received
prior to the Effective Time, the Chairman of the Board of the Company Bank
shall continue to receive the same compensation for such service as he
received prior to the Effective Time, and the Vice Chairman of the Board of
the Board of the Company Bank shall continue to receive the same compensation
for such service as he received prior to the Effective Time . Parent has
no present intention to remove any of the Company Banks directors or its
chairman of the board during the Transition Period, provided that the Company
Bank is managed in a manner consistent with Parents overall business
strategies, as such strategies may develop from time to time. However,
nothing herein shall be construed to limit the right of Parent to remove
and/or replace any or all of the officers of the Company Bank at any time
following the Effective Time, to amend the certificate of incorporation and
by-laws of the Company Bank at any time following the Effective Time or
otherwise to exercise the rights and prerogatives of Parent as a shareholder
of the Company Bank at any time following the Effective Time, except that the
Parent shall not terminate the separate corporate existence of the Company
Bank prior to the end of the Transition Period unless required to do so by law
or governmental authorities, safe and sound banking practices or as a result
of the fiduciary obligations of Parents Board of Directors and will not seek
to remove or fail to reelect any of the Directors of the Company Bank during
the Transition Period other than for cause or for conduct which harms the
business, regulatory status or reputation of the Company Bank, Parent or its
other Subsidiaries. For purposes hereof, "cause" shall mean a Directors
willful misconduct as a Director, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal
profit, or willful violation of any law, rule or regulation (other than
traffic violations or similar minor offenses). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Company Bank Directors, in their exercise of their
fiduciary duty as to the best interests of Company  



 

-53-  Bank and Parent, may, by a majority vote of such directors, modify or waive
any or all of the foregoing provisions in this Section 6.18.



6.18 _Tax Treatment_. Neither Parent nor the Company shall, or shall cause
any of their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action inconsistent with the
treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the
Code.



6.19 _Insurance Policies_. Parent shall pay the annual premiums on those
certain life insurance policies payable to the Directors of the Company Bank
and listed on Schedule 6.19 (the "Insurance Policies") for a period of five
(5) years from and after the Effective Time. For a period of thirty (30) days
following the fifth anniversary of the Effective Date, each such Director
shall have the option to purchase the policy applicable to him in exchange for
payment of the then current book value of such policy. In the event a director
does not exercise such option, the Company Bank shall remain the owner of the
applicable Insurance Policy and may take such action, including retention of
the Insurance Policy, as it deems appropriate, or surrender of the Insurance
Policy in exchange for the cash surrender value thereof. __ 



6.20 _Payment of Retention Bonuses_. Provided that each proposed recipient
remains an employee of the Company or the Company Bank from the date hereof
through the later of (a) the Effective Time or (b) a date, chosen by Parent,
not to exceed the earlier of thirty days after completion of data processing
conversion or six months after the Effective Time (the "Eligibility Date")
(provided that such recipient shall remain eligible if his or her employment
is terminated prior thereto without cause), the Company shall pay to each
individual employee listed on Section 6.20 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
hereof the bonus compensation provided for such employee on such schedule on
the earlier of (i) termination of such employees employment by Company Bank
or (ii) the Eligibility Date.



6.21 _Employee Severance_. From and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent,
Company or another subsidiary of Parent (any such parties employing employees
of Company or a Company Subsidiary, the "Parent Employers") shall: (A) satisfy
the Employment Agreement, and (B) use its good faith efforts to retain each
present employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in such
employees current position and salary compensation (or, if offered to, and
accepted by, an employee, a position for which the employee is qualified with
the Parent Employers at a compensation commensurate with the position), (ii)
in the event that the Parent Employers shall continue to employ officers or
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time, the Parent Employers shall employ such persons on the Effective Time
(other than the Contract Employee) as "at-will" employees, and (iii) in the
event the Parent Employers are not willing to employ, or terminate the
employment (other than for cause as defined in the Companys severance policy)
of, any officers or employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
(other than the Contract Employee), the Parent Employers shall pay severance
benefits to such employees (other than to the Contract Employee) as follows:
(A) in the event employment is terminated on or prior to the date which is one
year after the Effective Date the amount provided for in the
Companys severance policy included in the  



 

-54-  Disclosure Schedule; or (B) in the event employment is terminated
thereafter, in accordance with the then existing severance policy of Parent or
its successor.



ARTICLE VII. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

 



7.1 _Conditions to Each Party s Obligations Under this Agreement_. The
respective obligations of each party under this Agreement to consummate the
Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction, or, where permissible under
applicable law, waiver at or prior to the Effective Time of the
following conditions:



(a) _Approval of Shareholders; SEC Registration; Blue Sky Laws_. This
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been approved by
the requisite vote of the shareholders of the Company. The S-4 shall have been
declared effective by the SEC and shall not be subject to a stop order or any
threatened stop order, and the issuance of the Parent Common Stock shall have
been qualified in every state where such qualification is required under the
applicable state securities laws.

 



(b) _Regulatory Filings_. All necessary approvals and consents (including
without limitation any required approval of the Department of Banking and
Insurance of the State of New Jersey, the FRB, the SEC and (if necessary) the
Department of Environmental Protection of the State of New Jersey) of
Governmental Entities required to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby shall have been obtained without the imposition of any term or
condition which would, in Parents reasonable judgment, impair, in any
material respect, the value of the Merger to Parent. All conditions required
to be satisfied prior to the Effective Time by the terms of such approvals and
consents shall have been satisfied; and all statutory waiting periods in
respect thereof shall have expired. 



(c) _Suits and Proceedings_. No order, judgment or decree shall be
outstanding against a party hereto or a third party that would have the effect
of preventing completion of the Merger; no suit, action or other proceeding
shall be pending or threatened by any Governmental Entity seeking to restrain
or prohibit the Merger; and no suit, action or other proceeding shall be
pending before any court or Governmental Entity seeking to restrain or
prohibit the Merger or obtain other substantial monetary or other relief
against one or more parties hereto in connection with this Agreement and
which Parent or the Company determines in good faith, based upon the advice of
their respective counsel, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Merger
because any such suit, action or proceeding has a significant potential to be
resolved in such a way as to deprive the party electing not to proceed of any
of the material benefits to it of the Merger.



(d) _Tax Opinion_. Parent and Company shall each have received an opinion,
dated as of the Effective Time, of Barley, Snyder, Senft and Cohen, LLC,
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company and its counsel
and to Parent, based upon representation letters reasonably required by such
counsel, dated on or about the date of such opinion, and such other facts,
representations and customary limitations as such counsel may reasonably deem
relevant, to the effect that: (i) the  



 

-55-  Merger will be treated for federal income Tax purposes as a reorganization
qualifying under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code; (ii) no gain
or loss shall be recognized upon the exchange of Company Common Stock solely
for Parent Common Stock; (iii) with respect to cash received in exchange for
Company Common Stock, gain, if any, realized by the recipient on the exchange
shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the amount of such
cash; (iv) with respect to Parent Common Stock received in exchange for
Company Common Stock which was held as a capital asset on the date of the
exchange, such gain shall be treated as capital gain (long-term or short-
term, depending on the shareholders respective holding periods for their
Company Common Stock), except in the case of any such shareholder as to which
the exchange has the effect of a dividend within the meaning of Section
356(a)(2) of the Code; (v) the basis of any Parent Common Stock received in
exchange for Company Common Stock shall equal the basis of the recipients
Company Common Stock surrendered on the exchange, reduced by the amount of
cash received on the exchange, and increased by the amount of the gain
recognized, if any, on the exchange (whether characterized as dividend or
capital gain income); and (vi) the holding period for any Parent Common Stock
received in exchange for Company Common Stock will include the period during
which the Company Common Stock surrendered on the exchange was held, provided
such stock was held as a capital asset on the date of the exchange. In
connection therewith, each of Parent and the Company shall deliver to Barley,
Snyder, Senft and Cohen, LLC representation letters, in each case in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Barley, Snyder, Senft and Cohen, LLC .



(e) _Listing of Shares_. The shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be
issued to the shareholders of the Company upon consummation of the Merger
shall have been authorized for listing for quotation on the NASDAQ, subject to
official notice of issuance.



7.2 _Conditions to the Obligations of Parent Under this Agreement_. The
obligations of Parent under this Agreement shall be further subject to the
satisfaction or waiver, at or prior to the Effective Time, of the following
conditions:



(a) _Representations and Warranties; Performance of Obligations of the
Company_. Except for those representations and warranties which are made as
of a particular date, the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects
(except with respect to those representations and warranties which are
qualified as to materiality, which shall be true in all respects) on the
Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date. The representations
and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement which are made as
of a particular date shall be true and correct in all material respects
(except with respect to those representations and warranties which are
qualified as to materiality, which shall be true in all respects) as of
such date. The Company shall have performed in all material respects the
agreements, covenants and obligations to be performed by it prior to the
Closing Date.



 

-56- (b) _Certificates_. The Company shall have furnished Parent with
such certificates of its officers or other documents to evidence fulfillment
of the conditions set forth in this Section 7.2 as Parent may reasonably
request.



(c) _Accountant s Letter_. If requested by Parent, the Company shall have
caused to be delivered to the Parent "cold comfort" letters or letters of
procedures from the Companys independent certified public accountants, dated
(i) the date of the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Companys
shareholders and (ii) a date not earlier than five business days preceding
the date of the Closing and addressed to the Parent, concerning such matters
as are customarily covered in transactions of the type contemplated hereby;



(d) _Third Party Consents_. All consents, waivers and approvals of any third
parties (other than Governmental Entities) which are necessary to permit the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
shall have been obtained or made except for those the failure to obtain would
not have a Material Adverse Effect (i) on the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole or (ii) on the Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
None of the approvals or waivers referred to in this Section 7.2(d) shall
contain any term or condition which would have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to the Merger.



(e) _Opinion of Counsel for the Company_. Parent shall have received an
opinion, dated the Effective Time, from Windels, Marx, Lane and Mittendorf,
LLP, special counsel to the Company, in substantially the form of _Exhibit E_
hereto. In rendering any such opinion, such special counsel may require and,
to the extent they deem necessary or appropriate may rely upon, opinions of
other counsel and upon representations made in certificates of officers of the
Company, Parent, affiliates of the foregoing, and others.



(f) _Affiliate Agreements_. Shareholders of the Company who are or will be
affiliates of the Company or Parent for the purposes of the 1933 Act shall
have entered into agreements with Parent, in form and substance satisfactory
to Parent, reasonably necessary to assure compliance with Rule 145 under the
1933 Act.



(g) _Stock Options_. As may be required by Section 1.6 herein, all holders of
Stock Options who have not exercised such options shall have delivered
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent with respect to the assumption
by Parent of the Company Options as set forth in Section 1.6. 



(h) _No Material Adverse Change_. Parent (together with its accountants, if
the advice of such accountants is deemed necessary or desirable by Parent)
shall have established to its reasonable satisfaction that, since the date of
this Agreement, there shall not have been any material and adverse change in
the condition (financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities, business, results
of operations or future prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis taken as a whole. In particular, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing sentence, the financial statements of the  



 

-57-  Company shall indicate that the consolidated financial condition, assets,
liabilities and results of operations of Company as of the respective
dates reported therein do not vary adversely in any material respect from the
consolidated financial condition, assets, liabilities and results of
operations presented in the Company Financial Statements. For purposes of this
Section 7.2(h), a material and adverse change shall mean an event, change, or
occurrence which, individually or together with any other event, change, or
occurrence, has a Material Adverse Effect on (i) the financial position,
business, results of operations or future prospects of the Company or (ii)
the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement.



(i) _Employment Agreement_. The Employment Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect.



7.3 _Conditions to Obligations of the Company Under this Agreement._ The
obligation of the Company to effect the Merger is also subject to the
satisfaction or waiver by the Company at or prior to the Effective Time of the
following conditions:



(a) _Representations and Warranties; Performance of Obligations of Parent_.
Except for those representations and warranties which are made as of a
particular date, the representations and warranties of Parent contained in
this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects (except
with respect to those representations and warranties which are qualified as to
materiality, which shall be true in all respects) on the Closing Date as
though made on and as of the Closing Date. The representations and warranties
of Parent contained in this Agreement which are made as of a particular date
shall be true and correct in all material respects (except with respect to
those representations and warranties which are qualified as to materiality,
which shall be true in all respects) as of such date. Parent shall have
performed in all material respects the agreements, covenants and obligations
to be performed by it prior to the Closing Date.



(b) _Certificates_. Parent shall have furnished the Company with such
certificates of its officers or other documents to evidence fulfillment of
the conditions set forth in this Section 7.3 as the Company may reasonably
request.



(c) _Opinion of Counsel for Parent_. The Company shall have received an
opinion from Barley, Snyder, Senft and Cohen, LLC, counsel to Parent, dated the

representations made in certificates of officers of Parent, the Company,
affiliates of the foregoing, and others.



(d) _Parent Options_. Parent Stock Options shall have been substituted for the
Stock Options which have not been exercised pursuant to Section 1.6 herein.
Agreements evidencing the assumption of the Company Options pursuant to
Section 1.6 shall have been delivered.



 

-58- (e) _No Material Adverse Change_. The Company (together with its accountants,
if the advice of such accountants is deemed necessary or desirable by the
Company) shall have established to its reasonable satisfaction that, since the
date of this Agreement, there shall not have been any material and adverse
change in the condition (financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities,
business, or results of operations or future prospects of Parent. In
particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the
financial statements of Parent shall indicate that the consolidated financial
condition, assets, liabilities and results of operations of Parent as of the
respective dates reported therein do not vary adversely in any material
respect from the consolidated financial condition, assets, liabilities and
results of operations presented in the Parent Financial Statements. For
purposes of this Section 7.3(e), a material and adverse change shall mean an
event, change, or occurrence which, individually or together with any other
event, change, or occurrence, has a Material Adverse Effect on (i) the
financial position, business, results of operations or future prospects of
Parent or (ii) the ability of Parent to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.



(f) _Fairness Opinion_. The Company shall have obtained from Advest, Inc. or
from another independent financial advisor selected by the Board of Directors
of the Company, an opinion dated within five (5) days of the Proxy Statement
to be furnished to the Board of Directors of the Company stating that the
Conversion Ratio contemplated by this Agreement is fair to the shareholders of
the Company from a financial point of view.



ARTICLE VIII. TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT



8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the Company:



(a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent;



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company upon written notice to the other party (i)
60 days after the date on which any request or application for a required
regulatory approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or
recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such approval,
unless within the 60-day period following such denial or withdrawal
a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed with the
applicable Governmental Entity, provided, however, that no party shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i) if
such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein or (ii) if any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger;



(c) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before April 15, 2005 (the "Cut-off Date"), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of
the party seeking to terminate  



 

-59-  this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth herein;



(d) by either Parent or the Company if the approval of the shareholders of
the Company required for the consummation of the Merger shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held
meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; 



(e) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party (determined as of the date hereof or, in the case of
representations and warranties made as of a particular date, as of the date as
of which such representation or warranty is made), which breach is not cured
within thirty days following written notice to the party committing such
breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that neither party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) unless the breach of representation
or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party
receiving such representation not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby under the standards set forth in Section 7.2(a) (in the case of a
breach of representation or warranty by the Company) or the standards set
forth in Section 7.3(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty
by Parent);



(f) by either Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a material breach of any
of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party hereto, which breach shall not have been cured within thirty days
following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from
the other party hereto, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior
to the Closing;



(g) by Parent, if by Parents Board of Directors makes an election provided
for in Section 5.3(e)(i) herein;



(h) by the Company, if the Companys Board of Directors makes an election
provided for in, and subject to the conditions of, Section 5.3(e)(ii) herein;



(i) by Parent if the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 are not
satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the Cut-off Date;



(j) by the Company if the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 are not
satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the Cut-off Date; or



(A) (k)Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) below, the Company shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement, through a resolution adopted by
its Board of Directors, if the Closing Market Price is less than both (I)
$18.00 (the "Floor  



 

-60-  Price") and (II) the amount per share equal to (x) the Starting Price
multiplied by (y) .80 multiplied by (z) the quotient of the Average
NASDAQ Bank Index for the Price Determination Period (the numerator) over the
NASDAQ Bank Index on the Pre-Announcement Date (the denominator).



(B) In the event the conditions in (A) above allowing the Company to terminate
the Agreement are satisfied and the Company makes such election, Parent,
through a resolution adopted by its Board of Directors, shall have the option
to cause the Company to amend this Agreement (and, upon such amendment, the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement) to increase
the Exchange Ratio to a level, calculated to four decimal places, equal to
the Conversion Ratio multiplied by the quotient of the Floor Price (the
numerator) over the Closing Market Price (the denominator). For example, if
the Closing Market Price is $17.00 and the Floor Price is $18.00, Parent
would have the option to increase the Exchange Ratio to 1.4294 (1.35 x
18.00/$17.00) in lieu of terminating this Agreement.



(ii) For purposes of this Section 8.1(d),(A) "Pre-Announcement Date" shall
mean June 10, 2004, i.e., the trading day immediately preceding the date of
this Agreement, and (B) "Starting Price" shall mean $20.22, i.e., the last
sale price for Parent Common Stock on the Pre-Announcement Date as reported on
NASDAQ. 



(iii) The Starting Price, the Closing Market Price, the Floor Price and the
other amounts above shall be appropriately adjusted for an event described in
Section 1.4(d) herein.



8.2 _Effect of Termination_.



(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect except that (i) Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.5 and Article IX
shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) subject to Section
8.2(b), in the event that such termination is effected pursuant to
Sections 8.1(e) or 8.1(f), the non-defaulting party may pursue any remedy
available at law or in equity to enforce its rights and shall be paid by the
defaulting party for all damages, costs and expenses, including without
limitation legal, accounting, investment banking and printing expenses,
incurred or suffered by the non-defaulting party in connection herewith or in
the enforcement of its rights hereunder.



 

8.3 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of the
Company; provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by the Companys shareholders, there may not
be, without further approval of such  



 

-61-  shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or
changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to the
Companys shareholders hereunder other than as contemplated by this
Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.



8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the
parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or
failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.



ARTICLE IX. GENERAL PROVISIONS 



9.1 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or
Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this

terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be
deemed to refer to June 14, 2004. A matter shall be deemed to be within the
"knowledge" of an entity if such matter is within the actual knowledge of any
person who is as of the date hereof, or who becomes between the date hereof
and the Closing, an executive officer of such entity. No provision of this
Agreement shall be construed to require the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or affiliates to take any action that would violate
any applicable law, rule or regulation.



9.2 _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements_. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein
and therein which by their terms apply in whole or in part after the Effective
Time.

expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions

disclosure schedules and the instruments referred to herein), together with

to any applicable conflicts of law.



9.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid

ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.



9.9 _Publicity_. Except as otherwise required by law or the rules of NASDAQ,
so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither Parent nor the Company shall,
or shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of

this Agreement without the consent of the other party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.



9.10 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by
any party hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other party hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 6.7, this Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended
to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder.
