or the Seller Parties may provide written notice to the other that it elects
to submit the disputed items to a nationally recognized independent actuarial
firm chosen jointly by the Buyers and Parent, with respect to any disputes
regarding the Underfunded Amount, or a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm chosen jointly by the Buyers and Parent, with respect to all
other disputes (each, a " _Referee_ "); provided, that if such Referee is not
selected within three (3) Business Days following receipt of the written
notice electing to submit the disputed items to a Referee, the Referee with
respect to disputes regarding the Underfunded Amount shall be Mercer and the
Referee with respect to all other disputes shall be Ernst and Young. Not later
than ten (10) calendar days after the engagement of the Referee(s) (as
evidenced by its written acceptance to the parties, which acceptance shall
include a statement agreeing to render its decision within the time period(s)
set forth in this Section 2.5.5), the Seller Parties and the Buyers shall
submit simultaneous briefs to the Referee(s) (with a copy to the other party
or parties)

 



19  setting forth their respective positions regarding the matters raised in the
applicable Dispute Notice(s), and not later than ten (10) calendar days after
the submission of such briefs the Seller Parties and the Buyers shall submit
simultaneous reply briefs (with a copy to the other party or parties). Neither
the Seller Parties nor the Buyers will disclose to the Referee(s), and the
Referee(s) will not consider for any purpose, any settlement discussions or
settlement offer made by or on behalf of the Seller Parties or the Buyers,
unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Seller Parties and the Buyers. The
Seller Parties and the Buyers, shall instruct the Referee(s) to render its
decision resolving the matters raised in the Dispute Notice(s) within thirty
(30) calendar days after the submission of the reply briefs and, during such
period, the parties hereto shall make available to the Referee(s) such
individuals and such information, books and records as may be reasonably
requested by such Referee(s) to make its final determination. The Referee(s)
will promptly review only those items and amounts specifically set forth and
objected to in applicable Dispute Notice(s) and resolve the dispute with
respect to each such specific item and amount in accordance with the
Accounting Principles or the Pension Principles, as applicable. The
determination of the matters raised in the applicable Dispute Notice(s) by
the Referee(s) cannot be (i) more favorable to the Buyers, than the related
amount reflected in the Buyers Underfunded Amount Statement nor more
favorable to the Seller Parties than the related amount reflected in the
applicable Underfunded Dispute Notice, with respect to disputes over the
Underfunded Amount, or (ii) more favorable to the Buyers, than the related
amount reflected in the Buyers Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement
nor more favorable to the Seller Parties than the related amount reflected in
the applicable Closing Statement Dispute Notice with respect to disputes over
the Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Closing Statement. The fees and expenses
of the Referee(s) will be allocated between the Buyers, on the one hand, and
the Seller Parties, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the
portion of the matters raised in the applicable Dispute Notice(s) not awarded
to such party bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For
example, if the Seller Parties claim that the appropriate adjustments are, in
the aggregate, $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Buyers and if
the Referee(s) ultimately resolves such matters by awarding to the
Seller Parties, in the aggregate, $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the
fees, costs and expenses of the Referee(s) will be allocated 30% (i.e., $300 ÷
$1,000) to the US Buyer and the Non-US Buyer and 70% (i.e., $700 ÷ $1,000) to
the Seller Parties.

2.5.6. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

the Working Capital reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement, then at the
Buyers absolute discretion, either the US Buyer or the Non-US Buyer will pay
to Seller the amount of such excess, or if the amount of Working Capital
reflected on the Final Statement is less than the Working Capital reflected
on the Estimated Closing Statement, then the Seller Parties

 



20  will pay at the Buyers absolute discretion, either to the US Buyer or the
Non-US buyer, the absolute value of the amount of such shortfall;

 

(ii) if the Net Foreign Debt reflected on the Final Statement exceeds the Net
Foreign Debt reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement, then Seller
Parties will pay to Non-US Buyer the amount of such excess, or if the amount
of Net Foreign Debt reflected on the Final Statement is less than the Net
Foreign Debt reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement, then the Non-US
Buyer will pay to Seller the absolute value of the amount of such shortfall;

(iii) if the aggregate amount of Other Long Term Liabilities reflected on the
Final Statement exceeds the aggregate amount of Other Long Term Liabilities
reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement, then Seller Parties will pay to
Non-US Buyer the amount of such excess, or if the aggregate amount of Other
Long Term Liabilities reflected on the Final Statement is less than the
aggregate amount of Other Long Term Liabilities reflected on the Estimated
Closing Statement, then the Non-US Buyer will pay to Seller the absolute
value of the amount of such shortfall;

(iv) if the Mexican Benefit Liability reflected on the Final Statement
exceeds the Mexican Benefit Liability reflected on the Estimated Closing
Statement, then Seller Parties will pay to Non-US Buyer the amount of such
excess, or if the amount of Mexican Benefit Liability reflected on the Final
Statement is less than the Mexican Benefit Liability reflected on the
Estimated Closing Statement, then the Non-US Buyer will pay to Seller the
absolute value of the amount of such shortfall;

 

(v) US Buyer will pay to Seller the amount of Undistributed Domestic Cash, if

Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.5.6(a) shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated
in writing by the Party entitled to receive such payment. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the Parties agree that any amounts to be paid by a
Party to any other Party pursuant to this Section 2.5.6(a) shall be net
against any amounts to be received by such paying Party from such other Party
pursuant to this Section 2.5.6(a).

 

(b) _Underfunded Amount_. Promptly, and in any event no later than the fifth
Business Day, after final determination of the Underfunded Amount in
accordance with Section 2.5.4 or 2.5.5 (the " _Final Underfunded Amount_ "),
the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows:

 

(i) If the Final Underfunded Amount exceeds the Estimated Underfunded Amount
reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement, then

 



21  Seller Parties will pay to Buyer the amount of such excess by wire transfer
of immediately available funds; or

Underfunded Amount reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement, then US
Buyer will pay to the Seller the amount of such shortfall by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

2.5.7. _Purchase Price Allocation_.

(a) For Income Tax purposes, the Parties will treat the US Purchase Price as
the purchase price of AandE Opco LLC and the Non-US Purchase Price as the
purchase price of the Company, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

 

(b) _Allocation of the US Purchase Price_.

 

(i) Within 90 days after the Closing, the Buyers shall prepare and deliver to
the Seller an Allocation Schedule (the " _US Allocation Schedule_ ") that
allocates the US Purchase Price, and the amount of liabilities of AandE Opco LLC
that are liabilities for Income Tax purposes, among the assets of AandE Opco LLC
to be consistent with the fair market value of such assets and in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code, and the U.S. Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

(ii) The Seller shall have a period of thirty (30) Business Days after the
delivery of the US Allocation Schedule (the " _US Response Period_ ") to
notify the Buyers of any objections that the Seller may have to the
allocations set forth therein (an " _Objections Notice_ "). Unless the Seller
timely objects, the US Allocation Schedule shall be binding on the Parties
without further adjustment, absent manifest error.

(iii) If the Seller shall raise any objections to the US Allocation Schedule
within the US Response Period, the Buyers and the Seller shall negotiate in
good faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
dispute. If the Parties fail to agree within thirty (30) calendar days after
the delivery of the Objections Notice, then the disputed items shall be
resolved by an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Buyers
and the Seller whose determination shall be final and binding on the Parties.
Such accounting firm shall resolve the dispute within thirty (30) calendar
days after the item has been referred to it. In resolving the dispute, the
accounting firm shall allocate the US Purchase Price in a manner consistent
with Section 1060 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. One-half of the costs, fees and expenses of such accounting firm
shall be paid by the Buyers and one-half of the costs, fees and expenses of
such accounting firm shall be paid by the Seller.

 

(iv) Unless otherwise required by applicable law, the Buyers and the Seller
shall file all Tax Returns (including Form 8594) consistent with the

 



22  US Allocation Schedule as ultimately determined pursuant to Section 2.5.7(b)
and (d).

(c) _Allocation of the Non-US Purchase Price._

(i) Within 90 days after the Closing, the Buyers shall prepare and deliver to
the Seller an Allocation Schedule (the " _Non-US Allocation Schedule_ ") that
allocates the Non-US Purchase Price, and the amount of liabilities of the
Company that are liabilities for Income Tax purposes, among the assets of the
Company in a manner consistent with the fair market value of such assets.

(ii) The Seller shall have a period of thirty (30) Business Days after the
delivery of the Non-US Allocation Schedule (the " _Non-US Response Period_ ")
to notify the Buyers of any objections that the Seller may have to the
allocations set forth therein (an " _Objections Notice_ "). Unless the Seller
timely objects, the Non-US Allocation Schedule shall be binding on the Parties
without further adjustment, absent manifest error.

(iii) If the Seller shall raise any objections to the Non-US Allocation
Schedule within the Non-US Response Period, the Buyers and the Seller shall
negotiate in good faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve such dispute. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve any
dispute with respect to the Non-US Allocation Schedule within thirty (30)
calendar days after the delivery of the Objections Notice, the Seller will not
be bound by the Non-US Allocation Schedule prepared by the Buyers, and each
Seller Party may independently determine its own allocation of the Non-US
Purchase Price and file its Tax Returns (and Tax Returns of its Affiliates)
using alternative allocations of its choosing.

(iv) If the Seller and the Buyers ultimately agree on the Non-US Allocation
Schedule, (x) such Allocation Schedule shall be amended pursuant to the
procedures set out in Section 2.5.7(d)) to reflect any adjustment to the Non-
US Purchase Price and (y) unless otherwise required by applicable law, the
Buyers and the Seller shall file all Income Tax Returns consistent with the
Non-US Allocation Schedule as it may be amended from time to time.

(d) If there is an adjustment to the purchase price pursuant to Section 2.5.6
or otherwise, then within fifteen (15) days following any such adjustment,
the Buyers shall deliver to the Seller a revised US Allocation Schedule and a
revised Non-US Allocation Schedule which shall (i) allocate such adjustment
among the items set out on such Allocation Schedule consistent with the
requirements set forth in Section 2.5.7(b) (i) and (c)(i), and (iii) be
subject to the same review, dispute resolution and filing provisions as set
forth in Section 2.5.7(b) and (c).

Domestic Subsidiary and Foreign Subsidiaries to dividend and distribute to
Seller any and all available Cash prior to Closing and, in any event, at least

, the Seller Parties may file a Form 3115, _Application for Change in

financial and operating data and information and documents pertaining to the
Acquired Companies and the Unconsolidated Entities and to make copies of such

obtaining the Material Third-Party Consents and all other notices and consents
pursuant to Section 5.2), in the case of (i) Transfer Taxes, and (ii) filing
or notice fees incurred in connection with the Restructuring or the
Contemplated Transactions that are reasonable and documented third-party, out
of pocket costs, that would not have been incurred by any of the Seller
Parties or the Company or any of its Affiliates if the
Contemplated Transaction was structured as only a purchase of the stock of
the Company by a Delaware corporation, assuming that the Restructuring did not
occur (the " _Shared Incremental Expenses_ "), the Buyers shall pay, or
reimburse the Seller Parties for the first $250,000 of all Shared Incremental
Expenses and 50% of all Shared Incremental Expenses incurred in excess of
$250,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "); and

 

(b) if the Closing does not occur (other than as a result of a breach of this

Company relating to any past or current transaction, arrangement or agreement
(each a " _Transaction Bonus_ "),

 



50  the Seller Parties shall cause the applicable Acquired Company to make any
such payments prior to the Closing.

5.5. _Publicity_ . Promptly following execution of this Agreement, the Parties
and/or their Affiliates shall issue a press release, in form and substance
heretofore agreed. No other public announcement or disclosure will be made by
any Party, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions without the prior written consent of the other
Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this Section 5.5
will not prohibit any disclosure reasonably advisable in order to comply with,
or required by any applicable Legal Requirements (in which case the disclosing
Party will provide the other Parties with the opportunity to review in
advance the disclosure), any disclosure made pursuant to a request from a
Governmental Authority to the extent that failure to satisfy any such request
would reasonably result in adverse consequences to such disclosing Party or
any of its Affiliates, or any disclosure made in connection with the

Contemplated Transactions. Buyer hereby reaffirms its obligations under the
letter agreement dated as of June 8, 2011 between KPS Capital Partners and
Parent (the " _NDA_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in

communications between the Buyers and the investors or potential investors of
the Buyers or its and their Affiliates in the Ordinary Course of Business.

5.6. _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing Date, upon the request
of any Seller Party or the Buyers, each of the Parties hereto will do,
execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds,
assignments, transfers, conveyances and other instruments and papers as may
be reasonably required or appropriate to carry out the Contemplated
Transactions.

5.7.  _Employee Benefit Matters_.

5.7.1. _Continuing Employment_. The Parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that, as of the Closing those Employees who are employed by an Acquired
Company immediately prior to the Closing, (including an Employee on medical,
disability, family or other authorized leave of absence, provided such
Employee returns to active duty within one hundred eighty (180) days
following the Closing Date unless prohibited by local Legal Requirements), but
not including any Employee on layoff, unauthorized leave of absence or other
leave for bad behavior, will remain employees of the Acquired Companies
immediately following consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and will be referred to herein as " _Continuing Employees_." For a
period of one year after the Closing (the " _Continuation Period_ "), and
subject to the further provisions of this Section 5.7: each of the Buyers
shall provide or cause its Affiliates to provide to each Continuing Employee
(1) base wages or salaries, as applicable, at least equal to those provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing; (2) annual
incentive or bonus opportunities that are comparable, in the aggregate, to the
annual incentive or bonus opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
commitment shall not apply to any Buyer Equity Plan; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the US Buyer hereby agrees to keep the Companys Incentive Compensation
Plan for 2012 and all contingent awards previously granted thereunder in
effect for all Company Continuing Employees (other than the Listed Continuing
Employees) for the remainder of the Companys fiscal year 2012, and (3)
employee benefit plans,

 



51  programs, policies and arrangements that are comparable, in the aggregate,
to the employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such commitment shall not apply to the Parents Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan or the Parents Flexible Deferral Plan.

 

5.7.2. _Employee Welfare Benefit Plans_. On the Closing Date, the US Buyer or
its Affiliates shall have in effect employee welfare benefit plans for the
benefit of Company Continuing Employees on and after the Closing Date. Any
such employee welfare benefit plan will give effect, in determining any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such
Company Continuing Employees with respect to similar Employee Plans in which
such Company Continuing Employees participated prior to the Closing Date. With
respect to employee welfare benefit plans that provide health, dental,
medical, life insurance, short-term disability, accidental death and
dismemberment and other welfare benefits, Seller Parties shall retain
responsibility for and continue to pay all plan expenses and benefits for each
Company Continuing Employee with respect to claims incurred by such Company
Continuing Employees or their covered dependents before the Closing provided
such claims are submitted for payment within three hundred sixty-five (365)
days after the Closing Date (including expenses or hospital confinements
existing on the Closing Date), in each case, to the extent the aggregate
amount of any and all such claims and related expenses and benefits exceed the
reserve therefor set forth on the Final Statement or is not
otherwise recoverable by the Company under applicable insurance policies.
Seller Parties shall have no responsibility for expenses and benefits relating
to any such claims incurred by Company Continuing Employees after the Closing
Date (including for pre-existing conditions) under employee welfare benefit
plans sponsored by the US Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing. The US
Buyer shall be responsible for and pay all benefits due for each Company
Continuing Employee with respect to claims incurred by such Company
Continuing Employees or their covered dependents before the Closing (including
expenses or hospital confinements existing on the Closing Date) to the extent
such claims are submitted for payment more than three hundred sixty-five
(365) days after the Closing Date.

5.7.3. _Service Credit_. The US Buyer shall cause the Company Employees to be
given full credit for all service with Seller Parties, the Company or an
Affiliate prior to the Closing Date for all purposes (including eligibility,
vesting and benefit accrual) under any Employee Plan (other than any
Buyer Equity Plan) in which such Company Employees participate from and after
the Closing Date to the same extent such service was recognized by Seller
Parties, the Company or an Affiliate immediately prior to the Closing Date
except as would result in duplication of benefits.

5.7.4. _Defined Contribution Plan_.

 

(a) Each Company Continuing Employee and other Company Employee participating
in the Parents Retirement and Savings Plan (the " _Parent Savings Plan_ ")
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Savings Plan Employees_ ") shall
continue to participate in, and in the case of Company Continuing Employees,
to accrue benefits under, the Parent Savings Plan until November 30, 2011
(the " _Savings Plan Transfer Date_ "). The US Buyer or its Affiliates shall
promptly remit to the trustee for the Parent Savings Plan all 

 



52  contributions required to made on behalf of Savings Plan Employees with
respect to the period from the Closing Date to the Savings Plan Transfer Date.

 

(b) On or before the Savings Plan Transfer Date, the US Buyer or its
Affiliates shall have in effect a defined contribution plan (the " _Buyer DC
Plan_ "). Each Savings Plan Employee shall become a participant in the Buyer
DC Plan as of the Savings Plan Transfer Date. The Buyer DC Plan shall be
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) and other applicable provisions
of the Code and shall provide for employer contribution levels and other
provisions applicable to the Savings Plan Employees comparable to the employer
contribution levels and other provisions applicable to the Savings Plan
Employees under the Parent Savings Plan immediately prior to the Closing. The
US Buyer shall maintain, or shall cause to be maintained, such contribution
levels and other provisions under the Buyer DC Plan throughout the
Continuation Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer DC Plan shall not
be required to provide, as matching contributions or otherwise, securities
issued by the US Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or to offer such securities
as an investment option. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Savings Plan Transfer Date, Parent shall cause the trustee of the Parent
Savings Plan to transfer, in kind (including the securities of Parent) and in
accordance with Section 414(l) of the Code, the full account balances of the
Savings Plan Employees under the Parent Savings Plan to the appropriate
trustee as designated by the US Buyer under the trust agreement forming part
of the Buyer DC Plan; it being understood that, except as otherwise
provided under applicable Legal Requirements, none of the US Buyer, any of
its Affiliates nor the Buyer DC Plan shall assume any liabilities, obligations
or expenses related to the Parent Savings Plan other than the obligation to
administer the transferred account balances in accordance with the Buyer DC
Plan and applicable Legal Requirements (including Section 414(l) of the Code).
Such transfer shall include and give effect to outstanding loan balances under
the Parent Savings Plan as of the Savings Plan Transfer Date. Such transfers
may be made in installments as mutually agreed between Parent and the US
Buyer. Parent shall make all necessary amendments to the Parent Savings Plan
to provide for the transfer of assets described in this Section 5.7.4, and
Parent and the US Buyer shall cooperate to make all filings with applicable
government authorities required with respect to such transfer and to effect
the transfer contemplated by this Section 5.7.4. Parent shall make all
required contributions that relate to periods (whether or not full payroll
periods) ending on or prior to the Closing Date. Each Savings Plan Employee
shall remain a participant in the Parent Savings Plan with respect to his or
her account balance until the trust-to-trust transfer contemplated by this
Section 5.7.4 is completed, and during such time, the account balance for such
employee shall be credited with applicable earnings and such employee shall
have the right to withdraw any portion of his or her account balance in
accordance with the terms of the Parent Savings Plan.

5.7.5.  _Defined Benefit Plan_. The Company Continuing Employees shall cease
to be eligible to actively participate in, or to accrue benefits under,
Parents Employees Pension Plan, which is a single employee plan (within the
meaning of Title IV of ERISA) and is not a plan described in Sections 413(b)
or (c) of the Code (the " _Parent Pension Plan_ ") as of the Closing.
Effective as of the Closing Date, The US Buyer or its Affiliates shall have in
effect a defined benefit pension plan (the " _Buyer Pension Plan_ "). Each
Company Continuing Employee and other Company Employees participating in the
Parent Pension Plan as of the Closing Date (" _Pension Plan Employees_ ")
shall become a participant in the Buyer Pension

 



53  Plan on the Closing Date. The Buyer Pension Plan shall be intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) and other applicable provisions of the Code and
shall have provisions applicable to Pension Plan Employees that are
substantially similar to the provisions applicable to Pension Plan Employees
under the Parent Pension Plan as of the Closing. The Parties intend that the
liabilities and assets of the Parent Pension Plan attributable to Pension
Plan Employees shall be transferred to the Buyer Pension Plan in accordance
with Section 414(l) of the Code, Treasury Regulation Section 1.414(l)-1, and
Section 208 of ERISA. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing
Date, Parent and the US Buyer (acting directly or through their respective
Affiliates) shall, to the extent necessary, file an IRS Form 5310-A regarding
the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Parent Pension Plan to the
Buyer Pension Plan.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the actuary for the Parent Pension Plan to determine the estimated
value, as of the Closing Date, of the assets to be transferred to the Buyer
Pension Plan in accordance with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation safe-
harbor assumptions and methods described in Section 4044 of ERISA and related
regulations applicable on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Pension Transfer
Amount_ ").

(b) On the Closing Date, Parent shall transfer to the Buyer Pension Plan an
amount in cash at least sufficient to fund benefit payments to Pension Plan
Employees reasonably projected to be required under the Buyer Pension Plan
prior to the Initial Transfer Date (the " _Initial Cash Transfer_ "). Within
thirty (30) days (or such later time as mutually agreed to by the Parties)
following the determination of the Estimated Pension Transfer Amount, Parent
and the US Buyer (each acting directly or through their respective Affiliates)
shall cooperate in good faith to cause an initial transfer of assets (the date
of such transfer, the " _Initial Transfer Date_ ") from the trust for the
Parent Pension Plan to the trust for the Buyer Pension Plan in an amount equal
to ninety (90%) percent of the Estimated Pension Transfer Amount minus the
Initial Cash Transfer, adjusted to reflect earnings or losses during the
period from the Closing Date to the Initial Transfer Date (such amount, the "
_Initial Transfer Amount_ "). Such earnings or losses shall be determined
based on the actual rate of return of the Parent Pension Plan for the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending immediately prior to the Initial
Transfer Date. Parent shall satisfy its obligation pursuant to this section by
transferring assets having a then fair market value equal to the Initial
Transfer Amount, such transfer shall be made in cash or, if and to the extent
Buyer so requests and Seller agrees, in kind; _provided_ , that with respect
to three Specified Investments, such transfer shall be made in kind and (i)
shall be made, with respect to those Specified Investments, on a pro rata
basis and (ii) shall not be required to represent a larger percentage of the
Initial Transfer Amount than the percentage of those Specified Investments
represented of the entire portfolio at September 30, 2011 (estimated at
16.5%). For purposes of this paragraph, "Specified Investments" means the
investments set out in _Schedule 5.7.5(b)_.

 

(c) Within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Initial Transfer
Date, Parent shall cause the actuary for the Parent Pension Plan to provide
the US Buyer with a revised calculation of the value, as of the Closing Date,
of the assets to be transferred to the Buyer Pension Plan determined in
accordance with the assumptions and valuation 

 



54  methodology described above (the " _Revised Pension Transfer Amount_ "). The
actuary for the Parent Pension Plan and the actuary for the Buyer Pension Plan
shall cooperate in good faith to verify the Revised Pension Transfer Amount
in a timely manner. In the event the actuary for the Buyer Pension Plan
determines that the value, as of the Closing Date, of the assets to be
transferred to the Buyer Pension Plan differs from the Revised Pension
Transfer Amount, the actuary for the Buyer Pension Plan and the actuary for
the Parent Pension Plan shall use good faith efforts to reconcile any such
difference. If the actuary for the Buyer Pension Plan and the actuary for
the Parent Pension Plan fail to reconcile such difference and (A) the
calculation by the actuary for the Buyer Pension Plan is within one percent
(1%) of the Revised Pension Transfer Amount, the average of the Revised
Pension Transfer Amount and the calculation by the actuary for the Buyer
Pension Plan shall be used; or (B) the difference between the calculation by
the actuary for the Buyer Pension Plan and the Revised Pension Transfer Amount
exceeds one percent (1%), the actuary for the Buyer Pension Plan and the
actuary for the Parent Pension Plan shall jointly designate a third,
independent actuary whose calculation of the value, as of the Closing Date, of
the assets to be transferred to the Buyer Pension Plan shall be final and
binding; provided, that, such calculation must be performed in accordance with
the assumptions and valuation methodology set forth above. The US Buyer and
Parent shall each pay one-half of the costs incurred in connection with
the retention of such independent actuary. The final, verified value, as of
the Closing Date, of the assets to be transferred to the Buyer Pension Plan as
determined in accordance with this section shall be referred to as the "
_Final Pension Transfer Amount_."

(d) Within thirty (30) days of the determination of the Final Pension
Transfer Amount, Parent shall cause the trust for the Parent Pension Plan to
transfer to the trust for the Buyer Pension Plan (the date of such transfer,
the " _Final Transfer Date_ ") an amount, in cash, equal to (A) the Final
Pension Transfer Amount minus (B) the sum of (1) the Initial Cash Transfer,
(2) the Initial Transfer Amount (determined as of the Closing Date and prior
to adjustment for post-Closing earnings and losses), and (3) the aggregate
amount of any payments made from the Parent Pension Plan to Pension Plan
Employees in order to satisfy any benefit obligation with respect to such
Pension Plan Employees during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the date of the Initial Cash Transfer (such amount the " _True-Up
Amount_ "); provided, that, the True-Up Amount shall be adjusted to reflect
earnings or losses through the Final Transfer Date; and provided, further,
that in the event the sum of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above is greater than
the Final Pension Transfer Amount, Parent shall not be required to cause any
such additional transfer and instead the US Buyer shall be required to cause a
transfer of cash from the trust for the Buyer Pension Plan to the trust for
the Parent Pension Plan in an amount equal to the amount by which the sum of
clauses (1), (2) and (3) above exceeds the Final Pension Transfer Amount. The
Parties acknowledge that the Parent Pension Plans transfer of the True-Up
Amount to the Buyer Pension Plan shall be in full settlement and satisfaction
of the obligations of Parent and Parent Pension Plan to transfer assets to the
Buyer Pension Plan pursuant to this section, except as Section 414(l) of the
Code or Section 208 of ERISA may require. The True-Up Amount shall be paid
from the trust for the Parent Pension Plan to the trust for the Buyer Pension
Plan, in cash, and adjusted to reflect earnings or losses during the period
from the Closing Date to the Final Transfer Date. Such earnings or losses
shall be determined based

 



55  on the actual rate of return of the Parent Pension Plan for the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending immediately prior to the Final
Transfer Date.

 

5.7.6. _Supplemental Life Insurance Plans_. The Company Continuing Employees
shall cease to be eligible to participate in Parents Executive Bonus
Insurance Plan and Key Employee Life Insurance Plan (collectively, the "
_Parent Life Insurance Plans_ ") as of the Closing Date. On the Closing Date,
the US Buyer or its Affiliates shall have in effect two life insurance plans
which shall provide benefit formulas and provisions that are identical to the
benefit formulas and provisions applicable to Company Continuing Employees
under the Parent Life Insurance Plans as of the Closing Date (the " _Buyer
Life Insurance Plans_ "). The US Buyer shall maintain the Buyer Life Insurance
Plans for three years following the Closing Date, and with respect to the
Listed Continuing Employees, as applicable, for such period as required to
meet the terms of the Employment Agreements.

5.7.7. _Survivor s Benefit Program_. Company Employees shall cease to
participate in Parents Survivors Benefit Program as of the Closing Date. On
the Closing Date, the US Buyer or its Affiliates shall have in effect a plan
which shall provide a survivor benefit and provisions that are identical to
the survivor benefit and provisions applicable to those Company Employees
covered under Parents Survivors Benefit Program as of the Closing Date, and
the US Buyer or its Affiliates shall maintain that plan throughout the
Continuation Period.

5.7.8. _Parent Deferred Compensation Plans_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall retain all
Liabilities, obligations and commitments with respect to Continuing Employees
under Parents Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and Flexible Deferral
Plan. The Parent acknowledges that under the terms of such plan, each
participating Continuing Employee shall become vested in his or her benefits
as a result of consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, and Parent shall
administer such benefits in accordance with such vesting.

5.7.9. _Parent Equity-Based Compensation Plans_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall retain all
liabilities, obligations and commitments with respect to the all awards
granted to Continuing Employees under Parents equity-based incentive
compensation plans. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall take all actions
reasonably required in order to vest any outstanding awards to the Company
Continuing Employees under such plans.

5.7.10. _COBRA_. Effective as of the Closing Date, the US Buyer shall assume
all obligations, liabilities and commitments in respect of providing notices
and making available the health care continuation coverage required by COBRA
for all Company Continuing Employees (and their qualifying spouses or
dependents) who become eligible for such coverage at any time following the
Closing Date. With respect to all Company Employees (and their qualifying
spouses and dependents) who become eligible for such coverage at any time
prior to the Closing Date, and with respect to all Company Employees who are
not Company Continuing Employees and who become eligible for such coverage at
any time after the Closing Date, Seller Parties shall retain all obligations,
liabilities and commitments in respect of such Company Employees under COBRA.

 



56 5.7.11. _No Rights Conferred on Employees_. The US Buyer and the
Seller Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 5.7 are included for the sole benefit of the US Buyer and the Seller
Parties and nothing contained herein shall be construed as an amendment to any
employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or contract or create any third-
party beneficiary or other rights in any other person, including any employee
or former employee of any of the US Buyer or the Seller Parties or their
respective Affiliates, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof and nothing
herein shall prevent the US Buyer from amending, modifying or terminating any
plan or arrangement or from terminating any employee.

5.8. _Tax Matters_.

5.8.1. Except as provided otherwise in Section 5.4.1(a), all Transfer Taxes
incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid one-
half by the Buyers and one-half by Seller when due. Seller shall file, to the
extent it is required to do so by applicable Tax laws, all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. The
Buyers or the Company shall file any other Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to such Transfer Taxes. To the extent required by applicable Tax
laws, the Seller, the Buyers and each Acquired Company will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation. Each Party shall be
entitled to any foreign Tax credits or other Tax benefits resulting from
or attributable to the Transfer Taxes paid by such Party.

5.8.2. Any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 5.8.2 shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed
in prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns, except for changes
required by changes in applicable Tax laws or changes in fact. The following
provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as between the
Parties for certain Tax Return filing obligations following the Closing Date:

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared at its expense and file or
cause to be filed all United States federal, state and local Income Tax
Returns for the Acquired Companies for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date regardless of when they are to be filed. Seller shall deliver
such Tax Returns (or in the case of a consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax
Return, the portion of any such Tax Return that relates to one or more of the
Acquired Companies) to the US Buyer (together with supporting schedules
reasonably requested by the US Buyer) for its review at least forty-five (45)
days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is required to be filed. The
US Buyer shall review such Tax Returns within twenty (20) days after the
delivery of such Tax Returns (the " _Tax Review Period_ "). The US Buyer will
be deemed to have approved such Tax Returns as prepared by Seller if it does
not submit comments within such Review Period. If the US Buyer delivers
comments to the Seller within such Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall use
good faith efforts to resolve any dispute in connection with such comments. In
the event the US Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on any such revisions
within ten (10) days after US Buyer provides its comments, the US Buyer and
Seller shall engage an independent public accounting firm mutually acceptable
to the US Buyer and the Seller whose determination shall be final and binding
on the Parties. Such accounting firm shall resolve the dispute

 



57  within twenty (20) calendar days after the item has been referred to it.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.8.2(a), the Seller
shall be entitled to file on behalf of the Acquired Companies, or cause to be
filed, the applicable Tax Return without having incorporated the disagreed
upon changes to avoid a late filing of such Tax Return. In the event the
independent public accounting firms resolution of the dispute necessitates
that a Tax Return filed in accordance with the previous sentence be amended,
the Seller shall cause an amended Tax Return to be filed that reflects such
resolution. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne in
the manner set forth in the final two sentences of Section 2.5.5. Seller shall
timely pay, or cause to be timely paid, the United States federal, state and
local Income Taxes payable by the Acquired Companies with respect to
such periods.

(b) Except as expressly provided in Section 5.8.2(a), the Buyers shall prepare
or cause to be prepared at its expense and file or cause to be filed any and
all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies for any and all Tax periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date and for Tax periods which begin before or on
the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date, in each case, regardless of
when they are to be filed. With respect to such Tax Returns, if the Seller
requests in writing, Buyers shall deliver a copy of such Tax Returns to the
Seller (together with supporting schedules reasonably requested by the
Seller) for its review at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date on
which such Tax Return is required to be filed. The Seller shall review such
Tax Returns within the Tax Review Period. The Seller will be deemed to have
approved such Tax Returns as prepared by the Buyers if it does not submit
comments within such Review Period. If the Seller delivers comments to the
Buyers within the Review Period, the Buyers and the Seller shall use good
faith efforts to resolve any dispute in connection with such comments. In the
event the Buyers and the Seller are unable to agree on any such revisions
within ten (10) days after the Seller provides its comments, the Buyers and
the Seller shall engage an independent public accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Buyers and the Seller whose determination shall be final and
binding on the Parties. Such accounting firm shall resolve the dispute within
twenty (20) calendar days after the item has been referred to it.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.8.2(b), the Buyers
shall be entitled to file on behalf of the Acquired Companies, or cause to be
filed, the applicable Tax Return without having incorporated the disagreed
upon changes to avoid a late filing of such Tax Return. In the event the
independent public accounting firms resolution of the dispute necessitates
that a Tax Return filed in accordance with the previous sentence be amended,
the Buyers shall cause an amended Tax Return to be filed that reflects such
resolution. The Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, at the times set out in
Section 5.8.2(c), the foreign Income Taxes due and payable by the
Acquired Companies with respect to a Tax period or portion thereof ending on
or before the Effective Time, but only to the extent such Taxes, in the
aggregate, exceed the amount accrued for foreign Income Taxes in computing
Working Capital as reflected on the Final Statement. With respect to a Tax
period of an Acquired Company that begins before and ends on or after the
Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes attributable to the portion of such
Tax period ending on the Effective Time shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books of such Acquired Company as of the Effective
Time.

 



58 (c) On or before October 15, 2012, the Buyers shall (x) notify the Seller of
the amount, if any, due from the Seller in respect of foreign Income Taxes
pursuant to Section 5.8.2(b), determined by reference to the foreign Income
Tax Returns filed by the Acquired Companies on or before September 30,
2012, and (y) provide the Seller a copy of all such foreign Income Tax
Returns and a schedule in reasonable detail of the amount, if any, due from
the Seller in respect of such Taxes pursuant to Section 5.8.2(b) (together
with supporting workpapers and other documents reasonably requested without
undue delay by the Seller). Any amount so due from the Seller shall be paid
within twenty (20) Business Days following Buyers delivery of such Tax
Returns, schedule and supporting documents. For any foreign Income Tax
Returns filed by the Acquired Companies after September 30, 2012, the Buyers
shall notify the Seller quarterly, with the first such notice to be provided
on January 15, 2013, of the amount of foreign Income Taxes payable with
respect to such Tax Returns filed in the preceding quarter that are
attributable to a period ending on or before the Effective Time, including a
copy of such foreign Income Tax Returns and a schedule in reasonable detail
of the amount, if any, due from the Seller in respect of such Taxes pursuant
to Section 5.8.2(b) (together with supporting workpapers and other documents
reasonably requested without undue delay by the Seller). Any amount due from
the Seller with respect to foreign Income Tax Returns filed after September
30, 2012 shall be paid within twenty (20) Business Days following Buyers
delivery of such Tax Returns, schedule and supporting documents.

 

(d) If, following the filing of the last foreign Income Tax Return of any of
the Acquired Companies for a Tax period that ends on or before or includes
the Closing Date (or, to the extent any item on such Tax Return is disputed
pursuant to the provisions of 5.8.2(b), the final resolution of such dispute
and, if required, the filing of an amended Tax Return), the amount of foreign
Income Taxes due and payable by the Acquired Companies attributable to periods
ending on or before the Effective Time is less than the aggregate amount
accrued as a current liability for such Taxes in determining Working Capital,
the Buyers shall promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days of the
date on which a notice is to be provided to the Seller pursuant to Section
5.8.2(c) with respect to such Tax Return, pay an amount equal to such excess
to the Seller. 

(e) Notwithstanding the forgoing, if the aggregate amount accrued for foreign
Income Taxes in computing Working Capital as reflected on the Final Statement
(the "Foreign Income Tax Accrual") exceeds the aggregate amount of foreign
Income Taxes payable by the Acquired Companies with respect to a Tax period or
portion thereof ending on or before the Effective Time as computed in
accordance with the last sentence of Section 5.8.2(b) (the " _Actual Foreign_
_Income Tax Liability_ ") and determined by reference to the foreign Income
Tax Returns filed by the Acquired Companies on or before December 31, 2012,
the Buyers shall (x) notify the Seller of such amounts, (y) provide the Seller
a copy of all foreign Income Tax Returns not previously provided and a
schedule in reasonable detail showing the amount by which the Foreign Income
Tax Accrual exceeds the Actual Foreign Income Tax Liability, as determined by
reference to the foreign Income Tax Returns filed by the Acquired Companies on
or before December 31, 2012, and pay such amount to the Seller within twenty
(20) Business Days following Buyers delivery of such Tax Returns, schedule.
For any foreign Income Tax Return filed after December 31, 2012 to which
Section 5.8.2(b) applies, if the Foreign Income Tax Accrual exceeds the
Actual Foreign

 



59  Income Tax Liability as computed pursuant to this Section 5.8.2(e), then
Section 5.8.2(b) and Section 5.8.2(c) shall be applied as if the Foreign
Income Tax Accrual amount at the Effective Time was zero.

5.8.3. The Parties agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to the Business, the Acquired Companies and the Unconsolidated
Entities (including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary
for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election relating to
Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax.
In addition to the forgoing, within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
the Buyers shall cause each of the Acquired Companies to prepare and provide
to Parent a package of Tax information materials, including such schedules and
work papers as reasonably requested by Parent to enable Parent to prepare and
file all Tax Returns (i) required to be filed by or with respect to Parent or
its Affiliates (including Forms 5471, earnings and profits, foreign tax
credits, and foreign bank account information), and (ii) required to be filed
by Parent pursuant to Section 5.8.2(a); _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent
such Tax information pertains to Tax Returns to be filed by Parent with
respect to the fiscal year ended October 2, 2011, the Buyers shall cause the
Acquired Companies to deliver such Tax information materials to Parent no
later than February 15, 2012. Within ninety (90) days after the end of the
calendar year that includes the Closing Date, and within ninety (90) days
after the end of each succeeding calendar year to the extent such Tax
information is required to be included in a Tax Return filed by Parent or its
Affiliates, the Buyers shall cause each of the Acquired Companies and
Unconsolidated Entities to prepare and provide to Parent an updated package
of such Tax information materials incorporating any additional information
required with respect to such calendar year (including information regarding
United States earnings and profits). The Buyers shall cause such packages to
be prepared in good faith in a manner (including method of accounting and
presentation) consistent with Parents past practice.

 

5.8.4. The Buyers shall cause each of the Acquired Companies and the
Unconsolidated Entities (i) to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to such Acquired Company or Unconsolidated Entity
relating to any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by or
on behalf of Seller or the Buyers, any extensions thereof) of the respective
Tax periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Governmental Authority. On or after the end of such period, the Buyers
shall provide the Seller Parties with at least ten (10) days prior written
notice before destroying any such books and records, during which period the
party receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense,
of such books and records. The Parties shall cooperate with each other, as
reasonably requested, in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating
to Taxes involving an Acquired Company, an Unconsolidated Entity or the
Business. Any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.8 or pursuant
to any other Section hereof providing for the sharing of information relating
to or review of any Tax Return or other schedule relating to Taxes shall be
kept confidential by the Parties.

 

5.8.5.

 



60 (a) In the case of any audit, examination, or other proceeding
("Tax Proceeding") that solely relates to (i) any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(ii) to a Tax Return of any consolidated, combined or unitary group of which
Seller and the Company were members, or (iii) Taxes for which any Buyer
is indemnified pursuant to this Agreement, the applicable Buyer shall notify
the Seller of such Tax Proceeding within fifteen (15) days after the receipt
by such Buyer or any Acquired Company of written notice thereof; provided,
however, that the failure to give such notice shall not effect such Buyers
rights hereunder, except to the extent that the Seller has been actually
prejudiced thereby. The Buyers shall afford Seller, at Sellers expense, the
opportunity to control the conduct of such Tax Proceeding and the Buyers
shall have the right to attend or participate in such Tax Proceeding;
provided, however, the Buyers shall not have the right, to attend or
participate in any Tax Proceeding that relates to a consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Return of Parent. Seller shall not settle, compromise or concede
any such Tax Proceeding (excluding, however, any Tax Proceeding that relates
to a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return of Parent) without the
consent of the Buyers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

(b) In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to Taxes for which the
Seller is or may be liable pursuant to this Agreement, other than a Tax
Proceeding described in Section 5.8.5(a), the Buyers shall control the conduct
of such Tax Proceeding, but Parent shall have the right to attend and
participate in such Tax Proceeding at its own expense, and the Buyers shall
not settle, compromise and/or concede such Tax Proceeding without the consent
of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

5.8.6. To the extent not included in the Final Statement as adjusted pursuant
to Section 2.5.6, any refund, credit, or reduction in Income Taxes paid or
payable by or with respect to an Acquired Company shall, when actually
realized, be promptly paid as follows (or to the extent payable but not paid
due to offset against other Taxes shall be promptly paid by the Party
receiving the benefit of the offset as follows): (i) to Seller if attributable
to any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Effective Time;
and (ii) to the Buyers if attributable to any Tax period or portion thereof
beginning after the Effective Time.

5.8.7. Any tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements between the Seller
Parties, on the one hand, and the Company and its Domestic Subsidiary, on the
other, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date,
none of the Seller Parties nor any of their remaining Affiliates, nor any of
the Acquired Companies, shall be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.

5.8.8. Except as otherwise provided herein, on the Closing Date, none of the
Acquired Companies shall take, and none of the Buyers or Seller shall cause or
permit any of the Acquired Companies to take, any action not in the Ordinary
Course of Business of such Acquired Company.

5.8.9. Except as otherwise provided herein, on the Closing Date, none of
Seller, the Buyers or their respective Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) shall cause or permit any Domestic Subsidiary to incur, any
"extraordinary item" as defined in Treasury Regulation section
1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(C).

 



61 5.8.10. Unless otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirement, (i)
neither Buyers nor any of their Affiliates shall make or change, or permit any
Acquired Company to make or change, any Tax election, or take any action or
enter into any transaction, in each case after the Closing, that results in
any increased Tax liability of a Seller Party or any of its Affiliates, or
that increases the indemnification obligation of any Seller Party under this
Agreement, and (ii) neither the Buyers nor any of their Affiliates shall cause
or permit any Acquired Company to file an amended Tax Return with respect to
any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, or any Tax period which
begins before or on the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, without
obtaining the prior written consent of the Seller, which consent in the case
of Tax Returns that are part of a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return
may be withheld by the Seller in its discretion, and which consent in the case
of other Tax Returns shall not be unreasonably withheld by the Seller.

5.8.11. The US Buyer shall cause the Domestic Subsidiary to file such
Tax elections as are permitted by law to irrevocably relinquish and forego,
with respect to any net operating loss or capital loss arising in Tax periods
or portions thereof beginning after the Closing Date, the carryback of such
net operating loss for United States federal, state or local Income Tax
purposes to any Tax period or portion thereof of the Domestic Subsidiary
ending on or before the Closing Date, including, without limitation, an
election under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B).

5.8.12. The purchase of the Company Units and the AandE Opco Units contemplated
by this Agreement will, for U.S. federal Income tax purposes, be treated as an
asset purchase by the Seller Parties and the Buyer. All U.S. federal Income
Tax incurred by the Seller Parties upon the sale of the Company Units and
the AandE Opco Units by Seller to the Non-US Buyer and the US Buyer,
respectively pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne by the Seller, and all
items of income, gain, loss or deduction recognized by the Domestic Subsidiary
on the Closing Date under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 as a result
of such sale of interests shall be included on the U.S. federal Income Tax
Return of the Seller Parties. Each of the Seller Parties and the Buyers shall
report, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and all persons related
thereto within the meaning of Section 267(b) of the Code (including, without
limitation, the Company and its Domestic Subsidiary) to report for all Tax
purposes all items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Company
or its Domestic Subsidiary in a manner fully consistent with this Section
5.8.12 unless required to do so by applicable law or a final determination.

 

5.8.13. Upon the request of the Buyers, Parent shall join with the Buyers in
making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any corresponding
or similar elections under state, local or foreign Tax law (collectively the
"Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the purchase and sale of the
stock of the Domestic Subsidiary. Any such request shall be made by the
Buyers in writing no later than 180 days after the Closing Date. In the event
the Buyers do not request that Parent join in making the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, the remainder of the provisions of this Section 5.8.13 shall not
apply. The Non-U.S. Buyer shall prepare and timely file an election under
Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the Foreign Subsidiaries, and shall
prepare and timely file all other forms and documents required in connection
with such Section 338(g) elections.

 



62 (a) The Buyers shall prepare and timely file all forms and documents required
in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election. For the purpose of making
the Section 338(h)(10) Election, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Buyers
and Parent each shall execute two copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form 8023 (or successor form). Seller shall execute (or cause to be executed)
and deliver to the Buyers such additional documents or forms as are reasonably
requested in writing by Buyers to complete the Section 338(h)(10) Election at
least 10 days prior to the date such documents or forms are required to be
filed, and will not take any action, or refrain from taking any action, if
doing so could frustrate such election or otherwise make such election
ineffective or unavailable.

 

(b) The Buyers shall determine and allocate the "aggregate deemed sales price"
("ADSP") with respect to the assets of the applicable Acquired Companies in
accordance with Section 338 of the Code and the applicable Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder or comparable provisions for state, local
and foreign Tax law (the "ADSP Allocation"). The Buyers shall forward a draft
of the ADSP Allocation to Seller for Sellers review and approval, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld. If the Seller approves of the ADSP
Allocation, (i) the Buyers and Seller and their respective Affiliates shall
be bound by the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the ADSP Allocation for all
Tax purposes, and (ii) the Buyers and Seller shall file, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with
the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the ADSP Allocation and shall take no
position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable law or a
final determination.

 

5.9. _Financing_. The Buyers shall use their best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms
described in the Commitment Letter. The Buyers shall not amend the terms of
the Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of the Seller
Parties. 

5.10. _Discontinued Facilities_. Prior to the Closing, Seller Parties shall
cause the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to distribute (directly or
indirectly) to Seller the three currently unused facilities (land and
building) set forth on _Schedule F_ (the " _Discontinued Facilities_ ").

 

5.11. _Intercompany Agreements_. Prior to the Closing, all agreements and
arrangements between a Seller Party on the one hand, and the Company or one
or more of its Subsidiaries on the other hand, including those set forth on
_Schedule H_, shall be terminated and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
shall have any further liabilities or obligations thereunder. 

5.12. _Exclusivity_. No Seller Party will (and Seller Parties will not cause
or permit any Acquired Company to) (i) solicit, initiate, or encourage the
submission of any proposal or offer (whether made following the date hereof or
with respect to any proposal or offer (or modification thereof) received prior
to the date hereof) from any Person relating to the acquisition of any
capital stock or other voting securities, or any substantial portion of the
assets, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any acquisition
of the Company structured as a merger, consolidation, or share exchange) or
(ii) participate in any negotiations or discussions regarding, furnish any
information with respect to, or assist or participate in any of the foregoing.
The Seller Parties shall promptly notify the Buyers of any such proposal
or offer (or modification thereof) and shall provide the Buyers all the
material terms and conditions thereof.

 



63 5.13. _Cooperation_. The Seller Parties agree to cause the Acquired Companies
and their Representatives to provide, upon the reasonable request of the
Buyers, and at the Buyers cost and expense, all reasonable cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing (which, for purposes of this
Section 5.13, shall include any third party debt financing arranged by the
Buyers in lieu, in whole or in part, of the Financing and any post-Closing
financing contemplated by the Buyers), including (i) participation in
meetings, presentations, drafting sessions, and due diligence sessions, (ii)
furnishing the Buyers and their respective Affiliates and its financing
sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Acquired
Companies and the Unconsolidated Entities as may be reasonably requested by
the Buyers, (iii) cooperating with the marketing efforts of the Buyers and
their respective financing sources for any debt to be raised to complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) facilitating the pledging
of collateral, which pledge shall only be effective at (or following) Closing,
and (v) providing and executing documents as are customary for transactions of
the type contemplated by this Agreement and as may be reasonably requested by
the Buyers, which documents shall only be effective at (or following) Closing.

5.14. _Notice of Development_. The Seller Parties may elect at any time to
notify the Buyers of any development that arises after the date of this
Agreement and that causes a breach of any of the representations and
warranties in Section 3\. Unless any Buyer has the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) by reason of such development, and it
exercises that right within the period of ten Business Days after its receipt
of such notice, then the written notice pursuant to this Section 5.14 will be
deemed to have amended any applicable Schedule, to have qualified the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3, and to have cured any
representation or breach of warranty that otherwise might have
existed hereunder by reason of such development.

5.15. _Title Insurance_. If and to the extent required by Buyers
title insurance company in connection with the issuance to such Buyers of an
owners policy with a so called "non-imputation" endorsement in the ALTA form,
each of the Acquired Companies shall deliver to the Buyers an affidavit
providing that, to the best of the actual knowledge of such affiant, without
independent investigation or verification, such affiant has not, within the
three (3) year period immediately preceding the Closing Date, created any
defects, liens or encumbrances with respect to the applicable real property
owned by such party in the United States, except for (i) any matters set forth
by such affiant in such affidavit, (ii) any matters of record as of the date
of such affidavit and (iii) any matters disclosed on a title insurance
commitment or title insurance policy issued by such title insurance company,
or otherwise known to such title insurance company. Seller shall execute each
such affidavit for the purpose of guarantying the obligations of each affiant
thereunder; provided, however, that each such affidavit shall expressly limit
the aggregate liability of all of the Acquired Companies and the Seller under
the affidavits to a total sum of $100,000. 

5.16. _Assignment_. The Seller Parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, assign to the Company, effective at or prior to the Closing,
any and all confidentiality agreements, non-disclosure agreements and other
similar Contractual Obligations entered into in respect of the proposed sale
of the Acquired Companies (collectively, the " _Confidentiality Undertakings_
").

5.17. _Transaction Structure_. During the fifteen (15) day period following
the date hereof, the Seller Parties agree to consider and negotiate reasonably
and in good faith all reasonable

 



64  proposals of the Buyers to modify the Contemplated Transactions, the
Restructuring and/or the other transactions contemplated hereby to the extent
such proposals are reasonably intended to provide more favorable tax,
financing, cash management, governance or reporting conditions or to otherwise
provide a material benefit to the Buyers and/or the Acquired Companies. The
Seller Parties shall not unreasonably withhold, delay or condition any
consent to any modification of this Agreement necessary to effect any such
proposal if such proposal does not directly or indirectly (A) (x) reduce the
Seller Parties after tax realization of the Aggregate Purchase Price, or (y)
increase the costs of or impose any obligations or liabilities on any Seller
Party, unless the Buyers compensate the Seller Parties for all such Losses
and/or costs and fully indemnify the Seller Parties for such obligations or
liabilities, (B) cause (in the reasonable determination of the Parent in good
faith) the Closing to occur any time after the date set forth in Section
8.1(b), or (C) cause the Seller Parties to be in breach of or default under
any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements, unless the Buyers irrevocably waive any such
breach or default and agree to indemnify the Seller Parties and the Acquired
Companies for any Third Party Claim directly or indirectly caused therefrom.

5.18. _Insurance Matters_.

 

5.18.1. With respect to any event that occurs on or before the Closing Date
that gives rise to a claim or claims under any occurrence-based Liability
Policy of the Seller Parties (each a " _Pre-Closing Insurance Claim_ "), the
Seller Parties shall cooperate or cause its Affiliates to cooperate in a
commercially reasonable manner in the making of any such Pre-Closing
Insurance Claim under any of the applicable Liability Policies, if any, but
the Seller Parties, by taking on this obligation, make no representations or
warranties that any particular claim is covered under any of the Liability
Policies. The cooperation described above shall not require the Seller
Parties to bear any material expense in the investigation or submission of any
Pre-Closing Insurance Claim nor shall it require the Seller Parties to fund or
participate, as a party or non-party, in any litigation and/or arbitration
and/or mediation against any insurance carrier regarding any Pre-Closing
Insurance Claim, except to the extent such matters are otherwise subject to
indemnification hereunder. Further, with respect to any such Pre-Closing
Insurance Claim, following the Closing, no Seller Party shall be responsible
for the payment of any deductible and/or any self-insured retention under any
such occurrence-based Liability Policies.

 

5.18.2. For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, the
Seller Parties shall not take, or fail to take, any action that would have
the effect of eliminating or decreasing in any material respect the level or
scope of coverage under the Seller Parties Directors and Officers Liability
insurance policies covering officers and directors of the Acquired Companies
prior to the Closing with respect to any claims arising out of occurrences
prior to the Closing Date.

5.19. _General_. Each of the Parties will use its reasonable best efforts to
take all action and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable in order
to consummate and make effective the Contemplated Transactions (including the
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the Closing conditions set forth in Section 6
and Section 7).

 



65 5.20. _Access to Information; Continuing Disclosure_. Subject to any
Legal Requirement, for a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing,
Buyer shall upon reasonable prior written notice (a) furnish to the Parent
material financial and accounting data and other similar information relating
to any period prior to the Closing reasonably requested by the Parent and (b)
cause the Acquired Companies to provide the Parent with, reasonable access, at
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, to
the employees of the Acquired Companies to answer reasonable inquiries of the
Seller Parties that relate to the information provided pursuant to clause (a)
above. None of the Acquired Companies shall be required to take any action
that would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or a
violation of Legal Requirement. All information furnished pursuant to this
Section 5.20 shall be subject to the terms of the Restrictive Covenants
Agreement of even date herewith between the Parent and the Buyers.

5.21. _A andE Opco LLC_. The Buyers hereby covenant and agree to cause AandE Opco
LLC to become a Subsidiary of the Company immediately after the Closing, and
the Buyers hereby acknowledge that certain of the Seller Parties
representations and warranties contained in Section 3 are dependent upon the
occurrence of such event.

 

5.22. _Release of Parent Guaranty_. Within 90 days after the Closing, the
Buyer and Acquired Companies hereby agree to cause the Parent to be
irrevocably released in full and without any liability or cost from the
guaranty set forth on Schedule O.



   6. | CONDITIONS TO BUYERS OBLIGATIONS AT THE CLOSING. 
---|--- 

The obligations of the Buyers to consummate the Closing is subject to the

each of which may be waived (as a condition to its obligations) by the Buyers
in writing in its absolute discretion:

6.1. _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
the Seller Parties set forth in Section 3.5.1 shall be true and correct in all

apply with respect to any claim made or suit instituted seeking
indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.1.1(b), 9.1.1(c) (other than Section

9.2.1(b).

9.4. _Third Party Claims_.

 



71 9.4.1. If any third party notifies an Indemnified Party with respect to
any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a claim against
an Indemnifying Party under this Section 9, then the Indemnified Party will
promptly give written notice to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying
the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation
under this Section 9, except to the extent such delay actually and
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

9.4.2. The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense
of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of a notice given by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.4.1. In addition, the Indemnifying
Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third
Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party so long as (a) the Indemnifying Party gives written notice
to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party
has given notice of the Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will
indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the entirety of any and all
Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim, and that
no such Losses when combined reasonably with all other Losses for settled
and/or outstanding claims would reasonably be expected to result in Losses
that exceed $15,000,000, (b) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified
Party with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party will have adequate financial resources to defend against
the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations
hereunder, (c) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not
seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party,
(d) the Indemnified Party has not been advised by counsel that an actual or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim, (e) the Third
Party Claim does not relate to or otherwise arise in connection with Taxes or
any criminal or regulatory enforcement Action, (f) settlement of, an adverse
judgment with respect to or the Indemnifying Partys conduct of the defense of
the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified
Party, likely to be adverse to the Indemnified Partys reputation or
continuing business interests (including its relationships with current or
potential customers, suppliers or other parties material to the conduct of its
business) and (g) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third
Party Claim actively and diligently. The Indemnified Party may retain separate
co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will
pay the fees and expenses of separate co-counsel retained by the Indemnified
Party that are incurred prior to Indemnifying Partys assumption of control of
the defense of the Third Party Claim.

 

9.4.3. The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless such
judgment, compromise or settlement (a) provides for the payment by the
Indemnifying Party of money as sole relief for the claimant, (b) results in
the full and general release of Buyer Indemnified Persons or Seller
Indemnified Persons, as applicable, from all liabilities arising or relating
to, or in connection with, the Third Party Claim and (c) involves no finding
or admission of any violation of

 



72  Legal Requirements or the rights of any Person and no effect on any other
claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party.

 

9.4.4. If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver the notice contemplated by
clause (a), or the evidence contemplated by clause (b), of Section 9.4.2
within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the
Third Party Claim, or otherwise at any time fails to conduct the defense of
the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, the Indemnified Party may
defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner
it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not consult with,
or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith).
If such notice and evidence is given on a timely basis and the Indemnifying
Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently
but any of the other conditions in Section 9.4.2 is or becomes unsatisfied,
the Indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third Party
Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not be
bound by the entry of any such judgment consented to, or any such compromise
or settlement effected, without its prior written consent (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event that the Indemnified
Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section
9.4.4, the Indemnifying Party will (a) advance the Indemnified Party promptly
and periodically for the costs of defending against the Third Party Claim
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) and (b) remain responsible
for any and all other Losses that the Indemnified Party may incur or suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by
the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Section 9\.

 

9.4.5. The Buyers and each of Seller Parties, each in its capacity as an
Indemnifying Party, hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any
court in which any Third Party Claim may be brought against any Indemnified
Party for purposes of any claim which such Indemnified Party may have against
such Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement in connection with such
Third Party Claim, and in furtherance thereof, the provisions of Section 10.10
are incorporated herein by reference, mutatis mutandis.

9.5. _Calculation of Losses_.

9.5.1. The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under this Section
9 shall be net any amounts actually recovered by the Party seeking
indemnification or its Affiliates (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") under
applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible therefor. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by
the Party against whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "),
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party
for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses or costs incurred by
such Indemnified Party by reason of making such claim or collecting such
amount. Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect any amounts available under insurance

 



73  coverage, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible, for any Losses
payable under this Section 9\.

 

9.5.2. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Section 9 for any
Losses relating to any matter if and only to the extent that (a) there is
included in the calculation of Working Capital a liability or reserve for such
matter that was not included in the calculation of the Working Capital Target
or (b) the Indemnified Party has otherwise been compensated for such matter
pursuant to the adjustments described in Section 2.5. The Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable under this Section 9 for any Losses relating to the
inadequate accrual of any Tax Liability to the extent that the liability or
reserve included in the calculation of Working Capital for any and all other
Taxes exceeds the actual Liability of the Acquired Companies for such other
Taxes.

 

9.5.3. Each Indemnified Party must mitigate in accordance with applicable law
any Loss for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement.

9.5.4. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under this Section 9 for
any Losses relating to the investigation, control or remediation of Hazardous
Substances on the Real Property pursuant to Environmental Laws (i) unless the
Losses (A) are necessary to meet the requirements of any applicable
Environmental Law or to meet the demands of any applicable Governmental
Authority and (B) result from use of the most reasonable and cost-effective
methods available under the circumstances, in each case based on the
industrial or commercial use of the applicable Real Property as of the
Closing Date or (ii) to the extent the matter resulting in such Losses is
identified as a result of any sampling, testing or other invasive analysis on
the Real Property by Buyer or any Person acting under Buyers direction,
unless (and then only to the extent) such sampling, testing or other invasive
analysis was required by any applicable Environmental Law or applicable
Governmental Authority, or was undertaken in the Ordinary Course of Business
by Buyer in connection with the use, occupancy, expansion, demolition or
decommissioning of the operations on the Real Property. To the extent
necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in this Section, each Party
hereto agrees that engineering or institutional controls and deed or other
restrictions are each a reasonable cost-effective method, so long as such
control or restriction does not limit the industrial or commercial activities
being performed on the applicable Real Property as of the Closing Date except
for limitations of an inconsequential nature. With respect to any Losses for
which any Indemnified Party seeks indemnification relating to any
investigation, remediation or other actions relating to Hazardous Substances
or environmental matters, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to control
and appoint lead counsel or consultants for such defense, investigation,
remedial or other action, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense thereof, in each case at its own expense and shall
cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, with the Indemnifying Party
in connection therewith, as may be reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party.

9.5.5. If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying
Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to Section 9 and the Indemnified
Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party (a
" _Potential Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted against
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign

 



74  such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are
reasonably necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the
Potential Contributor the amount of such payment, except where such
assignment or the enforcement of rights thereunder could reasonably be
expected to result in further Losses to any Indemnified Party including the
loss of any benefits under any insurance policy.

 

9.5.6. For purposes of this Section 9, the representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been made without any qualification as to materiality, Material Adverse
Effect or similar qualifications. All indemnification payments made pursuant
to this Agreement shall be made, together with interest, from the date that
the indemnification payment becomes payable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement to the date of payment, at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A., as in
effect on the date of incurrence.

 

9.6. _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Seller Parties and the Buyers
agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Section 9 as an
adjustment to the US Purchase Price or Non-US Purchase Price, as applicable,
for federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes to the extent permitted by
applicable law.

 

9.7. _Tax Benefit_. Any payment made by any Indemnifying Party hereunder shall
be paid net of any Tax benefit (whether by refund, overpayment, credit, or
reduction in Taxes otherwise payable) actually realized by an Indemnified
Party and any tax cost actually incurred as a result of the receipt of any
indemnity payment by an Indemnified Party (a " _Net Tax Benefit_ "). To the
extent such Net Tax Benefit is not realized during, or prior to, the taxable
year in which such Loss is incurred, the Indemnified Party shall annually
certify to the Indemnifying Party the Net Tax Benefit, if any, realized by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates during or with respect to the
five (5) calendar years following the year in which such Loss was incurred,
and shall remit to the Indemnifying Party the amount of any such Net Tax
Benefit within ten (10) days after the date of realization. The Buyers shall
have no obligation to pay any Net Tax Benefits to the Seller that are realized
after such five year period. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to structure indemnity payments to avoid incurring tax costs by the
Buyers on the receipt thereof.

9.8. _Exclusivity_. After the Closing, and except with respect to claims
arising out of fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, the
enforcement specifically of any covenant requiring performance following the
Closing or claims for equitable relief, this Section 9 will provide the
exclusive remedy for any Indemnified Party for any misrepresentation, breach
of warranty, covenant or other agreement or other claim arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

9.9. _Specified Lease_. If (i) as of the Closing the Seller Parties have not
obtained the required consent of the counterparty to the Specified Lease, and
(ii) as a result of such failure any of the Buyers or the Acquired Companies
incur any Losses, the Seller Parties shall reimburse the Buyers and/or the
Acquired Companies for any and all such Losses, including all Losses incurred
in connection with shipping any products to customers or relocating to a new
facility; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate amount for which the
Seller Parties shall be liable under this Section 9.9 shall be limited to
$400,000.

Each of the parties to this Agreement may specify different address, facsimile
number or e-mail address by giving notice in accordance with this Section
10.1 to each of the other parties hereto.

10.2. _Succession and Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiary_. Subject to the
immediately following sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, each of which such successors and permitted assigns will
be deemed to be a party hereto for all purposes hereof. No party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other parties;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any Buyer may (i) assign any or
all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates or,
solely with respect to the period following the Closing, to any purchaser of
all or substantially all the assets of such Buyer or any such assignee of
such Buyer; (ii) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its
obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases such Buyer nonetheless
shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its obligations
hereunder); or (iii) collaterally assign its rights under this Agreement to
any financial or lending institution providing financing to Buyer or any
Affiliate of such Buyer. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement
is for the sole benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and
assignees and nothing herein expressed or implied will give or be construed to
give any Person, other than the parties and such successors and assignees,
any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

10.3. _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by each of the Parties hereto, or in the case of
a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No waiver
by any Party of any breach or violation or, default under or inaccuracy in
any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or
not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent breach, violation,
default of, or inaccuracy in, any such representation, warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence. No delay or omission on the part of any Party in
exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a
waiver thereof.

10.4. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the NDA,
the Ancillary Agreements and any documents, instruments and certificates
explicitly referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any
and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings,
understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto.

10.5.  _Schedules; Listed Documents, etc_. If an item is disclosed in any
part of any Schedule and the existence of such item or its contents are
relevant to any other Schedule, then such item will be deemed to be disclosed
in such other Schedule to the extent such item or its contents would be
reasonably understood on its face to apply to the information called for by
such other

 



77  Schedule; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such disclosure shall be deemed
an admission as to the materiality of any item so disclosed.

 

10.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement will
become effective when duly executed by each Party hereto.

10.7. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any provision hereof
would, under applicable law, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, each
Party hereto intends that such provision will be construed by modifying or
limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible
with, and possible under, applicable law.

 

10.8. _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience
purposes only and will not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation
hereof.

10.9. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the rights of the Parties and all
Actions arising in whole or in part under or in connection herewith, will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic substantive laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other
jurisdiction.

10.10. _Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process_. 

10.10.1. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.5.5, each Party to this
Agreement, by its execution hereof, (a) hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of Delaware or the
United States District Court located in the State of Delaware for the purpose
of any Action between the parties arising in whole or in part under or in
connection with this Agreement, (b) hereby waives to the extent not prohibited
by applicable law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that any such Action brought in one of
the above-named courts should be dismissed on grounds of _forum
non conveniens_ , should be transferred or removed to any court other than
one of the above-named courts, or should be stayed by reason of the pendency
of some other proceeding in any other court other than one of the above-named
courts, or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be
enforced in or by such court and (c) hereby agrees not to commence any such
Action other than before one of the above-named courts. Notwithstanding the
previous sentence a party may commence any Action in a court other than the
above-named courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment
issued by one of the above-named courts.

10.10.2. Each Party agrees that for any Action between the Parties arising in
whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement, such Party agrees
to bring such Actions only in the State of Delaware. Each Party further
waives any claim and will not assert that venue should properly lie in any
other location within the selected jurisdiction.

 



 



78 10.10.3. Each Party hereby (a) consents to service of process in any Action
between the parties arising in whole or in part under or in connection with
this Agreement in any manner permitted by Delaware law, (b) agrees that
service of process made in accordance with clause (a) or made by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified
pursuant to Section 10.1, will constitute good and valid service of process in
any such Action and (c) waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as
a defense, or otherwise) in any such Action any claim that service of process
made in accordance with clause (a) or (b) does not constitute good and valid
service of process.

10.11. _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees
that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each of the
Parties agrees that, without posting bond or other undertaking, the other
Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Action instituted in
any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over
the parties and the matter in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled, at law or in equity. Each Party further agrees that, in the event of
any action for specific performance in respect of such breach or violation, it
will not assert that the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

10.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL
NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS
PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND
BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A
COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

10.13. _Conversion of Seller_. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
(i) at some point prior to the Closing, the Seller might convert into a
Delaware limited liability company, (ii) that nothing contained in this
Agreement prohibits such conversion and such conversion will not cause any
Seller Party to be in breach of any of the terms of this Agreement and (iii)
that the term "Seller" as defined herein, shall include the Seller, as so
converted.

 



79 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the undersigned has executed this Agreement as an
agreement under seal as of the date first above written.
