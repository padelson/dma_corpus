Price"):

 

(a)an amount of cash equal to (1) the Per Unit Portion of the Estimated

Note, plus

 

(b)an amount of cash equal to the Per Unit Portion of any Future Distribution
Amount, multiplied by the number of Common Units owned by Arsenal Blocker
immediately prior to the Blocker Closing.

 

1.03Closing. The closing of the Blocker Purchase shall take place on the
Closing Date immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Blocker Closing").

 

ARTICLE II

hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Company."

 

2.02Effective Time; Closing. At the Closing, the Company and Buyer and Merger
Sub shall cause a certificate of merger, in form and substance substantially
similar to Exhibit B attached hereto (the "Certificate of Merger") to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, and shall make all other filings or recordings required by the DLLCA
to complete the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such other time as Buyer and the Company shall agree and
shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").

 

2

   

2.03Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of DLLCA.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from
and after the Effective Time, all of the assets, property, rights, privileges,

Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Company.

 

2.04Certificate of Formation. The certificate of formation of Merger Sub in
effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of formation of the
Surviving Company until amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 

2.05Limited Liability Company Agreement. The limited liability company
agreement of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Company until amended in
accordance with applicable Law; provided that, such limited liability company
agreement shall at the Effective Time and through the end of the Closing Date
maintain the same economics and ownership of the Arsenal Company Units owned
by Arsenal Blocker as was maintained by the limited liability company
agreement of the Surviving Company immediately before the Effective Time.

 

2.06Managers and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed in accordance with applicable Law,
the managers and officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
managers and officers, as applicable, of the Surviving Company.

of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Parties or any of the Unitholders, the following
shall occur:

 

(a)Common Units. Each Common Unit outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Common Units to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.07(c), if any, and Arsenal Company Units) shall be cancelled and
extinguished and shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to:

to the Effective Time by the Company in treasury, if any, or held by Buyer or
any of its subsidiaries (excluding the Arsenal Company Units) shall be
cancelled and no cash or other consideration shall be paid with respect
thereto.

 

(d)Arsenal Company Units. The Arsenal Company Units shall remain outstanding
after the Effective Time. For greater certainty, there shall be no payments
made to Buyer or Arsenal Blocker in respect of the Arsenal Company Units and
each of Buyer and Arsenal Blocker hereby waives any and all rights to receive
any payments under this Agreement in respect of the Arsenal Company Units
after giving effect to the Blocker Purchase (including any right to payment of
the Arsenal Blocker Purchase Price to Arsenal Blocker Seller).

delivered prior to the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to each
Designated Unitholder a letter of transmittal in form and substance
substantially similar to Exhibit D attached hereto (the "Letter of
Transmittal"). The Letter of Transmittal shall approve the execution and
performance of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and approve the
appointment of the Representative and the Paying Agent. In the Letter of
Transmittal, each Unitholder shall release Arsenal Blocker, the Company and
its Subsidiaries from any claim such Unitholder may have for any and all
actions taken prior to the Effective Time by reason of the fact that such
Unitholder is or was an equityholder of Arsenal Blocker or the Company, as
appropriate.

 

(c)The Letter of Transmittal shall direct each Designated Unitholder to
deliver to the Paying Agent (with a copy to the Representative) a duly
completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal in accordance with the
instructions therein. If a Designated Unitholder delivers its duly completed
and validly executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent (with a copy to
the Representative) at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
then at the Closing the Paying Agent shall deliver to such Designated
Unitholder the portion of the Estimated Closing Cash Payment payable to such
Designated Unitholder pursuant to Sections 2.07(a)(i) and 2.07(b)(i), as
applicable, subject to any applicable withholding Tax requirements. If a
Designated Unitholder delivers its duly completed and validly executed Letter
of Transmittal to the Paying Agent (with a copy to the Representative) on or
after the second

 

4

   

(2nd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, then promptly after such
delivery, the Paying Agent shall deliver to such Designated Unitholder the
portion of the Estimated Closing Cash Payment payable to such Designated
Unitholder pursuant to Sections 2.07(a)(i) and 2.07(b)(i), as applicable, and,
if applicable, any Future Distribution Amount that such Designated Unitholder
is entitled to receive at that time, in each case subject to any applicable
withholding Tax requirements. From and after the Closing and until the Letter
of Transmittal is validly delivered, each such Company Unit shall represent
solely the right to receive the portion of the Transaction Consideration into
which the Company Unit shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.07,
without interest.

 

2.09Required Withholding. Each of Buyer, the Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent,
the Surviving Company (and any other Person that has any withholding
obligation with respect to any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or any
other agreements referenced herein) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement or any other agreements referenced herein such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; provided, that, except with
respect to payments in the nature of compensation to be made to employees or
former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if Buyer, the Escrow
Agent, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Company determines that an amount is
required to be deducted and withheld, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the payee, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
date the applicable payment is scheduled to be made, (a) with written notice
of the intent to deduct and withhold, which shall include a copy of the
calculation of the amount to be deducted and withheld and (b) a reasonable
opportunity to provide forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts
from withholding (or reduce such withholding). To the extent such amounts are
so deducted or withheld and remitted to the proper Taxing Authority, the
amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

 

2.10Indemnification Escrow. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Escrow Agent cash in an amount equal to the
Indemnification Escrow Amount. The Indemnification Escrow Amount will be held
and disbursed by the Escrow Agent solely for the purposes and in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

2.11Adjustment Escrow. At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Escrow Agent cash in an amount equal to the Adjustment
Escrow Amount. The Adjustment Escrow Amount will be held and disbursed by the

pursuant to Section 3.04(b) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement.

"Estimated Closing Statement") that sets forth a good faith estimate of the
Cash Amount, the outstanding amount of all Funded Debt as of immediately prior
to the Closing, the Transaction Expenses Amount, the Working Capital Surplus,
if any, and the Working Capital Deficit, if any, and based on such estimates,

Payment"). In addition, the Representative shall deliver to Buyer a
calculation, based on the Estimated Closing Cash Payment calculation delivered
by the Company, of the amounts payable at the Closing to Arsenal Blocker
Seller and each Designated Unitholder pursuant to Section 3.02(c).

 

(b)Final Calculations.

 

(i)Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Representative (A) a statement setting forth Buyer\'s good
faith calculation of (1) the Working Capital (and the Working Capital Surplus
or Working Capital Deficit, if any), (2) the Cash Amount, (3) the outstanding
amount of all Funded Debt as of immediately prior to the Closing, (4) the
Transaction Expenses Amount and (5) based on the amounts set forth in clauses
(1) through (4), the Closing Cash Payment (the "Closing Statement") and (B)
all records and work papers necessary to compute and verify the information
set forth in the Closing Statement. If Buyer does not deliver the Closing
Statement to the Representative within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,
then, at the election of the Representative (acting in its sole discretion),
either (x) the Representative may prepare and present the Closing Statement
within an additional thirty (30) days thereafter or (y) the Estimated Closing
Statement will be deemed to be the final Closing Statement in accordance with
this Section 3.04(b). If the Representative elects to prepare the Closing
Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,

 

8

   

then all subsequent references in this Section 3.04(b)(i) to Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Representative, on the other hand, will be deemed to be
references to the Representative, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, respectively. After delivery of the Closing Statement, the
Representative and its accountants and other representatives shall be
permitted to make inquiries of Buyer and the Company and their accountants and
other representatives regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the
Closing Statement arising in the course of their review thereof. If the
Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement, then the
Representative shall deliver to Buyer a statement (an "Objection Statement")
setting forth its disputes or objections (the "Objection Disputes") to the
Closing Statement and, to the extent practical, the Representative\'s proposed
resolution of each such Objection Dispute. If an Objection Statement is not
delivered to Buyer within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Closing
Statement by the Representative, then the Closing Statement as originally
received by the Representative shall be final, binding and non-appealable by
the Parties. If an Objection Statement is timely delivered, then Buyer and
the Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Objection
Disputes, but if they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Objection Statement, the Representative and Buyer
shall submit each unresolved Objection Dispute to Deloitte (the "Firm") to
resolve such Objection Disputes. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all
discussions related to the Objection Statement and any Objection Dispute are
without prejudice communications made in confidence with the intent of
attempting to resolve a litigious dispute and are subject to settlement
privilege. If Deloitte refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the Firm,
then Buyer and the Representative shall cooperate in good faith to appoint a
nationally recognized independent accounting or valuation firm mutually
agreeable to Buyer and the Representative, in which event "Firm" shall mean
such firm. The Firm shall be requested to render a written determination of
the unresolved Objection Disputes (acting as an expert and not as an
arbitrator) within forty-five (45) days following its retention, which
determination must be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the
basis therefore and must be based solely on (i) the definitions and other
applicable provisions of this Agreement, (ii) a single presentation (which
presentations shall be limited to the unresolved Objection Disputes) submitted
by each of Buyer and the Representative to the Firm within fifteen (15) days
after its retention (which the Firm shall forward to the other Party) and
(iii) one written response submitted to the Firm within fifteen (15) days
after receipt of each presentation (which the Firm shall forward to the other
Party) and not on independent review. Buyer and the Representative will
instruct the Firm not to, and the Firm will not, assign a value to any item in
dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on
the one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand, or less than the
smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the
Representative, on the other hand. The Firm\'s determination of such
Objection Disputes shall be final and binding upon the Parties and not subject
to review by a court or other tribunal. The terms of appointment and
engagement of the Firm shall be as reasonably agreed upon between Buyer and
the Representative, and any associated engagement fees shall initially be
allocated 50% to Buyer and 50% to the Representative; provided that such fees,
costs and expenses of the Firm will ultimately be allocated between Buyer, on
the one hand, and Representative, on the other hand, in the same proportion
that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Firm that
is unsuccessfully disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Firm)
bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted. For example, if the
Representative submits an adjustment of $1,000 for a specific item in the
Objection Statement, and if Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by
the Representative, and if

 

9

   

the Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Representative $300
of the $500 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Firm will be
allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to the
Representative. Except as provided in this clause (i), all other costs and
expenses incurred by the parties in connection with resolving any dispute
hereunder before the Firm shall be borne by the party incurring such costs and
expense. The final Closing Statement, however determined pursuant to this
Section 3.04(b), will produce the Working Capital Surplus or Working Capital
Deficit, if any, and the Cash Amount, the outstanding amount of all Funded
Debt as of immediately prior to the Closing and the Transaction Expenses
Amount, in each case to be used to determine the final Closing Cash Payment.
The process set forth in this Section 3.04(b) shall be the exclusive remedy of
the Parties for any disputes related to items required to be reflected on the
Closing Statement or included in the calculation of the Working Capital, the
Cash Amount, the outstanding amount of all Funded Debt as of immediately prior
to the Closing or the Transaction Expenses Amount, whether or not the
underlying facts and circumstances constitute a breach of any representations
or warranties.

 

(ii)If after the final determination pursuant to clause (i) above, the final
Closing Cash Payment is greater than the Estimated Closing Cash Payment, then
(x) Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days of
the final determination thereof) pay to the Paying Agent (for further
distribution to the Unitholders as provided herein) such difference by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such accounts designated by the
Representative and/or the Paying Agent (which amount shall be distributed by
the Paying Agent to the Unitholders based upon each such Unitholder\'s Per
Unit Portion, except as otherwise determined by the Representative in
accordance with Section 14.15) and (y) Buyer and the Representative shall
promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days of such final
determination thereof) deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written instruction
instructing the Escrow Agent to release the entire Adjustment Escrow Fund to
the Paying Agent (for further distribution to the Unitholders as provided
herein) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such accounts
designated by the Representative and/or the Paying Agent (which amount shall
be distributed by the Paying Agent to the Unitholders based upon each such
Unitholder\'s Per Unit Portion, except as otherwise determined by the
Representative in accordance with Section 14.15).

 

(iii)If after the final determination pursuant to clause (i) above, the
Estimated Closing Cash Payment is greater than the final Closing Cash Payment,
then Buyer and the Representative shall promptly (but in any event within five
(5) Business Days of the final determination thereof) jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to release to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such accounts designated by Buyer, the lesser of (x) the amount by
which the Estimated Closing Cash Payment is greater than the final Closing
Cash Payment, and (y) the amount of the Adjustment Escrow Fund.
Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, the Adjustment Escrow Fund
shall be Buyer\'s sole source of recovery for any adjustments to the Estimated
Closing Cash Payment or the Closing Cash Payment, even if the Estimated
Closing Cash Payment exceeds the final Closing Cash Payment by an amount that
is greater than the amount of the Adjustment Escrow Fund. If the amount
payable to Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.04(b)(iii) is less than the
Adjustment Escrow Fund, then Buyer and the Representative will (at the same
time that the Escrow Agent is instructed to release funds to Buyer pursuant to
this clause (iii)), execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written

 

10

   

instruction directing the Escrow Agent to pay the balance of the Adjustment
Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent (for further distribution to the Unitholders
as provided herein) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
accounts designated by the Representative and/or the Paying Agent (which
amount shall be distributed by the Paying Agent to the Unitholders based upon
each such Unitholder\'s Per Unit Portion, except as otherwise determined by
the Representative in accordance with Section 14.15).

 

3.05Preparation of Estimated Closing Statement and Closing Statement;
Cooperation.

 

(a)Preparation of Closing Statement. The Estimated Closing Statement and the
Closing Statement (and all calculations of Working Capital, Funded Debt and
the Cash Amount) shall be prepared and calculated in accordance with the same
accounting methodologies, principles and procedures used in, and on a basis
consistent with, those applied in preparing the Latest Balance Sheet
(including calculating reserves in accordance with the same methodology used
to calculate such reserves in preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet), except
that the Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement (and all
calculations of Working Capital, Funded Debt and the Cash Amount) shall: (i)
not include any purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the
consummation of the Transactions; (ii) be based on facts and circumstances as
they exist prior to the Closing and shall exclude the effect of any act,
decision or event occurring on or after the Closing; and (iii) not reflect,
directly or indirectly, any additional reserve or accrual that is not
reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet, except those that (A) result from
material developments occurring after the date of the Latest Balance Sheet and
(B) would be required to be reflected on the face of a balance sheet prepared
in accordance with the accounting methodologies, principles and procedures
used in, and on a basis consistent with, those applied in preparing the Latest
Balance Sheet or, in the event there was no applicable methodology, principle
or procedure used in the preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet, would be
required to be reflected on the face of a balance sheet prepared in accordance
with GAAP.

 

(b)Purpose of Closing Statement. The Parties agree that the purpose of
preparing the Closing Statement and calculating the Closing Cash Payment and
the components thereof is solely to assess the accuracy of the amounts
depicted in the Estimated Closing Statement and the calculation of the
Estimated Closing Cash Payment derived therefrom, and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, reserves classifications
or estimation methodologies for the purpose of calculating the Closing Cash
Payment than were used in the calculation of the Estimated Closing Cash
Payment.

 

(c)Cooperation. Following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective officers, employees,
consultants, accountants and agents to (i) cooperate fully with the
Representative and its accountants and other representatives in connection
with their review or preparation (as applicable) of the Closing Statement
and/or the Objection Statement (including by providing the Representative with
reasonable access to the employees of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries who are knowledgeable about the information contained in, and the
preparation of, the Closing Statement) and (ii) provide any books, records and
other information reasonably requested by the Representative and its
accountants or other representatives in connection therewith or in connection
with resolving any Objection Dispute, including during the period while any

 

11

   

unresolved Objection Disputes are being reviewed by the Firm and until a final
determination has been issued by the Firm.

5.15Tax Matters. 

 

(a)The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all material Tax Returns that
are required to be filed by them (taking into account any extensions of time
to file that have been duly perfected). All Taxes shown as owing by the
Company and its Subsidiaries on all such Tax Returns have been fully paid or
properly accrued, and all such Tax Returns are true and correct in all
material respects. All material Taxes that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is obligated to withhold from amounts owing to any employee,
creditor or third party have been fully paid or properly accrued. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently or, since January 1, 2015,

agreements with customers, vendors, lenders, lessors or the like entered into
in the ordinary course of business, (b) property Taxes payable with respect to
properties leased and (c) other agreements for which Taxes is not the

any item of income in, or exclude an item of deduction from, taxable income

provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law), (d) installment sale or

election under Section 108(i) of the Code. Except as set forth on Schedule
5.15(a), each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is, and has been since its
formation, properly treated as either a "partnership" or "disregarded entity"
for federal Income Tax purposes and no election has been made pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(c) to treat the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as an association taxable as a corporation. 

 

(b)The Company and its Subsidiaries have paid all sales Taxes required to be
paid by them.

Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the full benefit of all such insurance
policies. Since January 1, 2015, the Company and its Subsidiaries have timely
provided notice to all applicable carriers with respect to any claim, suit or
circumstance which would reasonably be expected to result in a material claim
in existence as of the Closing Date except where the failure to provide such
timely notice would not materially affect the ability of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as appropriate, from recovery with respect to such claim. Since
January 1, 2015, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries has received any
notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any of its Insurance Policies.

Buyer shall reasonably promptly update the Company and Arsenal Blocker Seller
in reasonable detail of any material developments concerning the status of the

Governmental Authority, in each case in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the

 

29

   

consummation of the Transactions and (ii) as promptly as practicable make all
necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with
respect to this Agreement required under any applicable Law, including the

Arsenal Blocker Seller and the Company shall, and Buyer shall cause its
Affiliates to, cooperate with each other in connection with obtaining all such
consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations, waivers, licenses,

as practicable objections, if any, asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and (ii) take all actions
necessary to obtain termination or expiration of the applicable waiting period

any other applicable antitrust Laws (collectively, the "Antitrust Conditions")

"End Date"), without challenge by any Governmental Authority (including by
opposing any motion or action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunction or order against or preventing or delaying the consummation of the
Transactions) and otherwise resolve any objections, if any, asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions,
including by divesting or holding separate any assets or voting securities,

agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner),
any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be

of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the

the lenders of a material breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or
termination or if any Person attempts or purports to terminate, cancel or
repudiate the Debt Commitment Letter, whether or not such attempted or
purported termination, cancellation or repudiation is valid by any party to
the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive documents relating to the Debt
Financing of which Buyer becomes aware that would reasonably be expected to
result in Buyer not receiving the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the
Closing Date or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter, (B) if and when
Buyer becomes aware that any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the

adversely impact

 

38

payments and/or benefits provided pursuant to the contracts or arrangements

confer upon any Continuing Employee (or any beneficiary thereof), any right,
benefit or remedy under or by reason of this Agreement, and no provision of

with all requirements of the WARN Act. Buyer and the Surviving Company will,
and will cause the Surviving Company\'s Subsidiaries to, comply with

 

42

Proc. 2011-29 (or corresponding state or local election) shall be made on the
applicable Tax Return for any success-based fees). Buyer shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries and Arsenal Blocker to timely file all Tax
Returns prepared pursuant to this Section 8.01.

 

43

   

8.02Pre-Closing Tax Matters. After the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall not permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Arsenal Blocker to, (a) other than Tax Returns that are
filed pursuant to Section 8.01, file or amend or otherwise modify any Tax
Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (b) after the date any Tax Return
filed pursuant to Section 8.01 is filed, amend or otherwise modify any such
Tax Return, (c) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, any
statute of limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax or
deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (d) make or change any Tax
election or accounting method or practice with respect to, or that has
retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (e) make or initiate any
voluntary contact with a Tax Authority (including any voluntary disclosure
agreement or similar process) regarding any Pre-Closing Tax Period. 

 

8.03Tax Proceedings. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Representative shall have the sole right in its discretion to elect to
represent (A) the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Arsenal
Blocker in any claim, audit, examination, or administrative or court
proceeding relating to any audits or assessments or other disputes regarding
any Taxes or any Tax Return filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries or
Arsenal Blocker with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including any
settlement or disposition thereof) ("Tax Proceeding"), if Buyer Indemnitees
could make a claim against the Indemnification Escrow Amount under this
Agreement with respect to such Tax Proceeding and (B) the interests of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and its direct and indirect owners in any claim,
audit, examination, or administrative or court proceeding relating to any
audits or assessments or other disputes regarding any Taxes or any Tax Return
filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods (including any settlement or disposition thereof) for any Pass-Through
Income Tax Matter (a "PT-Tax Proceeding"); provided, that Buyer shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Representative; provided,
further, that the Representative shall not consent to the entry of any
judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge any such claim, audit,
examination, or administrative or court proceeding without the prior written
consent of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) if such action would have the effect of increasing the present or
future Tax liability or decreasing any present or future Tax asset of the
Company and its Subsidiaries\' or Arsenal Blocker. After the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries and Buyer shall promptly notify the
Representative in writing upon receiving notice from any taxing authority of
the commencement of any such Tax Proceeding or PT-Tax Proceeding, and Buyer
shall take all action reasonably necessary (including providing a power of
attorney) to enable the Representative to exercise its control rights as set
forth in this Section 8.03. 

 

8.04Cooperation. Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries and Arsenal Blocker
and the Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other party, in connection with the preparation and filing of
Tax Returns pursuant to Section 8.01 and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes and the computation and verification of any
amounts paid or payable under Section 8.01 (including any supporting work
papers, schedules and documents). Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided

 

44

   

hereunder. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company or its
Subsidiaries relating to any Tax periods and shall abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and shall give
the Representative reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records prior to the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for that tax period, and if the
Representative so requests, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall allow the
Representative to take possession of such books and records rather than
destroying or discarding such books and records.

 

8.05No Code Section 338 or Section 336 Election. Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not make any election under Section 338 or 336 of the Code (or any
similar provision under state, local or foreign Law) with respect to the
acquisition of Arsenal Blocker pursuant to this Agreement.

 

8.06Tax Refunds. After the Closing Date, except to the extent (a) included as
an asset in Working Capital as finally determined hereunder, or (b)
attributable to the carryback of any loss from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, Unitholders shall be entitled to all Tax refunds (and
Overpayment Credits) received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, the Company
any of its Subsidiaries or Arsenal Blocker for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including any Tax refunds attributable to the carryback of items under
Section 8.07 below); provided that, any such amounts attributable to Arsenal
Blocker shall be for the sole benefit of Arsenal Blocker Seller. Buyer will
pay over to the Representative (for further distribution to the applicable
Unitholder(s)) any such Tax refund promptly (but in all cases within five (5)
Business Days) after actual receipt of such Tax refund (or, in the case of any
Overpayment Credits, promptly (but in all cases within five business days)
upon filing the applicable Tax Return where such Overpayment Credit is used to
reduce Taxes otherwise payable). To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Buyer shall request a refund (rather than a credit in lieu of a refund) with
respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

 

8.07Carrybacks. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns under
Section 8.01, FLX, Inc. and Arsenal Blocker shall elect to carry back any item
of loss, deduction or credit from the tax period ending on the Closing Date,
including any Transaction Tax Deductions, to prior taxable years to the
fullest extent permitted by law (using any available short-form or accelerated
procedures (including filing IRS Form 1139 and any corresponding form for
applicable state, local and foreign tax purposes) and filing amended Tax
Returns to the extent necessary) and to obtain any potential Tax refunds or
claims related thereto.

 

8.08Straddle Period. To the extent it is necessary for purposes of this
Agreement to determine the allocation of Taxes among a Straddle Period, Taxes
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Arsenal Blocker, as applicable, based
on or measured by income, gross or net sales, or payments or receipts shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date and any other Taxes shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period on a per diem basis.

 

8.09Closing of Tax Period. The Parties shall, to the extent permitted or
required under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last day of the
taxable period of the Company and

 

45

   

its Subsidiaries for all Tax purposes, and the Parties agree that the Company
shall be treated as terminated under Code Section 708(b)(1)(B). Buyer shall
cause Arsenal Blocker to join Buyer\'s "consolidated group" (as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(h)) effective on the day after the
Closing Date. The Parties agree that Buyer and its Affiliates and the Company
and its Subsidiaries (a) shall not make an election under Treasury Regulation
§1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) to ratably allocate items (or any make any similar
election or ratably allocate items under any corresponding provision of state,
local or foreign Law) and (b) shall not apply the "next day" rule of Treasury
Regulation § 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to any of the Transaction Tax
Deductions.

 

8.10Tax Treatment of Payments. All indemnification payments under ARTICLE XI,
any adjustment payments pursuant to Section 3.04, any payments of Tax refunds
pursuant to Section 8.06 will be deemed adjustments to the Closing Cash
Payment, unless otherwise required by Law.

 

8.11Allocation of Closing Cash Payment. For federal and applicable state
income tax purposes, Buyer and the Representative shall allocate the portion
of the Closing Cash Payment other than the Arsenal Blocker Purchase Price
(plus any applicable liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries) in
accordance with the allocation principles set forth on the Allocation Schedule
for purposes of determining the portion of the gain or loss recognized upon
the sale of the Company Units pursuant to the Merger that is attributable to
the Company\'s "unrealized receivables" and "inventory items" (as such terms
are defined in Section 751 of the Code). Neither Buyer nor the Representative
or any holder of Company Units, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall
take any position in any audits, tax returns or otherwise which is
inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do so by applicable Law
or good faith resolution of a tax contest.

ARTICLE XI 
SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

 

11.01Survival. All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
shall terminate and be of no further force and effect on the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the "Survival Period Termination
Date"). All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be
performed in whole at or prior to the Closing shall terminate upon the
Closing. All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement to be
performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit actions, subsequent to the
Closing Date, shall survive the Closing for the period specified therein.

 

11.02General Indemnification.

 

(a)Subject to the terms of this ARTICLE XI, and except for claims arising out
of fraud, from and after the Closing, Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing) and their
respective successors and assigns (the "Buyer Indemnitees") shall be entitled
to be indemnified solely from the Indemnification Escrow Fund (and not from
the Unitholders or any of their Affiliates) against any Losses arising out of
or resulting from any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of (i) the Company set forth in ARTICLE V, (ii) Arsenal Blocker
Seller set forth in Section 4.02, or (iii)

 

48

   

any breach by the Representative of any of its covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement that survive beyond the Closing Date.

 

(b)Subject to the terms of this ARTICLE XI, from and after the Closing, Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Unitholders and their respective heirs,
successors and assigns (the "Unitholder Indemnitees") from and against any
Losses arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of Buyer or Merger Sub set forth in Section
4.01, or (ii) any breach by Buyer, Merger Sub or the Surviving Company of any
of their respective covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that
survive beyond the Closing Date.

 

(c)The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to this Section
11.02 shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
for the applicable period set forth in Section 11.01, except for claims for
indemnification asserted by written notice to the Representative or Buyer, as
applicable, prior to the end of such applicable period (which claims shall
survive until final resolution thereof and so long as the party making such
claim is contesting such claim in good faith). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, except for claims arising out of fraud, all
claims for indemnification by any Buyer Indemnitee shall immediately terminate
and expire as soon as the Indemnification Escrow Funds available equal zero
dollars.

 

11.03Limitations on Indemnification Obligations. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the rights to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of Section 11.02 are subject to the following limitations.

 

(a)With respect to the matters described in Section 11.02(a), the aggregate
maximum amount of Losses recoverable by the Buyer Indemnitees shall not,
except in cases of fraud (claims for which shall be limited to the portion of
the Closing Cash Payment received by each of the Unitholders on a several and
not joint basis), exceed the Indemnification Escrow Fund then available (the
"Unitholder Cap"). 

 

(b)No indemnification under Section 11.02(a)(i) or Section 11.02(a)(ii) shall
be available unless and until the aggregate Losses of the Buyer Indemnitees
under such section exceed the Indemnification Deductible, in which case,
indemnification (solely from the Indemnification Escrow Fund) under such
section shall, subject to the Unitholder Cap and other limitations set forth
in this Agreement, be available for all Losses in excess of the
Indemnification Deductible; provided, however, that the Indemnification
Deductible shall not apply to Losses arising from breaches of a Fundamental
Representation or Section 5.15(b). Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 11.02(a)(i)
or Section 11.02(a)(ii), and no such claim by any Buyer Indemnitees shall be
so asserted, if the Losses relating to or resulting from such claim or other
claims relating to or resulting from the same facts, events or circumstances
are less than $50,000. For purposes of determining whether or not a breach of
a representation or warranty has occurred all qualifications or limitations as
to "materiality," "in all material respects" or "Material Adverse Effect" and
words of similar import set forth therein shall be taken into account, but for
purposes of determining Losses hereunder, all qualifications or limitations as
to "materiality," "in all

 

49

   

material respects" or "Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import
set forth therein shall be disregarded.

 

(c)No indemnification under Section 11.02(b)(i) shall be available unless and
until the aggregate Losses of the Unitholder Indemnitees under such section
exceed the Indemnification Deductible, in which case, indemnification under
such section shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, be
available for all Losses in excess of the Indemnification Deductible;
provided, however, that the Indemnification Deductible shall not apply to
Losses arising from breaches of a Fundamental Representation. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Unitholder Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification under Section 11.02(b)(i), and no such claim by any Unitholder
Indemnitees shall be so asserted, if the Losses relating to or resulting from
such claim or other claims relating to or resulting from the same facts,
events or circumstances are less than $50,000. For purposes of determining
whether or not a breach of a representation or warranty has occurred all
qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "in all material respects"
or "Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein
shall be taken into account, but for purposes of determining Losses hereunder,
all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "in all material
respects" or "Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth
therein shall be disregarded.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Buyer
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Losses to the extent
reflected or reserved for on the Financial Statements or included in the
calculation of any component of the Closing Cash Payment, including any Loss
that is included with as a Liability in the calculation of the Working
Capital, and (ii) the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no claim under this ARTICLE
XI to the extent arising from actions taken or not taken by the Buyer
Indemnitees, or any event or occurrence occurring, after Closing.

 

(e)The Parties acknowledge and agree that the same Loss may be subject to
indemnification under more than one subsection of Section 11.02; provided,
however, that, in no event shall the Unitholder Indemnitees, on the one hand,
or the Buyer Indemnitees, on the other hand, be entitled to duplicative
recoveries for the same underlying Loss.

 

(f)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer Indemnitees shall not have any
right to indemnification with respect to any environmental matter or
condition, including arising under Environmental Laws or relating to Hazardous
Materials, or any Losses relating thereto, to the extent that: (i) such matter
or condition is discovered or detected by any testing, sampling, or other
intrusive investigation or any reporting to any Governmental Authority, by or
on behalf of any Buyer Indemnitee, including at the Owned Real Property or
Leased Real Property, except to the extent such testing, sampling or other
intrusive investigation or reporting is (A) affirmatively required to comply
with Environmental Law or is directed to be conducted by a Governmental
Authority; or (B) necessary to comply with any legal requirements arising out
of a judicial order, suit or action or to comply with an order by a
Governmental Authority; (ii) arises from or relates to any maintenance,
removal or abatement of asbestos or asbestos-containing building materials
(other than such asbestos or asbestos containing material in friable form and
the condition of which as of Closing requires removal, abatement or
encapsulation by a Buyer Indemnitee to comply in all material respects with
Environmental Law); or (iii) is caused, accelerated or exacerbated in any
material respect by any act or omission by or on behalf of any Buyer

 

50

   

Indemnitee. Indemnification in favor of Buyer Indemnitees shall be limited to
such cost effective action that is reasonably necessary to achieve the minimum
applicable remedial standards allowable under Environmental Law for continued
industrial use of the relevant property or facility, employing where
applicable risk-based remedial standards, land use restrictions and
institutional controls, where such standards, restrictions or controls would
not unreasonably interfere with ongoing industrial or commercial operations at
the relevant property or facility.

 

(g)Buyer Indemnitees shall not have any right to indemnification under Section
11.02(a) or otherwise under this Agreement with respect to the representations
and warranties under Section 4.02(g) and Section 5.15 to the extent such
Losses or Taxes (i) are attributable to taxable periods (or portions thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) are due to the unavailability in any
taxable period (or portion hereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net
operating losses, credits or other Tax attribute from a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or (iii) that result
from the breach of the covenant in Section 8.02.

 

(h)The amount of any Loss shall be calculated net of any amounts recovered
under any insurance policies or from other collateral sources (such as
contractual indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this
Agreement). The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same
extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is received by
any Indemnified Party, in each case with respect to any Loss for which any
such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the amount
of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party that made or
directed such indemnification payments to such Indemnified Party.

 

(i)Prior to the Closing, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, none of the provisions of this ARTICLE XI shall apply to or
limit the Company\'s and the Unitholders\' right to recover from Buyer if
Buyer fails to consummate the Transactions.

 

11.04Matters Involving Third Parties.

 

(a)If any third party notifies any Party (the "Indemnified Party") of a matter
(a "Third Party Claim") which may give rise to a claim for indemnification
against any other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under this ARTICLE XI, then
the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing, describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable)
and the basis of the claim; provided, that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not limit the indemnification obligations under this
Agreement except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
such failure. 

 

(b)Any Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party\'s expense, and at its
option will have the right to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of the
Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will not be
entitled to assume the defense or prosecution of a Third Party Claim (unless

 

51

   

otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) if (i) the Third
Party Claim primarily relates to or arises from any criminal act; (ii) the
Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party as the primary element of such Third Party Claim; or (iii)
upon petition by the Indemnified Party, an applicable court rules that the
Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously defend or prosecute such
Third Party Claim; provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the
judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages and
does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Party, in which case no consent will be required; provided, further, that the
Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim (it being understood,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense and shall be
liable solely for the costs and expenses of counsel of its choice reasonable
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party). An Indemnified Party shall not settle
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or admit any liability
with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party. 

 

(c)The Indemnified Party (i) will not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), cause or agree to the waiver of the attorney-client
privilege, attorney work-product immunity or any other privilege or protection
in respect of confidential legal memoranda and other privileged materials
drafted by, or otherwise reflecting the legal advice of, internal or outside
counsel of an Indemnified Party (the "Subject Materials") relating to such
Third Party Claim and (ii) will cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in the review, investigation and defense of any such claim or any
related claim or counterclaim, shall make available its personnel, and shall
provide such testimony and access to its books and records as is reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith. In furtherance
of the foregoing, each Party mutually acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, that (1) each shares a common legal interest in
preparing for the defense of legal proceedings, or potential legal
proceedings, arising out of, relating to or in respect of any actual or
threatened Third-Party Claim or any related claim or counterclaim, (2) the
sharing of Subject Materials will further such common legal interest, and (3)
by disclosing any Subject Materials to and/or sharing any Subject Materials
with the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall not waive the
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product immunity or any other
privilege or protection. Except with respect to any sharing of Subject
Materials as permitted hereunder or as contemplated by any common interest
agreement or joint defense agreement entered into by the Parties, the
Indemnified Party shall not be required to make available to the Indemnifying
Party any information that is subject to an attorney-client or other
applicable legal privilege that based on the advice of outside counsel would
be impaired by such disclosure or any confidentiality restriction under
applicable Law; provided, however, that each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to permit the Indemnifying Party to become party to any
joint defense or common interest agreement entered into by an Indemnified
Party with any third Person.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following receipt by Buyer of (i) notice of a Third
Party Claim, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, retain documents
that are then within Buyer\'s or the

 

52

   

Company\'s possession or control and reasonably related to such Third Party
Claim for a period of time that the Representative reasonably determines, in
consultation with Buyer, after taking into account all relevant facts and
circumstances related to the Third Party Claim that is the subject of such
notice, or (ii) written notice by the Representative of a demand or inquiry by
a Governmental Authority, or subpoena or other legal process served by any
Person, relating to the Company, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to,
retain documents that are then within Buyer\'s or the Company\'s possession or
control and reasonably related to such information, demand or inquiry or such
subpoena or other legal process for the time period that the Representative
reasonably determines, in consultation with Buyer, after taking into account
all relevant facts and circumstances related to such information, demand or
inquiry.

 

11.05Mitigation. Each party entitled to indemnification shall, and shall
cause parties under its control to, take all reasonable steps to mitigate all
indemnifiable Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses hereunder, and no payment
shall be required to be made to an indemnitee for that portion of any such
Loss which is caused by or corresponds to any indemnitee\'s failure to comply
with its mitigation obligations under this Section 11.05.

 

11.06Exclusive Remedy.

 

(a)The Parties acknowledge and agree that, except as provided in Section
14.10, or except for claims relating to fraud, after the Closing, the
indemnification provisions in this ARTICLE XI shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parties and their Affiliates with respect to any claim related
to or arising from this Agreement or any certificate or other instrument
delivered pursuant hereto, the negotiation and execution of this Agreement,
the performance by the Parties of their respective obligations hereunder, and
the Transactions.

 

(b)Buyer agrees that, except for claims relating to fraud, the sole and
exclusive source of recovery and recourse for any money damage claims that any
Buyer Indemnitee may have related to or arising from this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be the recovery of amounts from the Indemnification Escrow
Fund and pursuant to the RandW Policy (subject to the terms of the RandW Policy).

of-pocket costs, and shall include the benefit of the bargain lost by such

value of money), which shall be deemed to be damages of such Party.

attached hereto), the Certificate of Merger, the Escrow Agreement, the Letters
of Transmittal and the certificates of the Parties delivered pursuant to
Section 3.03 (collectively, the "Transaction Documents"), contain the entire
understanding of the Parties in respect of their subject matter and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings (oral or written) between the Parties
with respect to such subject matter, other than the Confidentiality Agreement.
The Exhibits and Schedules constitute a part hereof as though set forth in
full above.

 

14.03Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties shall pay
their own fees and expenses, including their own counsel fees, incurred in
connection with this Agreement.

 

14.04Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may not be modified, amended,
supplemented, cancelled or discharged, except by written instrument executed
by Buyer, the Company and the Representative. No failure to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
power or privilege hereunder preclude the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. No waiver of any breach of any provision shall be deemed to be
a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any other
provision, nor shall any waiver be implied from any course of dealing between
the Parties. No extension of time for performance of any obligations or other
acts hereunder or under any other agreement shall be deemed to be an

 

72

   

extension of the time for performance of any other obligations or any other
acts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 14.04, 14.05, 14.08, 14.09,
14.10 and 14.18 shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse in any
respect to a Debt Financing Source without the prior written consent of such
Debt Financing Source.

 

14.05Binding Effect; Assignment. The rights and obligations of this Agreement
shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns. Nothing expressed or implied herein or therein shall
be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable rights hereunder.
Except as expressly provided herein, the rights and obligations of this
Agreement may not be assigned by the Parties hereto without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except for Sections 14.04, 14.05, 14.08, 14.09,
14.10, and 14.18, which are intended to benefit and to be enforceable by the
Debt Financing Sources (it being understood that the Debt Financing Sources
shall be third-party beneficiaries of such provisions); provided, that Buyer
and Merger Sub may, without the consent of any other party, assign their
rights hereunder for collateral security purposes to any Debt Financing Source
providing financing to Buyer.

 

14.06Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or electronic
mail transmission of a ".pdf" or other similar data file shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 

14.07Interpretation; Schedules. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an article, section, paragraph, clause, schedule or exhibit, such reference
shall be deemed to be to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Words
of one gender shall be held to include the other gender as the context
requires. The word "or" shall not be exclusive. The words "herein,"
"hereof," "hereunder" or "hereby" and similar terms are to be deemed to refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific section. The headings
contained herein and on the Schedules are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or
the Schedules. Unless otherwise specified herein, references to any statute,
listing rule, rule, standard, regulation or other law include a reference to
the corresponding rules and regulations and each of them as amended, modified,
supplemented, consolidated, replaced or rewritten from time to time.
References to any section of any statute, listing rule, rule, standard,
regulation or other law include any successor to such section. References to
any Contract (including this Agreement) or organizational document are to the
Contract or organizational document as amended, modified, supplemented or
replaced from time to time, unless otherwise stated, and any description of
any Contract, plan, instrument, document or other item set forth on a Schedule
is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of such
Contract, plan, instrument, document or other item. References to any Person
include such Person\'s predecessors or successors, whether by merger,
consolidation, amalgamation, reorganization or otherwise, and permitted
assigns. Any information set forth in one section of the Schedules will be
deemed to apply to other sections of the Schedules to the extent its relevance
to such other section is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure
(notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto). The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item

 

73

   

in the Schedules hereto is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher
or lower amounts, or the items so included, are or are not required to be
disclosed, and neither Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts
or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Schedules in any dispute
or controversy with any Party as to whether any obligation, item or matter not
described herein or included in a Schedule hereto is or is not required to be
disclosed (including, without limitation, whether such amounts or items are
required to be disclosed as material) or that the amounts, or higher or lower
amounts, or the items so included, are within or outside the ordinary course
of business. No information set forth in the Schedules will be deemed to
broaden in any way the scope of the Parties\' representations and warranties.

relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim.

 

(b)In addition, each Party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
in any Designated Court or any judgment entered by any of the Designated
Courts and hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any Proceedings

(c)EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE OUT
OF, OR WITH RESPECT TO, THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT, THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF AND THE DEBT FINANCING IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT

LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO

COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF
THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

14.10Specific Performance. Each of the Parties agrees that this Agreement is
intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its
terms and that Buyer, the Company and the Unitholders would be irreparably
harmed if any of the provisions of the Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms and that monetary damages would not
provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in addition to any other
remedy to which a non-breaching Party may be entitled at Law, a non-breaching
Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief without the posting of any bond
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions hereof. Each Party further waives any defense that a remedy at
Law would be adequate in any action or Proceeding for specific performance or

seek any remedy of specific performance or other equitable remedies directly
against any Debt Financing Source.

conditions and effects of this Agreement; said Party has relied solely and
completely upon its own judgment in executing this Agreement; said Party has
had the opportunity to seek and has obtained the advice of counsel before
executing this Agreement, which is the result of arm\'s length negotiations

that Arsenal Capital Partners LP and its Affiliates (collectively, the "ACP

and use such information in connection with enforcing their rights and
fulfilling their obligations under this Agreement or any other agreement

of the Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be issued or made by any Party
without the approval of the other Party, unless required by Law (in the
reasonable opinion of counsel) in which case the other Party shall have the
right to review such press release, announcement or communication prior to its
issuance, distribution or publication. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
Section 6.07, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the ability of any of
the ACP Entities from providing (i) the financial results achieved by any of
the ACP Entities with respect to their beneficial interest in the Company and
its Subsidiaries or (ii) a description of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including their financial performance, and the ACP Entities\' investment and

Transactions will be filed by the Buyer with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") within four Business Days of its execution. Buyer shall
provide the Company and its advisors with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the content of such filings with the SEC in advance of such
filings. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, none of
Buyer, the Company or the

Representative shall be prohibited from making any disclosures concerning this
Agreement or the Transactions to the extent that such disclosure recites
information consistent with prior public disclosures by Buyer.

 

14.15Designation of the Representative.

 

(a)Designation. ACP Flowchem LLC (the "Representative") is hereby designated
to serve as the representative of the Unitholders with respect to the matters
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement to be performed
by the Representative.

 

(b)Authority. The Representative is hereby irrevocably appointed as the
agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for each of the Unitholders for all purposes
of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and any
other agreement entered into in connection herewith (including the full power
and authority on such Person\'s behalf (i) to execute the Escrow Agreement and
the Paying Agent Agreement and otherwise to consummate the Transactions
(including the transactions contemplated in the Escrow Agreement and the
Paying Agent Agreement), (ii) to pay expenses incurred by such Person or the
Representative in connection with the marketing of the Company, the evaluation
of the Transactions and the negotiation and performance of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Paying Agent Agreement and any other agreement entered
into in connection herewith (whether incurred on or after the date hereof),
(iii) to calculate the Per Unit Portion for each Unitholder and any other
amounts payable to each Unitholder pursuant to this Agreement and instruct the
Paying Agent to disburse any funds received hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement to each other Unitholder, (iv) to
endorse and deliver any certificates or instruments representing the Company
Units and execute such further agreements or instruments of assignment as
Buyer shall reasonably request or which the Representative shall consider
necessary or proper to effectuate the Transactions, all of which shall have
the effect of binding the Unitholders as if such Unitholder had personally
executed such agreement or instrument, (v) to resolve any adjustments or
issues relating to any component of the Closing Cash Payment, (vi) to receive
notices and other deliverables hereunder on behalf of such Person, (vii) to
execute and deliver on behalf of such Person any amendment or waiver hereto or
to any other agreement contemplated hereunder, (viii) to take all other
actions to be taken by or on behalf of such Person in connection herewith
including under the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement, (ix) to
dispute, compromise, settle and pay any claims made in connection with this
Agreement, the Transactions (including the transactions contemplated in the
Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement), (x) to retain legal and
other professional advisors on behalf of, and at the expense of, the
Unitholders in connection with its actions hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement, (xi) to dispense funds from the
Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow Fund (or direct the
Escrow Agent to do so) to the Paying Agent on behalf of the Unitholders
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to retain from such funds an
amount sufficient to satisfy the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses or other
amounts incurred or payable by the Representative in fulfilling its
obligations hereunder, (xii) to make any calculations required under this
Agreement (including calculations with respect to the distribution of the
Transaction Consideration or each Unitholder\'s Unitholder Percentage of any
indemnification obligation), and (xiii) to do each and every act and exercise
any and all rights which such Person or the Unitholders are permitted or
required to do or exercise under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or the
Paying Agent Agreement. Such agency, proxy and

 

77

   

attorney-in-fact and all authority granted hereunder are coupled with an
interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Representative
and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or
liquidation of any Person. If, after the execution of this Agreement, any
Unitholder dies, dissolves or liquidates or becomes incapacitated or
incompetent, then the Representative is nevertheless authorized, empowered and
directed to act in accordance with this Agreement as if that death,
dissolution, liquidation, incapacity or incompetency had not occurred and
regardless of notice thereof. All decisions and actions by the Representative
shall be binding upon all of the Unitholders, and no Unitholder shall have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same.

 

(c)Representative Holdback. The Representative Holdback shall be withheld and
paid directly to an account maintained by the Representative (or a financial
institution selected by the Representative) as a fund for the fees and
expenses (including, without limitation, any legal fees and expenses) of
Arsenal Blocker Seller (whether or not in its capacity as the Representative)
incurred in connection with the marketing of the Company, this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement, the evaluation of the
Transactions, other actions taken by the Representative pursuant to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement, with any
balance of the Representative Holdback not utilized for such purposes to be
returned to the Unitholders in accordance with their Per Unit Portion. In the
event that the Representative Holdback shall be insufficient to satisfy the
fees and expenses of, and other amounts payable by, the Representative, and in
the event there are any remaining funds in the Escrow Amounts to be
distributed to the Paying Agent on behalf of the Unitholders immediately prior
to the final distribution from the Escrow Amounts to the Paying Agent on
behalf of the Unitholders pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Representative
shall be entitled to recover any such expenses from the Escrow Amounts to the
extent of such funds prior to the distribution of funds to the Unitholders.
The Representative shall also be entitled to recover any remaining expenses
directly from the Unitholders, and the Representative shall not have any
obligation to personally advance funds in connection with the performance of
any duties under this Agreement. 

 

(d)Authority; Indemnification. Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any action
taken by the Representative, on behalf of the Unitholders, pursuant to Section
14.15(b) (each, an "Authorized Action"), and each Authorized Action shall be
binding on each Unitholder as fully as if such Person had taken such
Authorized Action. Buyer agrees that the Representative, as the
Representative, shall have no liability to Buyer for any Authorized Action,
except to the extent that such Authorized Action is found by a final order of
a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted actual fraud. Each
Unitholder severally, for itself only and not jointly, will indemnify and hold
harmless the Representative against all expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by the Representative in connection with any action,
suit or Proceeding to which the Representative is made a party by reason of
the fact it is or was acting as the Representative pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

 

(e)Duties of the Representative. The Representative hereby accepts its
obligations under this Agreement. The Representative shall have only the
duties expressly stated in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Paying
Agent Agreement, and shall have no other duty, express or implied. The
Representative is not, by virtue of serving as Representative,

 

78

   

a fiduciary of the Unitholders or any other Person. The Representative, in
its capacity as such, has no personal responsibility or liability for any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company.

 

(f)Exculpation. The Representative shall not be liable to any Unitholder for
any action taken or omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or
under any other document entered into in connection herewith, except that the
Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by Law for
actual fraud. The Representative shall not be liable to the Unitholders for
any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Representative in
good faith, and, if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Person to whom
payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other Unitholders any
payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been
entitled. The Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry
concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the Representative nor
any agent employed by it shall incur any liability to any Unitholder by virtue
of the failure or refusal of the Representative for any reason to consummate
the Transactions or relating to the performance of its other duties hereunder,
except for actions or omissions constituting actual fraud.

 

(g)Letter of Transmittal. Any Unitholder that executes and delivers a Letter
of Transmittal pursuant to Section 2.08 will become a Party to this Section
14.15 and shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Section
14.15.

 

(h)No Fees to or Compensation of the Representative. The Representative shall
not be entitled to and shall not charge or collect from the Unitholders or any
other Person any fees or other compensation for its services as the
Representative under this Agreement. The Representative, however, shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the Unitholders (based on their Unitholder
Percentage of such expenses) for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with its services as the Representative under this
Agreement.

 

(i)Replacement of the Representative. If the Representative resigns or is
otherwise unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, then the Unitholders
that held a majority of the Common Units outstanding on the date hereof,
voting as a single class, will appoint a new Person to serve as the
Representative and will provide prompt written notice thereof to Buyer. Until
such notice is received, Buyer will be entitled to rely on the actions and
statements of the previous Representative.

 

14.16Company Representation. Each of the Parties hereby agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, managers, officers,
employees and Affiliates, (a) that Kirkland and Ellis LLP, Jones Day and
Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP have been retained by, and may serve as
counsel to, each and any of the Representative, the Unitholders and their
respective Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
(individually and collectively, the "Seller Group"), on the one hand, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Transactions, (b) that Kirkland and Ellis
LLP, Jones Day and Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP have not acted as
counsel for any other Party in connection with the Transactions and that none
of the other

 

79

   

Parties has the status of a client of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, Jones Day or
Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP for conflict of interest or any other
purposes as a result thereof, and (c) that, following consummation of the
Transactions, Kirkland and Ellis LLP, Jones Day or Honigman Miller Schwartz and
Cohn LLP (or any of their respective successors) may serve as counsel to the
Seller Group or any director, member, partner, manager, officer, employee or
Affiliate of any member of the Seller Group, in connection with any
litigation, action, suit, claim, investigation, proceeding or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions.
Notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each of the Parties (on their own behalf
and on behalf of their Affiliates) hereby consents thereto and knowingly,
willingly and irrevocably waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom,
and each of such parties will cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to
knowingly, willingly and irrevocably waive any conflict of interest arising
from such representation. Buyer, the Company and the Seller Group hereby
agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between
Buyer, the Company, and/or its Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Seller
Group or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, Kirkland and Ellis LLP,
Jones Day or Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP may represent the Seller
Group and/or such Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of the
Seller Group and/or such Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer, the
Company or its Subsidiaries, and even though Kirkland and Ellis LLP, Jones Day
or Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP may have represented the Company or
its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for Buyer, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries.
In addition, Buyer agrees that (x) all communications prior to the Effective
Time among any member of the Seller Group, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or
representatives, and Kirkland and Ellis LLP, Jones Day or Honigman Miller
Schwartz and Cohn LLP that relate to the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and closing under, or any dispute arising in connection with, this
Agreement, or otherwise relating to any potential sale of the Company or the
Transactions (the "Protected Seller Communications"), will be deemed to be
privileged and confidential communications, (y) all rights to such Protected
Seller Communications, the expectation of client confidentiality, and the
control of the confidentiality and privilege applicable thereto, belong to and
will be retained by the Seller Group and (z) to the extent Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing)
should discover in its possession after the Closing any Protected Seller
Communications, it will take reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality
thereof and promptly deliver the same to the Representative, keeping no
copies, and will not by reason thereof assert any loss of confidentiality or
privilege protection. As to any such Protected Seller Communications prior to
the Closing Date, Buyer, the Company, and each of its Subsidiaries together
with any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns,
further agree that none of the foregoing may use or rely on any of the
Protected Seller Communications in any action against or involving any of the
Seller Group, Kirkland and Ellis LLP, Jones Day or Honigman Miller Schwartz and
Cohn LLP after the Closing. The Protected Seller Communications may be used
by the Seller Group and/or any of their respective Affiliates in connection
with any dispute that relates in any way to this Agreement or the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and a third party other than the Seller Group (solely in their capacity as
equityholders of the Company or the Representative), on the other hand, the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates may assert the attorney-client
privilege with

 

80

   

respect to Protected Seller Communications to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications to such third party. Buyer, Merger Sub and the
Representative knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and
agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of each of their respective former,
current, or future Affiliates (including, in respect of Buyer, the Company and
its Subsidiaries (but solely after the Closing)), officers, directors,
employees, partners, members, equityholders, controlling or controlled
persons, managers, agents, representatives, successors, or permitted assigns,
that the agreements contained in this Section 14.16 (a) require performance
after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law and will
survive the Closing for twenty (20) years and will not be subject to any of
the survival or exclusive remedy provisions of ARTICLE XI; and (b) are an
integral part of the Transactions and that, without the agreements set forth
in this Section 14.16, neither party would enter into this Agreement and the
Company would not recommend approval of this Agreement to the Unitholders.

 

14.17Acknowledgements. The representations and warranties of the Company
expressly set forth in ARTICLE V of this Agreement and the representations and
warranties of Arsenal Blocker Seller expressly set forth in Section 4.02 of

deems necessary and appropriate, and has received all of the information that
it has requested from the Company and its Subsidiaries and Arsenal Blocker in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other

with Buyer\'s and Merger Sub\'s and their respective Affiliates\'

Person, or Buyer\'s or Merger Sub\'s use of, any such information, including
any information, document or material made available to Buyer, Merger Sub or
any other Person in certain "data rooms," management presentations or any
other form in expectation of the Transactions, and (ii) Buyer, Merger Sub and
such other Persons have not relied on any such information. Each Unitholder,
Arsenal Blocker, Buyer and Merger Sub further agree, on their own behalf and
on behalf of their respective Affiliates, agents and representatives, that
