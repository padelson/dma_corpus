Merger to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the "Secretary Of State") as provided in the DGCL and shall make all
other filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective on the date and time at which the Certificate
of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State or at such other date
and time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, and such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective

   (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL, except as otherwise provided herein. Subject to the
foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and be
subject to all of the obligations, restrictions, disabilities, liabilities,
debts and duties of the Company and Merger Sub.

SECTION 1.2.  Effect On Common Stock.   At the Effective Time:

   (a) Cancellation Of Shares Of Common Stock.  Each share of Common Stock held
by the Company as treasury stock and each share of Common Stock owned by Parent
or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall
be delivered therefor or in respect thereto. All shares of Common Stock to be
converted into Parent Shares pursuant to this Section 1.2 shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, cease to
be outstanding, be cancelled and retired and cease to exist; and each holder of
a certificate (representing prior to the Effective Time any such shares of
Common Stock) shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of Common Stock, except the right to receive (i) the Parent Shares into
which such shares of Common Stock have been converted, (ii) any dividend and
other distributions in accordance with Section 1.3(c) hereof and (iii) any
cash, without interest, to be paid in lieu of any fraction of a Parent Share in
accordance with Section 1.3(d) hereof.

   (b) Capital Stock Of Merger Sub.  Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares
so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

   (c) Conversion Of Shares Of Common Stock.  Subject to the other provisions
of Article I, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock referred to in
the first sentence of Section 1.2(a) hereof), together with the attached
Rights, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the fraction
(the "Exchange Ratio") of a Parent Share (calculated and rounded to the nearest
ten-thousandth of one share) equal to $10.00 (the "Share Price") divided by the
Parent Stock Price (as defined below). The "Parent Stock Price" shall be an
amount equal to the average closing sale price of one Parent Share, as reported
on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") Composite Transactions Tape for
the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on and including the third (3rd)
trading day prior to the date of the Company Stockholders' Meeting.

SECTION 1.3.  Exchange Of Certificates.

   (a) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement EquiServe Trust, N.A. or
such other bank, trust company, Person or Persons as shall be designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company shall act as the exchange agent
for the delivery of the Parent Shares in exchange for shares of Common Stock
(the "Exchange Agent") in connection with the Merger. At or promptly following
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent the certificates representing Parent Shares, for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Common Stock which are converted into Parent Shares
pursuant to Section 1.2(c) hereof (together with cash as required to (i) pay
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto in accordance with Section
1.3(c) hereof and (ii) make payments in lieu of fractional Parent Shares,
pursuant to Section 1.3(d) hereof, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Person" means any natural
person, firm, individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
association, joint venture, company, business trust, trust or any other entity
or organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, including a government
or political subdivision or any agency or instrumentality thereof.

   (b) As of or promptly following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or

                                      2

<PAGE>

certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Common Stock (the "Certificates"), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in the form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for a certificate or certificates representing that number of whole
Parent Shares, if any, into which the number of shares of Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to this Agreement (which instructions shall provide that at the election of the
surrendering holder, Certificates may be surrendered, and the Parent Shares in
exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery). Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the number of Parent Shares for each share of Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate (the "Merger Consolidation"), to be
mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) within three business days of receipt thereof (but in no
case prior to the Effective Time), and the Certificate so surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the
cash payable pursuant to Sections 1.3(c) and (d) below upon the surrender of
the Certificates.

   (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a
record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Parent Shares represented thereby
by reason of the conversion of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Sections
1.2(c) hereof and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.3(d) hereof until such
Certificate is surrendered in accordance with this Article I. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the Parent Shares
representing such securities are registered (i) at the time of such surrender,
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent Shares to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.3(d) hereof and the proportionate
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Parent Shares, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the
proportionate amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such Parent Shares.

   (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction of a
Parent Share will be issued and no dividend or other distribution, stock split
or interest with respect to Parent Shares shall relate to any fractional Parent
Share, and such fractional interest shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any rights as a security holder of the Parent Shares. In lieu of any such
fractional security, each holder of shares of Common Stock otherwise entitled
to a fraction of a Parent Share (after aggregating all fractional Parent Shares
that otherwise would be received by such holder) will be entitled to receive in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.3 from the Exchange Agent a
cash payment (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to
the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Stock Price.

   (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of the Certificates for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of shares of Common Stock
prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article I shall
thereafter look for payment of their claim, as general creditors thereof, only
to Parent (subject to Section 1.3(f) hereof) for their claim for Parent Shares,
any cash without interest, to be paid, in lieu of any fractional Parent Shares
and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares to which
such holders may be entitled.

   (f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Parent Shares held in the Exchange Fund
(and any cash, dividends and other distributions payable in respect

                                      3

<PAGE>

thereof) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior
to such earlier date on which (i) any Parent Shares, (ii) any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares or (iii) any dividends or distributions with respect
to Parent Shares in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Parent Shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

   (g) (i) The parties understand and agree that the Share Price has been
calculated based upon the accuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.4 and that, in the event the capitalization of the Company
as of the Closing Date is different than the capitalization of the Company as
set forth in Section 3.4 (other than as a result of the exercise or conversion
in accordance with their terms or the terms of this Agreement of any options,
warrants, securities or other agreements specifically set forth in Section 3.4,
including the ESPP), and that as a result of such difference the aggregate
dollar value (as determined below) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock,
Options, warrants and other securities exercisable or convertible into shares
of Common Stock (such Options, warrants and other securities being collectively
referred to as "Convertible Securities"), as of the Closing Date ((i) without
giving effect to the exercise or conversion of any Convertible Securities or
the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the ESPP as set forth in
Section 3.4, and (ii) including as a result of any stock split, stock dividend,
including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of
Common Stock, recapitalization, or other like change occurring after the date
of this Agreement) (the "Closing Capitalization") differs by an amount that is
greater than one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) of the aggregate dollar value (as
determined below) of the shares of Common Stock and Convertible Securities
calculated based on the capitalization of the Company as specifically set forth
in Section 3.4 (the "Represented Capitalization"), the Share Price shall be
adjusted (up or down, as applicable) by multiplying it by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Represented Capitalization and the denominator of
which is the Closing Capitalization. Any adjustment to the Share Price shall be
rounded to the nearest ten thousandth (1/10,000) of one cent.

   (ii) For purposes of calculating the aggregate dollar value of each of the
Closing Capitalization and the Represented Calculation, each share of Common
Stock shall equal the Share Price (except that, for purposes of calculating the
Closing Capitalization, each Convertible Security exercised or converted prior
to Closing shall be calculated as a Convertible Security as if it had not been
so exercised or converted, and the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to
the ESPP in accordance with its terms and as set forth in Section 3.4 shall be
calculated as if they had not been issued) and each Convertible Security shall
be calculated on the basis of the difference between (x) the exercise or
conversion price of such Convertible Security (if less than the Share Price)
and (y) the Share Price; and disregarding any Convertible Security with an
exercise or conversion price of equal to or more than the Share Price.

   (h) In the event that the Company shall obtain Interim Financing pursuant to
Section 7.4 hereof, and after giving effect to the adjustment of the Share
Price pursuant to Section 1.3(g) above, if any, the Share Price shall be
adjusted by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing
Capitalization and the denominator of which is the sum of the Closing
Capitalization and the Loan Adjustment Amount. Any adjustment to the Share
Price shall be rounded to nearest ten thousandth (1/10,000) of one cent. The
Loan Adjustment Amount shall be equal to the sum of:

      (i) one hundred percent (100%) of any Interim Financing up to $500,000
   (the "Base Amount") ;

      (ii) fifty percent (50%) of any Interim Financing provided pursuant to a
   Parent Loan or an Additional Financing (but excluding any Additional SVB
   Funds) above the Base Amount and up to one million dollars ($1,000,000); and

      (iii) one hundred percent (100%) of any Interim Financing in excess of
   one million dollars ($1,000,000).

   SECTION 1.4.  Transfer Taxes; Withholding.  If any certificate for a Parent
Share is to be issued to, or cash is to be remitted to, a Person (other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered), it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of the
Parent Shares (or cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares) to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Parent Shares (or cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Shares) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of shares of Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

SECTION 1.5.  Stock Options; Stock Purchase Plan; Warrants.

   (a) Stock Options.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary to provide that each employee,
consultant or director of the Company (each, an "Option Holder") who has been
granted an option to acquire shares of Common Stock ("Options") under the
Huckleberry 1993 Stock Option Plan (the "1993 Plan") or the Huckleberry
Director Option Plan (the "Director Plan," and together with the 1993 Plan, the
"Company Option Plans") which is outstanding at such time shall receive notice
(the "Notice"), in accordance with the provisions of the Company Option Plans,
that such Option, whether or not then exercisable, vested or unvested, is
exercisable for a period beginning on the date of Notice and ending on a date
specified in the Notice, which shall be no later than the Effective Time (the
"Exercise Period"). The duration of the Exercise Period shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of the Company Option Plan under which the
Option was granted, the exercisability of any such Option shall be contingent
upon the occurrence of the Merger (except in the case of an Option which is
already exercisable without regard to the accelerated exercisability provided
by the Notice) and the actual exercise of each such Option shall not occur
until immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Board of Directors of the
Company (or committee) shall also adopt procedures pursuant to which each
Option Holder may give notice to the Company during the Exercise Period of his
or her intent to exercise any such Option, including allowing for cashless
exercise by the Option Holders whereby Options would be converted to Common
Stock without payment of cash. At the Effective Time, all Exercise Periods
shall expire and all Options shall be terminated. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (i) the Company shall submit the form of all Notices to
be sent to each Option Holder to Parent and Merger Sub at least three (3)
business days prior to being sent to any such Option Holder for the prior
written approval of Parent and Merger Sub of such Notice (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld), and (ii) all Notices shall be delivered to each
Option Holder in such a manner as to confirm and provide evidence of receipt of
such Notice by each Option Holder.

   (b) Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  As of the earlier to occur of (i) May 31,
2002 and (ii) the last day of a regular payroll period of the Company ending
prior to the Closing Date (the "ESPP Date"), all offering and purchase periods
under way under the Company's 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP")
shall be terminated and each participant's ESPP option shall be exercised
automatically on such ESPP Date. As of the date of this Agreement, no new
offering or purchase periods shall be commenced under the ESPP. The Company
shall take all necessary action, including providing all required notices to
participants, to ensure that the rights of participants in the ESPP with
respect to any such offering or purchase periods shall be determined by
treating the ESPP Date as the last day of such offering and purchase periods.
The Company shall freeze, effective as of the date of this Agreement, existing
participation levels of each participant under the ESPP and accept no new
participants.

                                      5

   (c) Warrants.  At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume each warrant to
purchase Common Stock then outstanding as set forth on Section 3.4(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Company Warrant") in accordance with the
terms (as in effect as of the date hereof) of such Company Warrants. From and
after the Effective Time, (a) each Company Warrant assumed by Parent may be
exercised solely for Parent Shares, (b) the number of Parent Shares subject to
each Company Warrant shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole share
(with cash, less the applicable exercise price, being payable for any fraction
of a share), (c) the per share exercise price under each such Company Warrant
shall be equal to the per share exercise price under such Company Warrant
divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounding up to the nearest whole cent and (d)
any restriction on the exercise of any Company Warrant shall continue in full
force and effect and the term, exercisability and other provisions of such
Company Warrant shall otherwise remain unchanged. The Company shall take all
action that may be necessary (under the Company Warrants and otherwise) to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.5(c) and to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, holders of Company Warrants have no rights with
respect thereto other than those specifically provided herein.

   SECTION 1.6.  No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock.  All Parent
Shares issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.3(d) hereof) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Common
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, at any time following the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

   SECTION 1.7.  Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the execution of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Parent Shares to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this Article I.

   SECTION 1.8.  Merger Closing.  Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Philadelphia time, on a date to be
specified by the parties hereto, and no later than the second business day
after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof, at the offices of Parent at One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, IL 60015
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto (such date, the "Closing Date").

   SECTION 1.9.  Tax Consequences.  It is intended by the parties hereto that
the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368
of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the
United States Income Tax Regulations. The parties (i) acknowledge that,
following the Merger, Parent intends to cause the Surviving Corporation to
merge with and into a wholly-owned first-tier subsidiary of Parent (the
"Follow-On Merger"), and (ii) intend that the Merger and such Follow-On Merger
shall be viewed an integrated transaction qualifying as a reorganization for
federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

                                  ARTICLE II

                           THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

   SECTION 2.1.  Certificate Of Incorporation.  At the Effective Time, the

Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such
Certificate of

                                      6

<PAGE>

Incorporation of the Company, as so amended and restated, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Fusion Medical
Technologies, Inc."

   SECTION 2.2.  Bylaws.  The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable law, the certificate of incorporation of such
entity and the bylaws of such entity.

SECTION 2.3.  Officers And Directors.

   (a) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Company, until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly appointed in accordance with applicable law and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of such entity.

   (b) The Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation effective as of, and

of incorporation and bylaws of such entity.

                                  ARTICLE III

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

   The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to
such exceptions as are specifically disclosed in writing in the disclosure
schedule supplied by the Company to Parent. The disclosure schedule shall
provide an exception to or otherwise qualify the representations or warranties
of Company specifically referred to in such disclosure and such other
representations and warranties to the extent such disclosure shall reasonably
appear to be applicable to such other representations or warranties (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule") as follows:

   SECTION 3.1.  Corporate Existence And Power.  The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, and has all corporate powers and all governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents, franchises, permits and approvals (collectively,
"Licenses") required to carry on its business as now conducted except for
failures to have any such License which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions where failures to be so
qualified would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used herein, the term
"Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect, event, occurrence,
state of facts or development that, individually or in the aggregate, is
materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets
(including intangible assets), properties or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taking the Company and its Subsidiaries together
as a whole; provided, however, that none of the following shall be deemed in
and of themselves, either alone or in combination, to constitute, and none of
the following in and of themselves shall be taken into account in determining
whether there has been or will be, a Company Material Aderse Effect: (a) any
change in the market price or trading volume of the Company's stock after the
date hereof, in and of itself; (b) any failure by the Company to meet internal
projections or forecasts or published revenue or earnings predictions for any
period ending (or for which revenues or earnings are released) on or after the
date of

                                      7

<PAGE>

this Agreement, provided, however, that the reasons for any such failure may be
taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be a Company
Material Adverse Effect; (c) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence,
state of facts or development to the extent attributable to the announcement or
pendency of the Merger (including any cancellations of or delays in customer
orders, any reduction in sales, any disruption in supplier, distributor,
partner or similar relationships or any loss of employees); (d) any adverse
change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development attributable
to conditions generally affecting (i) the industries in which the Company
participates, including actions by the FDA or Foreign Authorities, (ii) the
U.S. economy as a whole or (iii) foreign economies in any locations where the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has material operations or sales, which
changes, effects, events, occurrences, state of facts or developments in the
case of (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence do not disproportionately affect
the Company in any material respect; (e) any adverse change, effect, event,
occurrence, state of facts or development attributable to the product risks
disclosed on the inserts enclosed with the Company's products as of the date of
this Agreement; or (f) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of
facts or development attributable to any action by the FDA or Foreign
Authorities (i) to reclassify thrombin-containing devices as biologicals, or
(ii) to the extent resulting from or related to the filing of the letter
pursuant to Section 5.17.

SECTION 3.2.  Corporate Authorization.

   (a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and, subject to approval of the Company's
stockholders as set forth in Section 3.2(b) hereof and as contemplated by
Section 5.3 hereof, to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of
its obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized, and
this Agreement has been approved, by the Board of Directors of the Company and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, except the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and constitutes, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law).

   (b) Under applicable law, the current Certificate of Incorporation and
bylaws of the Company and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on
the record date, established by the Board of Directors of the Company in
accordance with the bylaws of the Company, applicable law and this Agreement,
is the only vote of any class or series of capital stock of the Company or its
Subsidiaries required to approve and adopt this Agreement.

SECTION 3.3.  Consents and Approvals; No Violations.

   (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the performance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder, nor the consummation by the Company of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or violate any
provision of the current Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws (or other
governing or organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be; (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration or
obligation to repurchase, repay, redeem or acquire or any similar right or
obligation or loss of a benefit, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
properties or assets of the Company) under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, letter of credit,
other evidence of indebtedness, guarantee, license, lease or agreement or
similar instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their assets may be
bound or (iii) assuming that the filings, registrations, notifications,

of ERISA), employment contracts, bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred
compensation, incentive compensation, excess benefit, stock, stock option,
severance, termination pay, change in control or other employee benefit plans,
programs or arrangements, including those providing medical, dental, vision,
disability, life insurance (including any policy under which an employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is named as insured, and as to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes premium payments, whether or not the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is the owner, beneficiary or both, of such
policy) and vacation benefits (other than those required to be maintained by
law), whether written or unwritten, qualified or unqualified, funded or
unfunded, foreign or domestic, currently maintained or contributed to, or
required to be maintained or contributed to, by the Company, any Subsidiary or
any ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employees,
officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
(collectively, the "Benefit Plans"). As applicable with respect to each Benefit
Plan, the Company has made available to Parent, true and complete copies of (i)
each Benefit Plan, including all amendments thereto, and in the case of an
unwritten Benefit Plan, a written description thereof, (ii) all trust
documents, investment management contracts, custodial agreements and insurance
contracts relating thereto, (iii) the current summary plan description and each
summary of material modifications thereto, (iv) the three most recent annual
reports (Form 5500 and all schedules thereto) filed with the Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS"), (v) the most recent IRS determination letter and each
currently pending application to the IRS for a determination letter, (vi) the
three most recent summary annual reports, financial statements and trustee
reports, and (vii) all records, notices and filings concerning IRS or
Department of Labor audits or investigations, "prohibited transactions" within
the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and "reportable
events" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained, contributed to or ever had any
liability (whether direct, indirect, contingent or otherwise) with respect to
any plan which is or has been subject to Title IV of ERISA (including any
"multiemployer pension plans" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. "ERISA
Affiliate" means (A) any corporation which at any time on or before the Closing
Date is or was a member of the same controlled group of corporations (with the
meaning of Section 414(b) of the Code) as the Company; (B) any partnership,
trade or business (whether incorporated or not incorporated) which at any time
on or before the Closing Date is or was under common control (within the
meaning of Section 414(c) of the Code) with the Company; and (C) any entity
which at any time on or before the Closing Date is or was a member of the same
affiliated service group (within the meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code) as
either the Company, any corporation described in clause (A) or any partnership,
trade or business described in clause (B) of this paragraph.

   (b) No event has occurred and, to the knowledge of the Company, there exists
no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate could be subject to any
liability under the terms of any Benefit Plan, under ERISA, or, with respect to
any Benefit Plan, under the Code or any other applicable law, rule or
regulation, domestic or foreign, other than any condition or set of
circumstances that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or
would reasonably be expected to incur any liability in respect of any employee
benefit plan maintained by an ERISA Affiliate but not included within the term
"Benefit Plan" or by any Person other than the Company, its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA Affiliate.

   (c) The Benefit Plans which are "employee pension benefit plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA are intended to meet the qualification
requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code (each a "Pension Plan") and the
related trusts are intended to meet the requirements for such qualification,
and the Company has no knowledge of any events or circumstances that would
compromise such qualified status. All Pension Plans have received determination
letters (or have remaining a period of time under applicable Treasury
regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter) from the
IRS to the effect that such Pension Plans are

                                      14

<PAGE>

qualified and the related trusts are exempt from federal income taxes and no
determination letter with respect to any Pension Plan has been revoked nor, to
the knowledge of the Company is there any reason for such revocation, nor has
any Pension Plan been amended, or failed to be amended, since the date of its
most recent determination letter in any respect which would adversely affect
its qualification.

   (d) Section 3.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists: (i) the amount
of any unfunded deferred compensation and (ii) the present value of any
obligation to provide medical, or to the knowledge of the Company, life
insurance benefits to any retiree determined in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 106. For the purposes of this Section 3.12(d)
unfunded liabilities and projected costs have been determined using actuarial
methods and assumptions that are, individually and in the aggregate, reasonable.

   (e) No prohibited transaction (which shall mean any transaction prohibited
by Section 406 of ERISA and not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA) nor any
fiduciary breach has occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan which would
result in the imposition, directly or indirectly, of any penalty or excise tax
under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) or Section 502(l) of ERISA
that would, individually or in the aggregate, have, or reasonably be expected
to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

   (f) Except as set forth on Section 3.12(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or as set forth in Section 1.5 of this Agreement, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein will not (i) require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate to pay greater compensation or make a larger
contribution to, or pay greater benefits or accelerate payment or vesting of a
benefit under, any Benefit Plan or any other program, agreement, policy or
arrangement or (ii) create or give rise to any additional vested rights or
service credits under any Benefit Plan or any other program, agreement, policy
or arrangement.

   (g) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate is a party to or is bound by any severance agreement, program or
policy.

   (h) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(h) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Benefit Plan provides benefits, including medical benefits, beyond
termination of employment or retirement other than (A) coverage mandated by law
or (B) death or retirement benefits under a Benefit Plan qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or
any ERISA Affiliate is contractually or otherwise obligated (whether or not in
writing) to provide any person with life, medical, dental or disability
benefits for any period of time beyond retirement or termination of employment,
other than as required by the provisions of Sections 601 through 733 of ERISA
and Sections 4980B, 9801 and 9833 of the Code.

   (i) With respect to any Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit
plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), (i) no such Benefit Plan is funded
through a "welfare benefit fund," as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of
the Code, (ii) each such Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan," as such
term is defined in Section 5000(b)(l) of the Code, complies in all material

   (n) Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.

   (i) Section 3.12(n) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and

      (1) Non-U.S. Benefit Arrangements into which the Company or its
   Subsidiaries have entered (other than the benefit arrangements required by
   national or state law), including all benefit arrangements required on an
   industry wide basis as well as legally required benefit arrangements which
   were implemented to avoid affiliation to a national or industry wide plan.
   For purposes of the foregoing, "Benefit Arrangements" means all
   arrangements, whether written or verbally agreed, on a group or individual
   basis, whether funded or not, which grant a retirement, death,
   hospitalization, medical, dental, disability or long service recognition
   benefit to any employee, former employee, or director.

   subsidiaries have entered. For purposes of the foregoing, "Remuneration
   Plans" includes, but is not limited to, base salary, bonuses, incentive

   indemnities and any form of plans maintained by the Company or its
   Subsidiaries which provide stock, phantom stock, or stock appreciation

   employees.

      (3) Plans and commitments, whether legally binding or not, to create any
   additional plan or modify or change any existing Benefit Arrangement or
   Remuneration Plan, that would affect any plan beneficiary (such formal plans
   and commitments will collectively be referred to as the "Commitments to
   change Benefit Arrangements or Remuneration Plans").

   (ii) The Company has made available to Parent (a) true and complete copies
of all material documents and material relating to the Benefit Arrangements and
Remuneration Plans or the Commitments to change Benefit Arrangements or
Remuneration Plans, all amendments to the Benefit Arrangements and Remuneration

Remuneration Plan or Commitment to change Benefit Arrangement or Remuneration
Plans.

   (iii) Except as specifically set forth in Section 3.12(n) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, all the Benefit Arrangements which are intended, to the
extent allowable, to obtain tax exemption on contributions, benefits and/

                                      16

<PAGE>

or invested assets under the appropriate legislation, to the Company's
knowledge, meet, and since their inception have met, the requirements for such
tax exemption under the appropriate legislation. Since their inception, these
plans have been exempt from taxation to the extent allowable by the appropriate
legislation. To the Company's knowledge, the tax exemption of the Benefit
Arrangements is not the subject of examination or pending cancellation. Each
Benefit Arrangement has been operated in all material respects in accordance
with its provisions and in compliance with the statutes, rules and regulations
governing each such Benefit Arrangement, including rules and regulations
promulgated by the appropriate government departments and other statutorily
empowered bodies. To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that
could subject any party to the imposition of any penalty. There has been no
failure to act on the part of the Company, a Benefit Arrangement, a fiduciary
or a mandated custodian of any Benefit Arrangement that could subject any party
to the imposition of a penalty. For purposes of this paragraph, (a) "any party"
means the Company, Parent, a Benefit Arrangement, a fiduciary or a mandated
custodian of a Benefit Arrangement, (b) "any penalty" means any material tax,
penalty or other liability, whether by way of indemnity or otherwise.

   (iv) Each Benefit Arrangement has been maintained in compliance with the
minimum funding standards of the appropriate legislation. No such Benefit
Arrangement has incurred any funding deficiency as defined by the appropriate
legislation, whether or not waived. The Company has not sought nor received a
waiver of funding requirements with respect to any Benefit Arrangement. With
respect to each Benefit Arrangement, the benefits to be provided under such
plan which have accrued in accordance with applicable legislation on or prior
to Closing Date have been paid and/or properly reflected on the books and
records and other financial reports of the Company. With respect to each
Benefit Arrangement and Remuneration Plan, the benefits to be provided under
such Plans have been accrued in accordance with GAAP, and that lack of
materiality has not been used as a reason to omit accruals. Other than as
contemplated under Section 1.5 of this Agreement, the execution of, and
performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not
constitute an event under any Benefit Arrangement or Remuneration Plan that
will or may result in any payment, acceleration, vesting or increase in
benefits with respect to any Plan beneficiary.

   (o) In addition to, and not in limitation of, the more specific
representations set forth in the preceding provisions of this Section 3.12, to
the knowledge of the Company each Benefit Plan has been maintained and
administered by the Company, each of its Subsidiaries and their respective
agents in material compliance with ERISA and all applicable laws.

knowledge of the Company threatened against, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, assets, interest or rights
or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to indemnify a
third party before any court or arbitrator or any Governmental Entity which
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There
is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court or arbitrator or

or prohibit the transactions contemplated herein or to impose any material
liability in connection therewith as to which there is a reasonable probability

rendered, would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations of any Governmental Authority

   SECTION 3.18.  Board Recommendation.  The Board of Directors of the Company,
at a meeting duly called and held on February 26, 2002, has approved this

contemplated hereby, including the Merger, taken together are fair to and in
the best interests of the stockholders of the Company and declared the Merger
to be advisable; (ii) approved this Agreement; and (iii) resolved to recommend

   (a) The Company has taken all action necessary to render the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
affiliates, and to the Merger and this Agreement. The Board of Directors of the
Company has approved the Merger and this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. No other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination," or other state takeover statute or

Merger, this Agreement, or any of the other transactions contemplated in this
Agreement, or to Parent or Merger Sub in connection therewith.

   (b) The Company has approved all amendments, if any, necessary or
appropriate so that the Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated as of October
10, 1997, between the Company and EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as most
recently amended on April 11, 2001 (the "Rights Plan"), is inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, do not

such term is defined in the Rights Plan), (ii) result in the ability of any
Person to exercise any rights under the Rights Plan, (iii) enable or require
the "Rights" (as such term is defined in the Rights Plan) to separate

                                      22

<PAGE>

triggered or become exercisable, or (iv) otherwise result in the occurrence of
a "Distribution Date" or "Share Acquisition Date" (as such terms are defined in
the Rights Plan).

   SECTION 3.22.  Insurance.  The Company and its Subsidiaries each currently
maintains insurance in amounts reasonably sufficient to insure against the
risks usually insured against by companies of similar size operating similar
businesses at similar stages of development. As of the date of this Agreement,

interest in any property, which is for taxes not yet due and payable or has

                                  ARTICLE IV

            REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

   Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the
Company, as follows:

   SECTION 4.1.  Corporate Existence And Power.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, has all corporate power, as the
case may be, and all Licenses required to carry on its business as now
conducted except for failures to have any such License which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where
failures to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As used
herein, the term "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect,
event, occurrence, state of facts or development that, individually or in the
aggregate, is materially adverse to the business condition (financial or
otherwise), assets (including intangible assets), properties or results of
operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taking Parent and its Subsidiaries
together as a whole, provided, however, that none of the following shall be
deemed in and of themselves, either alone or in combination, to constitute, and
none of the following in and of themselves shall be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or will be, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect: (a) any change in the market price or trading volume of Parent's stock
after the date hereof, in and of itself; (b) any failure by Parent to meet
internal projections or forecasts or published revenue or earnings predictions
for any period ending (or for which revenues or earnings are released) on or
after the date of this Agreement, provided, however, that the reasons for any
such failure may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or
will be a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (c) any adverse change, effect,
event, occurrence, state of facts or development to the extent attributable to
the announcement or pendency of the Merger; or (d) any adverse change, effect,
event, occurrence, state of facts or development attributable to conditions
generally affecting (i) the industries in which Parent participates, (ii) the
U.S. economy as a whole or (iii) foreign economies in any locations where
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has material operations or sales, which
changes, effects, events, occurrences, state of facts or developments in the
case of (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence do not disproportionately affect
Parent in any material respect.

   SECTION 4.2.  Corporate Authorization.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by Parent and
Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub, by Parent as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and this Agreement has been approved by the
Board of Directors of Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, a valid
and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against
each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

SECTION 4.3.  Consents and Approvals; No Violations.

   (a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the performance
by each of Parent and Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder, nor the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby,
will (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or other governing or organizational documents) of
Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, or (ii) result in a

                                      26

<PAGE>

violation or breach of, constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time
or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration or obligation to repurchase, repay, redeem or acquire or any
similar right or obligation, or loss of a benefit or result in the creation of
any Lien upon any properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub) under any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any loan or credit agreement, note,
mortgage, letter of credit, other evidence of indebtedness, guarantee, license,
lease or agreement or similar instrument or obligation to which any of Parent
or Merger Sub is a party or by which any of them or any of the respective
assets used or held for use by any of them may be bound or (iii) assuming that
the filings, registrations, notifications, authorizations, consents and
approvals referred to in Section 4.3(b) below have been obtained or made, as
the case may be, violate any order, injunction, decree, statute, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity to which either Parent or Merger Sub is
subject, excluding from the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii) such requirements,
defaults, breaches, rights or violations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of either Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

   (b) No filing or registration with, notification to, or authorization,
consent, order or approval of, any Governmental Entity is required in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent
and Merger Sub or the performance by any of them of their respective
obligations hereunder, except (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with the DGCL and filings to maintain the good standing of the
Surviving Corporation; (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the
HSR Act or any applicable foreign antitrust, laws or laws intended to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade and any filings and consents which may be required by any
foreign environmental, health or safety laws or regulations pertaining to any
notification, disclosure or required approval triggered by the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; (iv)
compliance with any applicable requirements of state blue sky or takeover laws
and (v) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, notifications,
registrations, declarations and filings the failure of which to be obtained or
made would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect and would not have a material adverse
effect on the ability of either Parent or Merger Sub to perform their
respective obligations hereunder.

capital stock of Parent consisted of 100,000,000,000 Parent Shares and

non-assessable and free of preemptive rights with respect thereto.

statements, registration statements, forms and other documents (the "Parent SEC
Documents") required to be filed with the SEC since January 1, 2000 pursuant to
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. As of their respective dates, and giving effect to any
amendments thereto, (a) the Parent SEC documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and (b) none of the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to

individually or in the aggregate, material in amount).

   SECTION 4.7.  Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus.  None of
the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein

   SECTION 4.10.  Tax Treatment.  Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has

stockholders of the Company, disclosing information or affording access with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries in response to an unsolicited
request therefor, or participating or engaging in discussions or negotiations,
in each such case regarding an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, if, and only to the extent that (1) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have concluded in good faith, after considering

                                      32

<PAGE>

applicable law and the advice of outside legal counsel knowledgeable in such
applicable law (who may be the Company's regularly engaged outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable law and (2) prior to taking such action the Company (x) delivers to
Parent the notice required pursuant to Section 5.5(c) stating that it is taking
such action, and (y) receives from such Person or group an executed
confidentiality agreement that is not less restrictive as to such Person or
entity than the Confidentiality Agreement and that contains standstill
restrictions which are not less restrictive as to such Person or entity than
those contained in the letter agreement, dated as of January 14, 2002, by and
between the Company and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, as amended.

   As used herein, "Acquisition Proposal'' means any offer or proposal
regarding any of the following (other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) involving the Company: (i) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, business combination or
other similar transaction; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other disposition of twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of any Material Business
or of any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company responsible for a Material
Business, in a single transaction or series of related transactions; (iii) any
tender offer (including a self tender offer), exchange offer or other
transaction that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group
beneficially owning more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of
any class of equity securities of the Company (or in the case of a Person or
group which beneficially owns more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding
shares of any class of equity securities of the Company as of the date hereof,
would result in such Person or group increasing the percentage or number of
shares of such class beneficially owned by such Person or group by more than
five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of such class); or (iv) any
acquisition of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company.

   As used herein, a "Superior Proposal'' means an Acquisition Proposal
involving the acquisition of all of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding
or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
having received the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be more favorable to the Company and the holders of Common Stock
(taking into account all financial and strategic considerations, including
relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and
the third party making such proposal and the conditions and prospects for
completion of such proposal) than the transactions contemplated herein taken as
a whole (taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement that
have been proposed by Parent in response to such proposal).

   As used herein, "Material Business'' means any business (or the assets
needed to carry out such business) that contributed or represented twenty
percent (20%) or more of the net sales, the net income or the assets (including
equity securities) of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

   (b) Except as permitted by this Section 5.5, neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, amend, change,
modify or fail to make, or publicly propose to withdraw, amend, change, modify
or fail to make, its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, (ii) approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) take any action to render the provisions of any anti-takeover
statute, rule or regulation inapplicable to any Person or group (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or their affiliates) or to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iv)
cause the Company to accept any Acquisition Proposal and/or enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement'') related to any
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the requisite vote of the stockholders of the
Company, the Board of Directors of the Company may take any of such actions if,
and only to the extent that (A) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
concluded in good faith, after considering applicable law and the advice of
outside legal counsel knowledgeable in such applicable law (who may be the
Company's regularly engaged outside legal

                                      33

<PAGE>

counsel) that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable law, and (C) in the case of any action set forth in clause (iv)
above, the Company shall, prior to or simultaneously with the taking of such
action, (x) have paid or pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee
referred to in Section 7.3, and (y) have complied with its obligations under
Section 7.1(g) and (D) the Company is not in breach of this Section 5.5.

   (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs
(a) and (b) above, the Company shall promptly (and in any event, within 48
hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of the executive officers of the
Company receiving any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or request for
information with respect to, or which could reasonably be expected to lead to
the Company receiving or otherwise becoming aware of any Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request, and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request and the Company's response or responses thereto. The Company
will keep Parent reasonably fully informed of the status and details (including
material amendments or modifications) of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry
or request. The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing (other than Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their affiliates or Representatives).

   (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third
party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or from making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders required by
applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, the approval or recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Company of the Merger unless and until the Company and the
Board of Directors of the Company have complied with this Section 5.5.

   (e) The Company agrees not to release any third party from, or waive any
provision of, any standstill agreement to which the Company is a party.

   (f) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Section 5.5 to the contrary,
the Company may, at any time after the date that is ninety (90) days after the
date hereof, upon delivery of written notice to Parent, solicit, initiate and
encourage, or participate or engage in discussions or negotiations solely
regarding, or provide non-public information or afford access in connection
therewith, any Person providing equity and/or debt financing to the Company not
to exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in the aggregate; provided: (i)
that such Person does not conduct operations in the biotechnology, biosurgery,
medical device, pharmaceutical or related industries (or is not "controlled" by
any such entity, as such term is defined in Rule 405 of the regulations
promulgated under the Securities Act); (ii) the Company reasonably believes
that such Person will be providing such financing for passive investment
purposes and not with a view of effecting any transaction that could constitute
an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) the Company shall not enter into any contract,
agreement or arrangement in respect of any such proposed equity issuance; and
(iv) prior to engaging in any such discussions or negotiations, or providing
any such non-public information or affording any such access, the Company shall
have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such Person or Persons that
(A) includes a representation from such Person that it is providing such
financing for passive investment purposes and not with a view of effecting an
Acquisition Proposal, and (B) contains terms that are not materially less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided, further, that the Company shall notify Parent upon entering into any
confidentiality agreement described in clause (iv).

SECTION 5.6.  Director and Officer Liability.

   (a) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and all
limitations on liability existing in favor of any Indemnitee as provided in the
current Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any agreement
between an Indemnitee and the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company as in
effect as of the

                                      34

<PAGE>

date hereof, and as set forth on Section 3.15 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

   (b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who on or
prior to the Effective Time were officers, directors, employees or agents of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnitees'') to the same extent
as set forth in Section 5.6(a) above. In the event any claim in respect of
which indemnification is available pursuant to the foregoing provisions is
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
shall continue until such claim is disposed of or all judgments, orders,
decrees or other rulings in connection with such claim are fully satisfied.

   (c) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
provide officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person
currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance
policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in
no event will the Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an
annual premium for such coverage in excess of one hundred and seventy five
percent (175%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company.

   (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 5.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.6 applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.6 applies shall be third party beneficiaries
of this Section 5.6) unless such modification or termination is required by law.

   SECTION 5.7.  Commercially Reasonable Efforts.   Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, each party hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

SECTION 5.8.  Certain Filings.

   (a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in
connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form
S-4, (ii) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required, or any actions, consents, approvals
or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts,
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) in seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers
or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith or with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 and seeking
timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. Without
limiting the provisions of this Section 5.8, each party hereto shall file with
the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission a Pre-Merger
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby within ten (10) days after the date of this
Agreement, and each party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take
or cause to be taken all actions necessary, including to promptly and fully
comply with any requests for information from regulatory Governmental Entities,
to obtain any clearance, waiver, approval or authorization relating to the HSR
Act that is necessary to enable the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the provisions of this Section
5.8, each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly make the filings required to be made by it with all foreign
Governmental Entities in any jurisdiction in which the parties believe it is
necessary or advisable.

   (b) The Company and Parent shall each use its commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement under any
Antitrust Law. If any administrative, judicial or legislative action or
proceeding is instituted (or

                                      35

<PAGE>

threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, the Company
and Parent shall each cooperate to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, including by pursuing all reasonable avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, shall be
required (and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, agree, but shall, if so directed by Parent, agree) to hold separate or
divest any of their respective assets, businesses or operations (or any
material part, portion or category thereof) or enter into any consent decree or
licensing or other arrangement with respect to any of their assets, businesses
or operations (or any material part, portion or category thereof).

   (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other party of
any material communication received by such party from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other
governmental or regulatory authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

   (d) The Company shall give and make all required notices to the appropriate
Persons with respect to the consents and approvals set forth in Section 3.3 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, except where such notices are required by the
appropriate Persons to be given by Parent or Merger Sub. Subject to the other
terms of this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to make all
filings, to obtain all actions or nonactions, waivers, Permits and orders of
Governmental Entities as shall be necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and to take all reasonable steps as shall be necessary to
obtain any approvals or waivers as shall be required from, or to avoid any
actions or proceedings by, any Governmental Entity. Each of the parties hereto
will furnish to the other parties such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing.

   (e) The Company and its Board of Directors (i) shall take all action
necessary to ensure that Section 203 of the DGCL does not become applicable to
the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
shall take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that no other state
takeover statute or similar statute, rule or regulation is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated
hereby. If any state takeover statute or similar statute, rule or regulation
becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement, or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, the Company and its Board of Directors shall take all
action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   (f) "Antitrust Law'' means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, and all other federal, state and foreign statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines, and other laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate competition or actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade.

   SECTION 5.9.  Public Announcements.  Neither the Company, Parent nor any of
their respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement
or the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consultation
with the other party, provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit any
party, following notification to the other party, from making any disclosure,
as may be required by law or by any listing agreement with, or the policies of,
a national securities exchange.

   SECTION 5.10.  Further Assurances.  At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or

                                      36

<PAGE>

Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and
do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation, as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

SECTION 5.11.  Employee Matters.

   (a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, give individuals who are
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time and
who remain employees of the Company or such Subsidiary following the Effective
Time (each such employee, an "Affected Employee'') full credit for such
Affected Employees' service with the Company for purposes of vacation accrual
under Parent's vacation policy to the extent each such Affected Employee has
been credited with service under the Company's vacation policy immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall offer Affected Employees the
opportunity to elect to participate in Parent's Incentive Investment Plan as
soon as administratively feasible following the date on which such Affected
Employees are transferred to Parent's payroll.

   (b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide (or shall cause the
Company to provide) benefits to the Affected Employees that are substantially
similar (including salary, health and welfare benefits and 401(k) plan
participation), taken as a whole, to the benefits currently provided to
employees of Parent performing functions similar to those to be performed by
such Affected Employees after the Effective Time.

effectuate (a) a "plant closing" as defined in the WARN Act affecting any
single site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within

qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code

hereof, and neither party will take any action inconsistent therewith.

any of the conditions specified in Article VI not being satisfied. The delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.15 shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty of the party giving such notice contained in this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder.

   SECTION 5.16.  No Redemption of Rights Plan.  Subject to Section 5.5,
between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not (a) redeem, amend or
waive any provisions of the Rights Plan (other than as set forth in Section
3.21 solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
but not with respect to any Acquisition Proposal), except to the extent the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have concluded in good faith, after
considering applicable law and the advice of outside legal counsel
knowledgeable in such applicable law (who may be the Company's regularly
engaged outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable law, or (b) implement or adopt any so
called "poison pill," shareholder rights plan or other similar plan. Within
five (5) business days of the date hereof, the Company shall amend the Rights
Plan as required under Section 3.21(b).

   SECTION 5.17.  Request for Designation.  Within fifteen (15) days of the

Company, may be deemed to have become an affiliate (as such term is used under
Rule 145 of the Securities Act) of the Company after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time, to deliver, to Parent, at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the Effective Time, an affiliate letter in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A to this Agreement (the "Affiliate Letter"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled to place legends as specified in the
Affiliate Letter on the certificates evidencing any of the Parent Shares to be
received by any Person identified on Section 3.29 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer
agent for such Parent Shares, consistent with the terms of the Affiliate Letter.

   shall be true in all respects as of such earlier date), except (i) as
   otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) for such

   representations and warranties);

      (c) The Company shall have received certificates signed by any senior

   reasonable representations as may be requested by tax counsel in connection
   with the opinions referred to above;

   SECTION 7.1.  Termination.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated by this

      (a) by the mutual consent of the Company, Merger Sub and Parent in a
   writing duly authorized by the Board of Directors of each party;

      (b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Closing has not been
   consummated by August 26, 2002, or such other date, if any, as the Company
   and Parent shall agree upon, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by
   such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this
   Agreement to perform or observe its covenants or agreements set forth herein;

      (c) by either the Company or Parent, if there shall be any applicable law
   or regulation that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated by
   this Agreement illegal or if any judgment, injunction, order or decree
   enjoining Parent, Merger Sub or the Company from consummating the
   transactions contemplated by this Agreement is entered and such judgment,
   injunction, order or decree shall have become final and nonappealable;

      (d) by either the Company or Parent, if the adoption of this Agreement by
   the stockholders of the Company shall not have been obtained at a duly held
   meeting of stockholders of the Company called for that purpose or any
   adjournment thereof;

      (e) by Parent if the Company has, or by the Company, if Parent or Merger
   Sub has, in any material respect, breached (i) any covenant or agreement
   contained herein or (ii) any representation or warranty contained herein,
   and in either case if (x) to the extent such breach is capable of being
   cured, such breach has not been cured by the earlier of twenty (20) days
   after the date on which written notice of such breach is given to the party
   committing such breach or the Effective Time and (y) such breach would
   entitle the non-breaching party not to consummate the transactions
   contemplated hereby under Article VI hereof;

      (f) by Parent, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (or any
   committee thereof) shall have withdrawn, amended, changed, modified in a
   manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or failed to make, the
   recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company referred to in
   Section 3.18, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee
   thereof) shall have recommended to the stockholders of the Company any
   Acquisition Proposal or shall have publicly announced an intention to do so,

   stockholders or (B) within ten (10) business days of such commencement, the
   Board of Directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) shall have
   failed to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange
   offer by its stockholders, (iv) the Board of Directors of the Company shall

<PAGE>

   recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company referred to in
   Section 3.18 within ten (10) business days after Parent requests in writing
   that such recommendations be reaffirmed at any time following the date on
   which it is publicly announced or the Company otherwise discovers that any
   person or group (which includes a "person" or "group" as such terms are
   defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), including by filing a
   Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act, other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of
   their affiliates, or any group of which any of them is a member and other
   than passive stockholders reporting their holdings on Schedule 13G, shall
   have acquired beneficial ownership of more than twenty percent (20%) of the
   outstanding shares of Common Stock, or (v) the Company shall have breached
   the provisions of Section 5.5 of this Agreement in any material respect; or

      (g) by the Company, for the purpose of accepting a Superior Proposal;
   provided, that such termination under this Section 7.1(g) shall not be
   effective unless (i) the Company and its Board of Directors shall have
   complied with all their obligations under Section 5.5(b) and the Company
   shall have paid the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3; (ii) the
   Company provides the Parent with at least three (3) business days' prior
   written notice prior to terminating this Agreement, which notice shall be
   accompanied by (x) a copy of the proposed acquisition agreement with respect
   to the Superior Proposal that the Company proposes to accept, and (y) the
   Company's written certification that it has made the determinations with
   respect to such Superior Proposal set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of the
   proviso in Section 5.5(b), and the irrevocable representation that the
   Company will, in the absence of any other superior Acquisition Proposal,
   execute such Acquisition Agreement unless Parent modifies this Agreement
   such that the Company's Board of Directors reasonably believes in good faith
   after consultation with its independent legal counsel and financial advisors
   that the Merger (as so modified) is at least as favorable as such Superior
   Proposal.

   The party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall give written notice of
such termination to the other party.

   SECTION 7.2.  Effect of Termination.  Except for any willful breach of this
Agreement by any party hereto (which willful breach and liability therefor
shall not be affected by the termination of this Agreement or the payment of
any Termination Fee), if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1
hereof, then this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no
liability on the part of any party hereto; provided, however, that
notwithstanding such termination the agreements contained in Sections 5.4(b),
7.2, 7.3 and 8.7 hereof shall survive the termination hereof.

to clause (i) of Section 7.1(e) hereof in the event of an intentional or
willful breach of this Agreement by the Company, where such breach is intended
to facilitate, assist or otherwise benefit, or such breach has the effect,
directly or indirectly, of facilitating or assisting or otherwise benefiting,
an Acquisition Proposal or the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, and if
(i) the Company shall have received an Acquisition Proposal from any person or
group which shall not have expired or been revoked prior to such termination of
this Agreement and (B) within nine (9) months after such termination an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive
agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not involving such
Person or group) which is subsequently consummated, then the Company shall pay
to Parent the Termination Fee within five (5) business days after consummation
of such transaction (by check or wire transfer of same day funds).

<PAGE>

   (d) Except as provided otherwise in this Section 7.3, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the
Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and the Company shall

pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 7.4 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (such additional financing, if provided by Parent, being
referred to as the "Parent Loan," if provided by the Company's existing lender,
being referred to as the "Additional SVB Funds," and if provided by any other
party, being referred to as the "Additional Financing," and shall collectively
be referred to herein as the "Interim Financing"). Promptly after execution of
this Agreement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Parent Loan within thirty (30) days of the date hereof on the
principal terms and conditions set forth on Section 7.4 of the Company

   SECTION 8.2.  Survival Of Representations And Warranties.  The
representations and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time. All
other covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms are to be
performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit actions, subsequent to the
Effective Time, shall survive the Merger in accordance with their terms.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such representations, warranties or covenants
shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive the Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company (or any director, officer or controlling Person
thereof) of any defense in law or equity which otherwise would be available
against the claims of any Person, including any shareholder or former
shareholder of either the Parent or the Company, the aforesaid representations,
warranties and covenants being material inducements to the consummation by the
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company of the transactions contemplated herein.

   SECTION 8.3.  Interpretation.  References herein to the "knowledge of the
Company" shall mean the actual knowledge of the executive officers of the
Company, provided that such Persons shall have duly inquired of those officers,
managers or Representatives of the Company who are responsible for or would
reasonably be expected to have actual knowledge of the matters represented.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The phrase "made available" when used in this Agreement shall mean
that the information referred to has been made available if requested by the
party to whom such information is to be made available. As used in this
Agreement, the term "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

   The article and Section headings contained in this Agreement are solely for
the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the parties hereto
and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Any matter disclosed pursuant to the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission or
representation as to the materiality of the item so disclosed.

SECTION 8.4   Amendments, Modification And Waiver.

   (a) Except as may otherwise be provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended, modified or waived by the parties hereto, by action
taken by or duly authorized by their respective Board of Directors, prior to
the Closing Date if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company and Parent or, in the case
of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided
that after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company,
no such amendment shall be made except as allowed under applicable law.

   (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the

                                      43

<PAGE>

exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law.

   SECTION 8.5.  Successors And Assigns.  The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns; provided that neither the Company nor Parent
may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto.

   SECTION 8.6.  Specific Performance.  The parties acknowledge and agree that
any breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm
for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy, including Section 7.3
hereof, and accordingly the parties agree that, in addition to any other
remedies, each shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a
decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy
of money damages as a remedy.

   SECTION 8.7.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof) as to all matters, including matters of validity,
construction, effect, performance and remedies.

   SECTION 8.8.  Severability.  If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner.

   SECTION 8.9.  Third Party Beneficiaries.  This Agreement is solely for the
benefit of the Company and its successors and permitted assigns, with respect
to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement, and for the
benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, with respect to the obligations of the Company under this Agreement,
and this Agreement shall not, except to the extent necessary to enforce the
provisions of Article I and Section 5.6 hereof be deemed to confer upon or give
to any other third party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of
action or other right.

   SECTION 8.10.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, including any exhibits or
schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes all other prior agreements or understandings, both written and
oral, between the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

   SECTION 8.11.  Counterparts; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

                                      44
