and together with Fund V and Associates V, the "LENDERS"), AmSan, LLC, a

the rights, preferences and obligations specified in the Amended and Restated
Operating Agreement of the Company, dated as of June, 2005, by and among the
Company and the Parent (the "LLC AGREEMENT").   C. As a condition to the
Buyer\'s obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, on or
prior to the Closing Date the Company and the Parent will have consummated
the Excluded Assets Transaction.   D. The Buyer desires to acquire, and the
Parent desires to sell, all of the LLC Interests on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.   E. The board of directors of
the Parent has approved this Agreement and the related transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL (as defined
below).   AGREEMENTS   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which
is hereby acknowledged, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound
hereby, agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE TRANSACTION   1.1. PURCHASE
OF SECURITIES. Subject to the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at
the Closing, the Buyer shall purchase from the Parent, and the Parent shall
sell to the Buyer, the LLC Interests, free and clear of all Encumbrances,
and, in exchange therefor, the Buyer shall, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, pay the Closing Payment set forth    in SECTION 1.1.2 of
this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Parent
in the manner described in SECTION 2.2(a)(III) of this Agreement.   1.1.1.
For purposes of this Agreement, (a) the term "TARGET NET WORKING CAPITAL
AMOUNT" means $31,000,000, and (b) the term "NET WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT"
means the number (positive or negative) calculated on the basis of Net
Working Capital as follows: (i) if the Net Working Capital exceeds the Target
Net Working Capital Amount by more than $1,000,000, then the Net Working
Capital Adjustment is a positive number equal to the amount by which the Net
Working Capital exceeds $32,000,000; (ii) if the Net Working Capital exceeds
the Target Net Working Capital Amount by $1,000,000 or less, if the Target
Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Net Working Capital by $1,000,000 or
less, or if the Net Working Capital is equal to the Target Net
Working Capital Amount, then the Net Working Capital Adjustment is zero (0);
and (iii) if the Target Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Net Working
Capital by more than $1,000,000, then the Net Working Capital Adjustment is a
negative number equal to the amount by which $30,000,000 exceeds the Net
Working Capital.   1.1.2. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"CLOSING PAYMENT" means (a) $127,500,000.00 (the "BASE CONSIDERATION"), MINUS
(b) the amount of the Estimated Indebtedness, PLUS (c) the Estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment based on Estimated Net Working Capital (it being
understood that if the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment is a negative
number, its net effect shall be for it to be subtracted from the Base
Consideration in the calculation of the Closing Payment, i.e., the addition
of a negative number), MINUS (d) the Escrow Amount, PLUS (e) the amount of
the Estimated Cash in excess of zero, MINUS (f) the amount of Estimated Cash
less than zero, MINUS (g) the amount of the Estimated Transaction Expenses,
MINUS (h) the aggregate amount of the Estimated Closing Date Incentive Award
Payments, MINUS (i) the aggregate amount of the Lease Escrow Amount.   1.2.
CLOSING CALCULATIONS. Not less than three (3) business days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer its good
faith calculation (the "CLOSING STATEMENT") of its estimate of (a) Cash (the
"ESTIMATED CASH"), (b) Indebtedness (the "ESTIMATED INDEBTEDNESS"), (c) Net
Working Capital (the "ESTIMATED NET WORKING CAPITAL") and the estimated Net
Working Capital Adjustment (the "ESTIMATED NET WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT"),
(d) Transaction Expenses ("ESTIMATED TRANSACTION EXPENSES"), (e) Closing Date
Incentive Award Payments ("ESTIMATED CLOSING DATE INCENTIVE AWARD PAYMENTS"),
and (f) its estimate of the Lease Escrow Amount. The Parties shall negotiate
in good faith any disagreement with respect to all of the items set forth on
the Closing Statement, provided that if the Company and the Buyer cannot
agree on Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness or Estimated Net
Working Capital, such estimates shall be deemed to be equal to the amount
thereof set forth on the Latest Balance Sheet, or if approved by the Company
and the Buyer, the latest balance sheet then available; PROVIDED FURTHER that
the Company\'s estimate of the Lease Escrow Amount shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Buyer. In connection therewith, the Company shall deliver
to the Buyer payoff letters for the Indebtedness reflected on SCHEDULE 1.2 of
the Disclosure Schedules (with it being understood that such payoff letters
shall release any rights a holder of Indebtedness may have with respect to
the equity interests of the Company (including with respect to amending the
limited liability company agreement of the Company)) (the "PAYOFF LETTERS"),
and wire transfer instructions for the payment of the Estimated Indebtedness,
Estimated   2   Transaction Expenses and Estimated Closing Date Incentive
Award Payments set forth in the Closing Statement.   1.3. CLOSING BALANCE
SHEET CALCULATION.   1.3.1. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
the Buyer will deliver to the Parent an unaudited balance sheet of the
Company as of the Closing (the "CLOSING BALANCE SHEET") and a statement
showing a calculation of Cash, Net Working Capital, Net Working Capital
Adjustment, Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and Closing Date Incentive
Award Payments, all reflecting consummation of the Excluded Assets
Transaction (such calculations together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the
"PRELIMINARY STATEMENT"). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared and
Cash, Net Working Capital and Net Working Capital Adjustment shall be
determined (including, without limitation, for purposes of SECTION 1.2) in
accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
estimation methodology as were used in preparation of the audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Parent as of the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2005 (the "2005 BALANCE SHEET") or, to the extent
applicable, in accordance with any changes to such accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices and procedures that are documented in the
Company\'s and the Parent\'s books and records as of December 31, 2005 (and
disclosed to the Buyer in SCHEDULE 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedules), and
shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of
purchase accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as
a consequence of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than
the Excluded Assets Transaction); and the calculation of Indebtedness,
Transaction Expenses and Closing Date Incentive Award Payments shall be
prepared in accordance with this Agreement. The parties agree that
the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and determining the Cash,
Net Working Capital and Net Working Capital Adjustment and the related
purchase price adjustment contemplated by this SECTION 1.3 is to measure the
amounts of Cash, Net Working Capital and Net Working Capital Adjustment, and
such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different
judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of
preparing the Closing Balance Sheet or determining Cash, Net Working Capital
and Net Working Capital Adjustment. After delivery of the Preliminary
Statement, the Parent and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable
access during normal business hours of the Company and upon reasonable notice
to appropriate Company personnel and to review the Company\'s books and
records and work papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary
Statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Parent shall not use or permit to be
used such information other than for purposes of this SECTION 1.3 and shall
not disclose or permit to be disclosed such information (other than to its
Agents for purposes of this SECTION 1.3) except as required by law or legal
process, and it shall be a condition to the granting of such access to any
work papers, that the Parent and its representatives execute any releases and
indemnity agreements customarily required by the Buyer\'s accountants for
such access. The Parent and its accountants may reasonably make inquiries of
the Buyer and the Company and their respective accountants or other Agents
regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Preliminary
Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and the Buyer shall
use its, and shall cause the Company to use its, commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any such accountants to cooperate with and respond to such
inquiries. If the Parent has any objections to the Preliminary Statement, the
Parent shall deliver to the Buyer a statement   3   setting forth in
reasonable detail its objections thereto (an "OBJECTIONS STATEMENT"). If an
Objections Statement is not delivered to the Buyer within forty-five (45)
days after delivery of the Preliminary Statement, the Preliminary Statement
shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Parent
and the Buyer shall negotiate to resolve any such objections, but if they do
not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the delivery of
the Objections Statement, the Parent and the Buyer shall submit such dispute
to a mutually agreeable third party that is not a public accounting firm (the
"DISPUTE RESOLUTION AUDITOR"). Any further communications with the Dispute
Resolution Auditor must be written and delivered to each party to the
dispute. The Dispute Resolution Auditor shall consider only those items and
amounts that are identified in the Objections Statement as being items
that the Parent and the Buyer are unable to resolve. The Dispute
Resolution Auditor\'s determination will be based solely on the definitions
of Cash, Net Working Capital, Net Working Capital Adjustment, Indebtedness,
Transaction Expenses and Closing Date Incentive Award Payments contained
herein and the provisions of this SECTION 1.3.1. The Parent and the Buyer
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute
Resolution Auditor to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable.
Further, the Dispute Resolution Auditor\'s determination shall be based
solely on the presentations by the Buyer and the Parent that are in
accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e.,
not on the basis of an independent review). The resolution of the dispute by
the Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable on
the parties hereto, and judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Arbiter in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. The costs and expenses of the Dispute
Resolution Auditor shall be allocated between the Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Lenders and the Parent, on the other hand, based upon the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to
the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the Parent
claims the Net Adjustment Amount is $1,000 greater than the amount determined
by the Buyer\'s accountants, and the Buyer contests only $500 of the amount
claimed by the Parent, and if the Dispute Resolution Auditor ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding to the Parent $300 of the $500 contested,
then the costs and expenses of arbitration will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 /
500) to the Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200 / 500) to the Lenders and the
Parent.   1.3.2. "NET ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT" means an amount equal to
zero MINUS (a) the amount by which the Estimated Cash exceeds the Cash as
finally determined pursuant to SECTION 1.3.1, PLUS (b) the amount by which
the Cash as finally determined pursuant to SECTION 1.3.1 exceeds the
Estimated Cash, PLUS (c) the amount by which the Estimated Indebtedness
exceeds the Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to SECTION 1.3.1,
MINUS (d) the amount by which the Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant
to SECTION 1.3.1 exceeds the Estimated Indebtedness, MINUS (e) the amount by
which the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment exceeds the Net Working
Capital Adjustment as finally determined pursuant to SECTION 1.3.1, PLUS (f)
the amount by which the Net Working Capital Adjustment as finally determined
pursuant to SECTION 1.3.1 exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment, PLUS (g) the amount by which the Estimated Transaction Expenses
exceeds the Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to SECTION
1.3.1, MINUS (h) the amount by which the Transaction Expenses as finally
determined pursuant to SECTION 1.3.1 exceeds the Estimated Transaction
Expenses, PLUS (i) the amount by which the Estimated Closing Date Incentive
Award Payments exceeds the Closing Date Incentive Award Payments as finally
determined pursuant to SECTION 1.3.1, MINUS (j) the amount   4   by which
the Closing Date Incentive Award Payments as finally determined pursuant to
SECTION 1.3.1 exceeds the Estimated Closing Date Incentive
Award Payments.   1.4. POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT.   1.4.1. If the
Net Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to SECTION 1.3 above is
a positive number, then the Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within
five (5) business days) deliver to the Parent the Net Adjustment Amount by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by the Parent, together with interest thereon from the Closing
Date to the date of actual payment at a variable rate equal to the prime rate
(as reported in the WALL STREET JOURNAL "MONEY RATES") from and including the
Closing Date to, but not including, the date of payment (the "NET ADJUSTMENT
INTEREST AMOUNT"). If the Net Adjustment Amount as finally determined
pursuant to SECTION 1.3 above is a negative number, then the Buyer, at its
option, shall be entitled to cash contained in the Escrow Account to
the extent of the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount (or any
portion thereof), together with the Net Adjustment Interest Amount. In the
event the Buyer elects to have only a portion or none of the absolute value
of the Net Adjustment Amount, together with the Net Adjustment Interest
Amount, satisfied by the Escrow Account or if the absolute value of the Net
Adjustment Amount, together with the Net Adjustment Interest Amount, exceeds
the amount in the Escrow Fund, then the Parent shall, and the Lenders shall
cause the Parent to, promptly (but in any event within five (5) business
days) pay to the Buyer, to the extent of any amounts that the Buyer does not
elect to have paid from the Escrow Account, the absolute value of the Net
Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or
more accounts designated by the Buyer, together with the Net Adjustment
Interest Amount, to the extent of any amounts that the Buyer does not elect
to have paid from the Escrow Account.   1.4.2. The Closing Payment as
adjusted, if at all, by this SECTION 1.4 shall be referred to herein as the
"FINAL PURCHASE PRICE. "   1.5. EXCLUDED ASSETS AND EXCLUDED
LIABILITIES.   (a) The assets and liabilities specifically related to the
Company\'s operations at its Carson, California, Sacramento,
California, Union City, California and Portland, Oregon facilities (the
"EXCLUDED FACILITIES") are set forth on SCHEDULE 1.5 of the Disclosure
Schedules (the "EXCLUDED ASSETS" and the "EXCLUDED LIABILITIES"). Prior to
the Closing, the Company will, and the Parent will cause the Company to,
either (i) complete the full or partial sale of the Excluded Facilities and
Excluded Assets to (and cause the Excluded Liabilities to be assumed by (to
the extent such sale contemplates such assumption)) an unaffiliated third
party, or (ii) to the extent not sold pursuant to clause (i), close the
Excluded Facilities and terminate the employment of all employees employed at
the Excluded Facilities (the "EXCLUDED ASSETS TRANSACTION"). Any sale of such
facilities shall be effected pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (or
other documents) in a form reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. Prior to the
Closing, the Company will (i) notify the collective bargaining
representatives of any employees of the Excluded Facilities of the sale or
closure of such facilities; (ii) fulfill any obligations to bargain with any
unions over the sale or closure of such facilities (including by bargaining
in good faith with such unions); and (iii) negotiate any severance or other
obligations and any resolution of grievances or unfair labor practice
charges.   5    (b) The following provisions of this SECTION
1.5(B) shall apply if and to the extent the Company does not complete the
sale of all of the Excluded Facilities and Excluded Assets (as contemplated
by Section 1.5(a)(i)) and novation of the Excluded Liabilities prior to the
Closing.   (i) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. With respect to any accounts receivable
included in the Excluded Assets, for a period not to exceed 120 days after
the Closing, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
collect such receivables in the manner regularly pursued by the Company with
respect to the collection of its other accounts receivable in the ordinary
course of business. Any amounts so collected (net of out-of-pocket costs of
collection and net of any amounts otherwise owed to the Company or the Buyer
pursuant to this SECTION 1.5) will be remitted to the Parent
reasonably promptly following receipt. The Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to share any notice of a dispute as to the validity or
enforceability of any accounts receivable received from the debtor of such
accounts receivable with a single member of the Company\'s management
designated by the Parent or the Parent to the extent any such notices involve
disputes for amounts in the aggregate in excess of $1,000 per customer. The
Company shall not agree to any settlement, discount or reduction of the
accounts receivable without the prior written consent of the Parent (not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to the extent any such written notices
involve disputes for amounts in the aggregate in excess of $1,000 per
customer. The Company\'s collection obligation shall not include any
obligation to bring suit, engage a collection agent or take any other legal
action, or otherwise incur any costs to third parties, for the collection or
sale (as the case may be) of the accounts receivable. On the 120th day after
the Closing (or earlier, if requested by the Parent), the Company shall
assign the accounts receivable to the Parent. Following such assignment, the
Company shall have no further responsibilities under this SECTION
1.5(b)(I).   (ii) LEASES. With respect to any Leases included in the
Excluded Assets ("EXCLUDED LEASES"), the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to terminate such Excluded Leases without
further liability to the Company and settle any claims with the landlords or
counterparties thereunder (the "LANDLORDS") in respect of such termination;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if, notwithstanding such efforts, such Excluded
Leases have not been terminated and settlements with Landlords completed as
of the Closing, if requested by the Parent, the Company will following the
Closing use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate termination
liabilities with the Landlords and (ii) negotiate subleases with prospective
sub tenants (it being understood that the Company will not be required to
provide more than one member of management in respect of either of these
activities) and (iii) will provide necessary personnel to leave the premises
demised under the Excluded Leases in broom clean condition for return to the
Landlord; PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the Company will have no further
obligation to undertake such activities after the date that is 120 days after
the Closing Date. The Company will not enter into any sublease relating to
the Excluded Leases (whether before or after Closing) or make any settlement
with any Landlord (whether before or after Closing) without the prior written
consent of the Buyer; PROVIDED that the Buyer will not unreasonably withhold
its consent to the extent any such sublease effects a novation and complete
release of the Company\'s liability under the related Excluded Lease. In
addition, for a period of 120 days following the Closing, the Company will
not enter into any sublease relating to the Excluded Leases (whether before
or after Closing) or make any settlement with any Landlord (whether before or
after Closing) without the prior written consent of the Parent. With respect
to any claims of Landlords   6   under Excluded Leases, for a period of
120 days following the Closing, the Parent will have the right to approve any
settlement of such claims by the Company. After the 120th day following the
Closing, the Company may terminate the Excluded Leases and settle claims with
Landlords on such terms as the Company determines in its sole discretion,
except, as to any Excluded Lease, to the extent that such settlement exceeds
105% of the remaining lease payments plus the outstanding amount of any
associated operating expenses for such Excluded Lease, in which case the
consent of the Parent will be required (not to be unreasonably withheld) for
settlement of such claim. Any amounts paid in settlement in respect of such
claims will be paid by the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that to the extent
such settlement amounts exceed the Lease Escrow Amount, such excess shall be
an Excluded Assets Transaction Liability pursuant to SECTION 1.5(c). To the
extent a sublease is entered into with respect to any Excluded Facility, the
Company will remit to the Parent any amounts received from the subtenant as
rent payments or operating expense reimbursement promptly following the
Company\'s receipt thereof.   (iii) OTHER LIABILITIES. Any accounts payable
or accrued expenses included in the Excluded Liabilities will be paid by
the Company prior to the Closing.   (iv) OTHER ASSETS; SERVICES. Any
trademarks or tradenames or other intellectual property associated with the
Excluded Facilities or the Excluded Assets will be retained by the Company
after the Closing. With respect to fixed assets included in the Excluded
Assets, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts prior to Closing
to sell or liquidate such assets; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if as of the
Closing the Company has been unable to sell or liquidate such assets
notwithstanding such efforts, if requested by the Parent, the Company will
use its reasonable efforts to sell or liquidate such fixed assets for a
period not to exceed 60 days after the Closing (it being understood that the
Company will not be required to provide more than one member of management in
respect of these activities). The Buyer may purchase any racking included in
the fixed assets (to the extent the Company does not otherwise sell or
transfer such racking to Landlords in connection with the termination of the
Excluded Leases) for no consideration, except the Buyer will pay for any
costs of removing and/or shipping such racking. With respect to any inventory
included in the Excluded Assets (not otherwise sold to an unaffiliated third
party under SECTION 1.5(a)(i)), the Buyer will purchase any such inventory at
the Closing subject to the terms and conditions of the Inventory Purchase
Agreement substantially in the form of EXHIBIT A hereto (the "INVENTORY
PURCHASE AGREEMENT"). On or prior to the fifth (5th) business day preceding
the Closing, the Company will conduct a physical count of the inventory at
the Excluded Facilities and will permit the Buyer and its representatives to
observe and participate in such physical count. The inventory to be purchased
pursuant to the Inventory Purchase Agreement will be adjusted to reflect the
results of such physical count.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing and
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any obligations or liabilities,
and any costs or expenses, associated with the Excluded Assets Transaction
will be considered "EXCLUDED ASSETS TRANSACTION LIABILITIES" for which all
Buyer Indemnified Parties (as defined in SECTION 11.2), including, after the
Closing, the Company, shall be indemnified by the Lenders and the Parent. For
the avoidance of doubt, the term "EXCLUDED ASSETS TRANSACTION LIABILITIES"
will include any claims made by an account debtor in respect of the accounts
receivable referred to in SECTION 1.5(b)(i), the amount of any severance
payable to employees terminated as a result of the Excluded Assets
Transaction, any Losses (as   7   defined in SECTION 13.19) associated
with labor grievances, unfair labor practices or other claims arising out of
the Excluded Assets Transaction, liabilities arising under the Leases
relating to the Excluded Facilities, any Losses, including withdrawal
liabilities, arising from any "multiemployer plans," as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA, contributed to or required to be contributed to by the
Company and any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or
the Buyer in taking any actions after the Closing to complete the closure of
the Excluded Facilities or the sale, or liquidation or satisfaction, of the
Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any
liabilities to Landlords under the Excluded Leases in respect of the closing
of the Excluded Facilities and termination of the Excluded Leases will be
Excluded Assets Transaction Liabilities only to the extent that the amount of
such liabilities exceeds the Lease Escrow Amount.   ARTICLE II  CLOSING

the LLC Interests are owned beneficially and of record by the Parent, free
and clear of any Encumbrances.   3.5. SUBSIDIARIES. Except as set forth in

UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.   (a) Attached hereto as SCHEDULE 3.6(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules are the consolidated audited balance sheets of the
Parent for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the related
consolidated audited statements of income and retained earnings and cash
flows for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (collectively, the
"AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"), and the consolidated unaudited balance sheet
of the Parent as of March 31, 2006 (the "LATEST BALANCE SHEET") and the
related statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows for the
three-month period ended March 31, 2006 (together with the Audited Financial
Statements, the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). The Financial Statements (i) were
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, for the absence of footnote disclosures and other presentation
items and changes resulting from normal year-end adjustments, which are not
material), and (ii) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Parent on a
consolidated basis as of such dates and for the periods then ended. Except as
disclosed on SCHEDULE 3.6(a) of the Disclosure Schedules, the value of the
inventory reflected on the 2005 Balance Sheet would not materially differ
from that value reflected on the 2005 Balance Sheet were the cost of such
inventory calculated using the average cost method.   (b) Attached hereto as
SCHEDULE 3.6(b) of the Disclosure Schedules are (i) the unaudited balance
sheets, and related statements of income, of the Company (excluding the
Excluded Assets) as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the unaudited balance sheet, and related statement of income, of the
Company (excluding the Excluded Assets) as of, and for the three-month period
ended, March 31, 2006 (collectively, the "COMPANY UNAUDITED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS"), and (ii) the unaudited balance sheets, and related statements
of income, of the Excluded Facilities, the Excluded Assets and the Excluded
Liabilities as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
the unaudited balance sheet, and related statement of income, of the Excluded
Facilities, the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities as of, and for
the three-month period ended, March 31, 2006 (the "EXCLUDED ASSETS  
12   UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" and together with the Company
Unaudited Financial Statements, the "COMPANY AND EXCLUDED ASSETS FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS"). The Company and Excluded Assets Financial Statements were
prepared in good faith in accordance with GAAP (except for the absence of
footnote disclosures and other presentation items and changes resulting from
normal year-end adjustments, which are not material) and were prepared in a
manner that is consistent with the Schedule of Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities set forth in SCHEDULE 1.5 of the Disclosure Schedules.   (c)
Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.6(c) of the Disclosure Schedules, the
Company has no material liability or obligation of any nature, whether due or
to become due, absolute, contingent or otherwise, except (i) to the extent
reflected on the Financial Statements, (ii) liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business after December 31, 2005 that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) any other liabilities
that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
There are no obligations or liabilities of the Company relating to the
Excluded Facilities other than the Excluded Liabilities.   (d) The Parent is
a "holding company" that neither owns, licenses, leases or otherwise has
rights to any assets or properties or other rights, except its ownership of
the LLC Interests.   3.7. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as
set forth on SCHEDULE 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedules, since December 31,
2005, the Company has conducted its business only in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice and there has not been any events, changes,
conditions, developments or occurrences that, individually or in the
aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing, except as set forth on
SCHEDULE 3.7 of the Disclosure Schedules or as reflected in the Financial
Statements, since December 31, 2005, the Company has not taken any action
that, if taken after the date hereof, would constitute a breach of clauses
(a)-(u) of SECTION 6.3.   3.8. TITLE; CONDITION OF ASSETS.   (a) The
Company has good and marketable title to all of the assets and properties
that it purports to own (including those reflected on the Financial
Statements, but excluding the Excluded Assets and any such assets and

each case, as to which such resignation has been requested by the Buyer.  
6.8. NOTIFICATION. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, each Lender,
the Parent and the Company, respectively, shall promptly notify the Buyer of
any event or fact coming to the Lenders\', the Parent\'s or the Company\'s
attention prior to Closing that causes any of the Lenders\', the Parent\'s or
the Company\'s respective representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained under this Agreement to be inaccurate in a manner
that would cause the conditions set forth in SECTION 7.1 or SECTION 7.2 not
to be satisfied.   6.9. INSURANCE. Prior to the Closing, the Company and
the Parent shall maintain in full force and effect the policies of insurance
listed on SCHEDULE 3.21.1 of the Disclosure Schedules, subject only to
variations required by the ordinary operations of its business, or else will

The Company shall promptly advise the Buyer in writing of any change of
insurer or type of coverage in respect of the policies listed on SCHEDULE

from the date of this Agreement through the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, none of the Lenders, the Company nor the
Parent, nor any of their respective officers, directors, limited liability
company managers, employees, affiliates, agents or representatives will,
directly or indirectly, encourage, initiate or solicit offers for, furnish
information regarding or engage in any negotiations, discussions, meetings or
other communications with any third party concerning, or enter into any
agreements with respect to, any acquisition of the Company or the Parent or
any business of the Company or the Parent by any party other than the Buyer,
whether by sale of stock, merger, sale of assets, business combination,
reorganization or otherwise, and in the event that during such period any
offer is received, the Lenders, the Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, will promptly communicate to the Buyer the existence, terms and identity
of the party making such offer.   6.11. CONFIDENTIALITY. During the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Lenders and the Parent shall, and shall cause their

entity or use for his own benefit or the benefit of any other person or
entity any technology, know-how, trade secrets (including all results of
research and development), product formulas, industrial designs, inventions
or other confidential proprietary information regarding the Company and its
business and operation ("CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION") in its possession or
control. The obligations of the Lenders and the Parent under this SECTION
6.11 shall not apply to Confidential Information that (a) is or becomes
generally available to the public without breach of the commitment provided
for in this SECTION 6.11; (b) is independently developed by the Lenders, the
Parent or their affiliates without reference to any Confidential Information;
(c) is or becomes available to the Lenders, the Parent or their affiliates on

required to be disclosed by law, order or regulation of a court or tribunal

Lenders and the Parent shall notify the Buyer as early as reasonably
practicable prior to disclosure to allow the Buyer or the Company to  
33   take appropriate measures to preserve the confidentiality of such
Confidential Information. Notwithstanding this SECTION 6.11, the Lenders and
their affiliates (excluding Portfolio Companies) shall be permitted to
disclose at any time summaries of confidential information (which will not
include any trade secret or other proprietary information (excluding summary
financial information)) of the Company in connection with communications with
their limited partners, financing sources, employees, agents, advisors,
partners and potential partners or to the extent reasonably required in the
ordinary course of their business.   6.12. NON-COMPETE.   (a) During the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of
the Closing Date (the "NON-COMPETE PERIOD"), each of the Lenders and the
Parent each covenant and agree not to, and shall cause their affiliates
(including any Portfolio Companies) not to, directly or indirectly, anywhere
in the world, conduct, manage, operate, engage in, control or participate in
the management, operation or control of, have an ownership interest in
(except as a holder of stock in a corporation whose stock is publicly traded
and which is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and which is not an affiliate of such party, and then only to the
extent of owning not more than five (5%) percent of the issued and
outstanding stock of such corporation) any business or enterprise engaged in
the business of selling or distributing janitorial or sanitation products,
including cleaning chemicals, cleaning equipment, consumables or janitorial
paper products, or the repair of janitorial or sanitation equipment (the
"BUSINESS").   (b) During the Non-Compete Period, the Lenders and
the Parent each shall not, and shall cause their affiliates (including
any Portfolio Companies) not to, directly or indirectly, call-on, solicit
or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any customer, vendor or other
business relation of the Company in any manner for the cessation of any
business with the Company or the provision of products or services to the
Company with respect to the Business.   (c) During the Non-Compete Period,
each of the Lenders and the Parent shall not, and shall cause their
affiliates (including any Portfolio Companies) not to, directly or
indirectly, call-on, solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any
employee of the Company (or any employee of the Company who after the Closing
becomes an employee of the Buyer) to leave the employ of the Company or the
Buyer for any reason whatsoever, nor shall any Lender or the Parent or any of
their affiliates (including any Portfolio Company) offer or provide
employment (whether such employment is for any Lender or the Parent any other
business or enterprise), either on a full-time basis or part-time or
consulting basis, to any such employees; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) with
respect to any employee on SCHEDULE 6.12(c)(i) hereof, a Portfolio Company
that is not otherwise in violation of this SECTION 6.12 may offer employment
to such employee at any time following a termination of such employee\'s
employment by the Company or the Buyer subsequent to the Closing Date; (ii)
with respect to any employee on SCHEDULE 6.12(c)(ii) hereof, a Portfolio
Company that is not otherwise in violation of this SECTION 6.12 may offer
employment to any such employee whose employment has terminated subsequent to
the Closing Date, but in no event prior to the expiration of the 12-month
period after such employee\'s termination; (iii) with respect to any employee
on SCHEDULE 6.12(c)(iii) hereof, a Portfolio Company that is not otherwise in
violation of this SECTION 6.12 may offer employment to such  
34   employee at any time following termination of such employee\'s
employment, but, for the avoidance of doubt, only so long as none of the
Lenders or their affiliates solicited the employee to terminate such
employee\'s employment with the Company or the Buyer, or solicited the
Portfolio Company to solicit the employee to terminate such employee\'s
employment with the Company or the Buyer or to offer to employ such employee;
(iv) with respect to the employee on SCHEDULE 6.12(c)(iv) hereof, a Portfolio
Company that is not otherwise in violation of this SECTION 6.12 may offer
employment to such employee at any time following the one year anniversary of
the Closing Date; and (v) with respect to the employee on SCHEDULE 6.12(c)(v)
hereof, a Portfolio Company that is not otherwise in violation of this
SECTION 6.12 may offer employment to such employee at any time after the
expiration of the 18-month period following the Closing Date, PROVIDED that
the Buyer will not unreasonably withhold its consent if any Lender requests
the reduction of such 18-month period to a 12-month period following the
Closing Date.   (d) Each of the Lenders and the Parent acknowledge
and agree that the provisions of this SECTION 6.12 are reasonable and
necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the Buyer and its
investment in the Company. Neither any Lender nor the Parent shall contest
that the Buyer\'s or the Company\'s remedies at law for any breach or threat
of breach by a Lender or the Parent or any of their affiliates of the
provisions of this SECTION 6.12 will be inadequate, and that the Buyer and
the Company shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this SECTION 6.12 and to enforce specifically
such terms and provisions, in addition to any other remedy to which the Buyer
or the Company may be entitled at law or equity. The restrictive covenants
contained in this SECTION 6.12 are covenants independent of any other
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement between the parties
hereunder and the existence of any claim that the Lenders or the Parent may
allege against the Buyer under any other provision of the Agreement or any
other agreement will not prevent the enforcement of these covenants.   (e)
If any of the provisions contained in this SECTION 6.12 shall for any reason
be held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject,
then such provision shall be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to
be valid and enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law or
the determination by a court of competent jurisdiction.   (f)
Notwithstanding the provisions of SECTION 6.12(a) above, a Portfolio Company
may engage in the Business to the extent (i) such Portfolio Company\'s
primary business is in a Designated Industry or (ii) such Portfolio
Company\'s engaging in the Business is incidental to such
Portfolio Company\'s primary business which is not the Business. For this
purpose, a "DESIGNATED INDUSTRY" means any retail or manufacturing business;
and a Portfolio Company\'s engaging in the Business will be incidental to its
primary business if the aggregate amount of annual revenues the Portfolio
Company derives from the Business are (A) less than 15% of the Portfolio
Company\'s aggregate revenues and (B) less than $20,000,000; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any company that is in the distribution business that has any
business unit, subsidiary or division specifically focused on the
"janitation/sanitation" business segment will be deemed to be engaging in the
Business IPSO FACTO and regardless of the size of such business unit,
subsidiary or division. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing and
anything to the contrary herein, in no event will any of the Lenders or their
affiliates (including any Portfolio Companies), directly or indirectly,
anywhere in the world, conduct, manage, operate, engage in, control or
participate in the management, operation or control of, have an ownership
interest in (except as a holder of stock in a corporation whose stock is
publicly traded and which is subject to the reporting requirements of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which is not an affiliate of such party,
and then only to the extent of owning not more than five (5%) percent of the
issued and outstanding stock of such corporation) any of the entities set
forth in SCHEDULE 6.12(f).   6.13. ACCESS TO BOOKS AND RECORDS. From and
after the Closing, the Buyer shall provide the Parent and its authorized
Agents with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and copying),
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the books and
records of the Company with respect to periods or occurrences prior to or on
the Closing Date in connection with the preparation of tax returns or
responding to tax authorities or the defense of a Third Party Claim; PROVIDED
that the Buyer may condition such access on execution of a confidentiality
agreement in customary form; PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that such
confidentiality agreement shall not unreasonably limit in any way the
Parent\'s ability to disclose any information in the preparation of tax
returns or in responding to tax authorities. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by the Parent, the Buyer shall not, for a period of seven (7)
years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any
of the material books and records of the Company for any period prior to the
Closing Date without first giving reasonable prior notice to the Parent and
offering to surrender to the Parent such books and records or any portion
thereof which the Buyer may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.   6.14.
FURTHER ASSURANCES. At any time or from time to time after the Closing, each
party hereto shall, at the request of another party, execute and deliver any
further instruments or documents and take all such further action as the
other party may reasonably request in order to evidence the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At any time or from time to
time after the Closing, each party hereto shall, at the request of another
party, execute and deliver any further instruments or documents and take all
such further action as the other party may reasonably request in order to

this Agreement.   6.15. EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS. Following the
Closing, the Buyer will cause any employee benefit plans of Buyer in which
the Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes
of eligibility and vesting, but not for purposes of benefit accrual or any
early retirement subsidiary or to the extent it would result in duplication
of benefits, service with the Company, to the same extent such service was
credited under a comparable plan of the Company. To the extent that the Buyer
modifies any coverage or Benefit Plans under which the Employees currently
participate, the Buyer shall waive any applicable waiting periods, pre-
existing conditions or actively-at-work requirements and shall give such
Employees credit under the new coverages or benefit plans for deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket payments that have been paid during the year in
which such coverage or plan modification occurs. This SECTION 6.15 shall
survive the Closing Date, is intended to benefit the Company and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of the Buyer. Nothing contained in this
SECTION 6.15 shall obligate the Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates
to (a) maintain any Benefit Plan or (b) retain the employment of any
particular Employee.   36    6.16. CONDITIONS.   (a) Subject to the
proviso set forth in SECTION 2.1, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable

and ARTICLE VIII are satisfied. For the avoidance of doubt, prior to July 3,
2006, the Buyer has no affirmative obligation to pursue the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter.   (c) The Company
and the Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII to be satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible after the

detail reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with respect to the status,
proposed closing date and material terms of the proposed financing. The Buyer
shall not consent to (x) any amendment or modification to the Commitment
Letter or Fee Letter if such amendment or modification would reasonably be
expected to change the conditions precedent set forth therein, the timing of
the funding of the commitments thereunder, or the cash amount of the funding
commitments thereunder, in each case in a manner that is adverse in any
material respect to the Parent (collectively, the "RESTRICTED COMMITMENT
LETTER AMENDMENTS") or (y) early termination of the Commitment Letter or Fee
Letter. The Buyer shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the Commitment Letter and
Fee Letter until the Closing or earlier termination of this Agreement.

shall continue to be bound by the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 14, 2005, by and between the
Parent and the Buyer. Upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate.   6.20. DELIVERY OF AMENDMENT(S) TO DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES. The
Company and the Parent shall have the right to deliver to the Buyer updated

SCHEDULE 6.24 hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Parent nor
the Company will agree to or make any modification in any Lease (or other

Company upon written notice to the other parties hereto, upon the (i)
withdrawal or termination of the Commitment Letter or (ii) the making of a
Restricted Commitment Letter Amendment; or   (h) by the Buyer, upon written
notice to the other parties hereto, if updated Disclosure Schedules are
delivered under SECTION 6.20 that disclose any event or circumstance that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and, if
curable, the event or circumstance that gave rise to, or is giving rise to,
such Material Adverse Effect has not been cured by the Company, the Parent or
the Lenders within ten (10) business days after receipt by the Buyer of such
updated Disclosure Schedules.   9.2. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event
this Agreement is terminated by either the Buyer on the one hand, or the
Company, the Parent or the Lenders on the other hand as provided above, the
provisions of this Agreement shall immediately become void and of no further
force and effect (other than this SECTION 9.2, SECTION 11.6 and ARTICLE XII
and ARTICLE XIII hereof which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of the Buyer on the
one hand or the Parent, the Company or the Lenders on the other hand, to one
another, except for knowing or willful breaches of this Agreement prior to
the time of such termination.   ARTICLE X  TAX MATTERS   10.1. TAX
TREATMENT OF TRANSACTION.   (a) The Parent and the Buyer agree to treat the
purchase and sale of the LLC Interests as a purchase and sale of the assets
held by the Company for federal income tax purposes and, where permitted by
law, for all analogous state and local income tax purposes.   (b) The
Parent and the Buyer agree that the consideration deemed paid for the assets
of the Company shall be allocated among the assets of the Company in
accordance with the principles set forth on SCHEDULE 10.1 of the Disclosure
Schedules (the "ALLOCATION PRINCIPLES"). Within 30 days following the final
determination of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to SECTION 1.3.2 of this
Agreement, the Buyer shall deliver to the Parent a draft allocation of the
consideration deemed paid for the assets of the Company, for federal income
tax purposes prepared in accordance with the Allocation Principles and
Section 1060 of the Code. Within 21 days following receipt of such draft
allocation, the Parent shall deliver to the Buyer notice of any disputed
items. The Buyer and the Parent shall attempt to promptly resolve any such
disputed items, provided that if they are unable to resolve any such disputes
within 21 days of the Parent\'s delivery of notice of any disputed items, any
remaining disputed items shall be submitted to the Dispute Resolution Auditor
for final resolution, with the costs of the Dispute Resolution Auditor borne
equally by the Buyer and the Parent. Neither the Buyer nor the Parent shall
take any position (whether in audit, tax returns, or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the final determination of the allocation unless required
to do so by applicable law. Within 30 days following the final  
43   determination of the allocation of the consideration among the assets
for federal income Tax purposes, the Parent shall prepare a draft allocation
of the consideration for state and local Tax purposes, which shall be
consistent with the final determination of the allocation for federal income
Tax purposes, and the Parent shall deliver to the Buyer such draft
allocation. Within 21 days following receipt of such draft allocation, the
Buyer shall deliver to the Parent notice of any disputed items, PROVIDED that
if they are unable to resolve any such disputes within 21 days of the
Buyer\'s delivery of notice of any disputed items, any remaining disputed
items shall be submitted to the Dispute Resolution Auditor for final
resolution, with the costs of the Dispute Resolution Auditor borne equally by
the Buyer and the Parent. Neither the Buyer nor the Parent shall take any
position (whether in audit, Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent
with the final determination of such allocation unless required to do so by
applicable law.   (c) No later than 90 days following the later of the
end of the taxable year of the Parent that includes the Closing Date or the
final determinations of the allocations of the consideration deemed paid for
the assets of the Company pursuant to SECTION 10.1(b) hereof, the Parent
shall deliver to the Buyer a draft calculation, prepared in reasonable
detail, of (i) the federal alternative minimum tax liability payable by the
Parent and attributable to the limitation under Section 56(d)(1)(A)(i)(II) of
the Code on the ability of the Parent to fully deduct the net operating loss
deduction allowable to the Parent under Section 172 of the Code as adjusted
pursuant to Section 56(d)(2) of the Code in the taxable year including the
Closing Date, (ii) any liabilities for Taxes payable by the Parent (including
as a result of the Parent\'s indemnification obligation pursuant to SECTION
10.2) arising under similar provisions and similar limitations of state or
local Tax law in the taxable year including the Closing Date, and (iii) any
state and local Tax liability payable by the Parent (including as a result of
the Parent\'s indemnification obligation pursuant to SECTION 10.2) that is
not otherwise described in clause (ii) of this sentence and that is
attributable to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (the
"INCREMENTAL TAX COST"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the amount of any state and
local Tax liability calculated pursuant to clause (iii) of this sentence and
included in the Incremental Tax Cost shall be limited to $200,000. Within 21
days following receipt of such calculation, the Buyer shall deliver to the
Parent notice of any disagreement with respect to such calculation. The Buyer
and the Parent shall attempt to promptly resolve any disputes with respect to
such calculations, provided that if they are unable to so resolve such
disputes within 21 days following the Buyer\'s delivery of notice of any
disputed items, any unresolved disputed items shall then be submitted to the
Dispute Resolution Auditor for final resolution, with the costs of such
Dispute Resolution Auditor borne equally by the Buyer and the Parent. Within
10 days of the final determination of the Incremental Tax Cost, the Buyer
shall pay to the Parent the amount of the Incremental Tax Cost as so finally
determined.   10.2. TAX INDEMNIFICATION. To the extent that such Taxes
exceed the accrual for such Taxes in the Closing Balance Sheet, the Lenders
and the Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and the Company
from and against: (a) all Taxes of the Company and the Parent for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end
of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date, (b) each Lender\'s or the Parent\'s share of any
transfer Taxes payable under SECTION 10.4, (c) any and all income Taxes of
any member of a consolidated group of which the Company or a predecessor was
a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Section
1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations or any analogous or similar state,
local, or foreign law or regulation, and (d) any and all Taxes of any person
(other than the Company) imposed on the Company as a transferee or successor,
by contract or pursuant to   44   any law, rule or regulation, which
Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing. In the
event a taxable period includes a period prior to the Closing Date, Taxes
shall, in the case of real and personal property Taxes, be apportioned
ratably to such taxable period on a daily basis and, in the case of other
Taxes, be apportioned to such taxable period based on a closing of the books
on the Closing Date.   10.3. ASSISTANCE AND RECORDS. The parties shall
provide each other with such assistance as each may reasonably request in
connection with (a) the preparation of Tax Returns required to be filed with
respect to the Company and the Parent, (b) any audit or other examination by
any Taxing Authority, (c) any judicial or administrative proceedings relating
to liability for Taxes, or (d) any claim for refund in respect of such Taxes.
Such assistance shall include making employees available to other parties and
their counsel, providing additional information and explanation of any
material to be provided, and retaining, furnishing to, or permitting the
copying by, any party or its counsel of any records, returns, schedules,
documents, work papers or other relevant materials that might reasonably be
expected to be used in connection with any such return, audit, examination,
proceeding or claim. The Lenders and the Parent will retain the right to
conduct and resolve any audit, administrative or judicial proceeding relating
to Taxes with respect to any period ending prior to or on the Closing Date,
to the extent the Lenders or the Parent may be obligated to indemnify the
Buyer and the Company pursuant to SECTION 10.2; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
settlement resulting from the resolution of such proceeding shall be accepted
that may have an adverse effect on the Company or the Buyer without the prior
written consent of the Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;
PROVIDED FURTHER that the Buyer and the Company may participate in any such
audit or proceeding if the resolution of such audit or proceeding is
reasonably expected to have an impact on the Tax liability of the Buyer or
the Company in any period after the Closing Date. The Lenders and the Parent
will have the right to participate in the resolution of any audit,
administrative or judicial proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to any
periods starting on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing
Date, to the extent the Lenders or the Parent may be obligated to indemnify
the Buyer and the Company pursuant to SECTION 10.2. The Buyer will promptly
notify the Lenders and the Parent of any such audit, proposed adjustment or
related matter that could affect any Lender\'s or the Parent\'s obligations
pursuant to SECTION 10.2. The Buyer will retain and, upon the reasonable
request of the Lenders or the Parent, provide any records or information that
may be relevant to any such return, audit, examination, proceeding or
claim.   10.4. TRANSFER TAXES. The Buyer, the Lenders and the Parent
agree to share any transfer or similar Taxes imposed as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such that 50% of such Taxes
shall be borne by the Buyer and 50% shall be borne by the Lenders and/or the
Parent.   ARTICLE XI  SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION   11.1. SURVIVAL. The
representations and warranties of the Company, the Parent, the Lenders and
the Buyer under this Agreement or in any certificate or Schedule furnished
pursuant hereto and the Company and Parent Pre-Closing Covenants and the
Lenders Pre-Closing Covenants (all as defined below), shall survive the
closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement until the
expiration of the 18-month period following the Closing   45   Date (the
"SURVIVAL PERIOD"), and no action or claim for Losses (as
hereinafter defined) resulting from any such misrepresentation or breach of
warranty, or breach of any Company and Parent Pre-Closing Covenant or Lenders
Pre-Closing Covenant, as the case may be, shall be brought or made after the
Survival Period, except that such time limitation shall not apply to:   (a)
claims for misrepresentations or breach of warranties relating to SECTION
3.1, SECTION 4.1 and SECTION 5.1 hereof (Organization), SECTION 3.2, SECTION
4.3 and SECTION 5.2 hereof (Authority), SECTION 3.4 hereof (Capitalization)
and SECTION 4.2 (Ownership of Stock of the Parent and Indebtedness), or any
breach of SECTION 6.3(a)-(d) or SECTION 6.3(o), all of which may be asserted
at any time;   (b) claims for misrepresentations or breach of warranties
relating to SECTION 3.15 hereof (Environmental Matters), which may be
asserted at any time prior to the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, and
any claims for misrepresentations or breach of warranties relating to SECTION
3.16 (Employee Benefit Matters) or Section 3.17 hereof (Taxes), which may be
asserted at any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations
applicable to such matters; and   (c) any claims that have been asserted in
good faith and that are the subject of a written notice from the Lenders or
the Parent to the Buyer or from the Buyer to the Lenders or the Parent, as
may be applicable, prior to the expiration of the Survival Period or, in the
case of paragraph (b) above, prior to the applicable date set forth in such
paragraph.   It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that the foregoing
time limitations do not apply to any covenants in this Agreement other than
Lenders Pre-Closing Covenants and Company and Parent Pre-Closing
Covenants.   11.2. GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) Following the Closing,
each of the Lenders and the Parent, on a joint and several basis, shall
indemnify and defend the Buyer and the Company, and each of their respective
directors, limited liability company managers, officers, affiliates,
employees, agents and representatives ("BUYER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") and shall
hold each of them harmless from and against all Losses that are incurred or
suffered by any of them in connection with or resulting from:   (i) any
misrepresentation or breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or
warranty made by any Lender, the Parent or the Company in this Agreement or
any Disclosure Schedule (not taking into account any Updated Schedule) or in
the Seller Closing Certificate;   (ii) any breach of any covenants made by
the Company or the Parent in SECTION 6.1, SECTION 6.2, SECTION 6.3, SECTION
6.4, SECTION 6.5, SECTION 6.6(b), SECTION 6.7, SECTION 6.8, SECTION 6.9,
SECTION 6.10, SECTION 6.16, SECTION 6.20, or SECTION 6.21 in this Agreement
(the "COMPANY AND PARENT PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS");   46    (iii) any
breach of any covenants made by any Lender in SECTION 6.2, SECTION 6.6(a),
SECTION 6.8, Section 6.10, or SECTION 6.20 in this Agreement (the "LENDERS
PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS");   (iv) any breach of any covenants made by
the Company, any Lender or the Parent in this Agreement or any Disclosure
Schedule or any Ancillary Agreement other than the Company and Parent Pre-
Closing Covenants and the Lenders Pre-Closing Covenants; and   (v) any of
the matters referred to in SCHEDULE 11.2.2 of the Disclosure Schedules.  
(b) Following the Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify the Lenders, the Parent
and their directors, officers, affiliates (other than the Company or the Not-
For-Profit Subsidiary), employees, agents and representatives ("LENDER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") and shall hold each of them harmless from and against
all Losses that are incurred or suffered by any of them in connection with or
resulting from:   (i) any misrepresentation or breach of, or inaccuracy in,
any representation or warranty made by the Buyer in this Agreement or in the
Buyer Closing Certificate; and   (ii) any breach of any covenant made by
the Buyer in this Agreement (the "BUYER COVENANTS").   (c) Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) the Lenders and the Parent shall not be obligated to
provide any such indemnification for Losses pursuant to claims under SECTION
11.2(a)(i), SECTION 11.2(a)(ii) and SECTION 11.2(a)(iii) hereof (together,
"DOLLAR LIMITED CLAIMS") and (ii) the Buyer shall not be obligated to provide
any such indemnification for Losses pursuant to claims under SECTION
11.2(b)(i) hereof, unless the aggregate amount that the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or the Lender Indemnified Parties, as applicable, are entitled to
recover in respect of all such claims exceeds $1,000,000 (the "DEDUCTIBLE"),
in which case the Indemnitor (as defined in SECTION 11.2(M)(I) hereof) will
be liable for all Losses in excess of the Deductible; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Deductible shall not apply to claims for indemnification for Losses
pursuant to SECTION 3.1 (Organization), SECTION 3.2 (Authority), SECTION 3.4
(Capitalization), SECTION 3.22 (Brokers), SECTION 4.1 (Organization), SECTION
4.2 (Ownership of Stock of the Parent and Indebtedness), SECTION 4.3
(Authority; Effect of Agreement), SECTION 6.3(a)-(d) or SECTION 6.3(o).  
(d) In addition, except as otherwise provided below, the liability of the
Lenders and the Parent under SECTION 11.2(a)(i), SECTION 11.2(a)(ii) and
SECTION 11.2(a)(iii) hereof in respect of Dollar Limited Claims shall not
exceed in the aggregate $11,500,000 (the "CAP"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Cap shall not apply to any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any of
the representations and warranties set forth in SECTION 3.1 (Organization),
SECTION 3.2 (Authority), SECTION 3.4 (Capitalization), SECTION 3.15
(Environmental Matters), SECTION 3.16 (Employee Benefit Matters), SECTION
3.17 (Taxes), SECTION 3.22 (Brokers), SECTION 3.26 (Products Liability),
SECTION 4.1 (Organization), SECTION 4.2 (Ownership of Stock of the Parent and
Indebtedness) or SECTION 4.3 (Authority; Effect of Agreement) (the "SPECIAL
REPRESENTATIONS   47   AND WARRANTIES") or to breaches of SECTION
6.3(a)-(d) or SECTION 6.3(o) (the "SPECIAL PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS"); PROVIDED
FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the Lenders\' and the Parent\'s aggregate liability in
respect of breaches of, or inaccuracies in, the Special Representations and
Warranties and the Special Pre-Closing Covenants shall not exceed the
Purchase Price Cap (as defined below).   (e) Except as provided in SECTION
11.2(j) below, in no event will the aggregate liability of the Parent and the
Lenders hereunder exceed the aggregate amount of $60,000,000 (the "PURCHASE
PRICE CAP").   (f) It is understood and agreed that the parties
have entered into the Escrow Agreement to provide funds for any amounts due
to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this ARTICLE XI. In the event any
Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Parent
and the Lenders agree to execute written instructions to the Escrow Agent
directing that funds be disbursed under the Escrow Agreement to satisfy
such indemnification obligation. Until the disbursement in full of the Escrow
Amount (upon the termination of the Escrow Agreement or otherwise), making a
claim for the distribution from the Escrow Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy available to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any claims
under SECTION 11.2(a)(i), SECTION 11.2(a)(ii) and SECTION 11.2(a)(iii)
hereof. Except for the Buyer pursuant to SECTION 2.2(a)(i), no Person
(including, without limitation, the Parent or the Lenders and each of their
affiliates) shall have any obligation to fund the Escrow Account.   (g) For
purposes of determining (i) the existence of any misrepresentation or breach
of warranty under ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV hereof (other than SECTION 3.6(c)
(Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities), the first sentence of
SECTION 3.7 (Absence of Certain Changes or Events) and the third sentence of
SECTION 3.25 (Relationship with Suppliers)) and the existence of any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty pursuant to the Seller
Closing Certificate (other than SECTION 3.6(c) (Financial Statements;
Undisclosed Liabilities), the first sentence of SECTION 3.7 (Absence of
Certain Changes or Events) and the third sentence of SECTION 3.25
(Relationship with Suppliers)), and (ii) calculating the amount of any Losses
incurred in connection with any such misrepresentation or breach of warranty,
in each case, all references to materiality or Material Adverse Effect (or
other correlative terms) shall be disregarded (it being understood that
qualifiers expressed as a specific dollar threshold shall not be considered
such a reference).   (h) Notwithstanding SECTION 11.2(a) above, in the
event that between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date there
occurs any event or circumstance giving rise to a Material Adverse Effect
that is disclosed on the Seller Closing Certificate and the Buyer waives its
rights under SECTION 7.8 and the Closing occurs, the Buyer shall not be
entitled to indemnification under SECTION 11.2(a)(i) in respect of the event
or circumstance giving rise to the Material Adverse Effect.   (i) No right
of indemnification hereunder shall be limited by reason of any investigation
or audit conducted before or after the Closing or the knowledge of any party
of any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the
other party at any time, or the decision of any party to complete the
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer shall
have the right, irrespective of any knowledge or investigation of the Buyer
(or its affiliates, agents or representatives), to   48   rely fully on
the representations, warranties and covenants of the Lender, the Parent and
the Company contained herein.   (j) Notwithstanding anything contained in
this ARTICLE XI or in ARTICLE X, no limitation or condition of liability
provided for in SECTION 11.1 or this SECTION 11.2 (including paragraphs (c),
(d), (e), (f) or (h) above) shall apply in the event of fraud.   (k)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (other
than paragraph (j) above), the Buyer shall have no right to indemnification
hereunder with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss (i) to the extent such
Loss or alleged Loss was recovered through the calculation of Cash, Net
Working Capital, Net Working Capital Adjustment, Indebtedness or Transaction
Expenses or (ii) if the Buyer shall have requested a reduction in the Net
Working Capital calculation contained in the Preliminary Statement on account
of any matter forming the basis for such Loss or alleged Loss and the Parent
and the Buyer subsequently agree or the Dispute Resolution
Auditor determines, in each case, that the Buyer is not entitled to such a
reduction.   (l) The Lenders and the Parent hereby waive and release the
Company from any common law, equitable or other right of contribution
or other claims the Lenders or the Parent might have against the Company
arising out of or relating to any indemnification of the Buyer or the Company
or any other party referred to in this SECTION 11.2 by the Lenders and the
Parent for a breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties
or covenants in this Agreement or in any document or instrument executed in
connection with this Agreement.   (m) (i) A party entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall herein be referred to as an "INDEMNITEE." A
party obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee hereunder shall herein be referred
to as an "INDEMNITOR." As soon as is reasonable after an Indemnitee receives
notice of any claim or the commencement of any action by any third party that
such Indemnitee reasonably believes may give rise to a claim for
indemnification from an Indemnitor hereunder (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), such
Indemnitee shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an
Indemnitor under ARTICLE XI hereof, notify such Indemnitor in writing of such
claim, action or Loss, as the case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that failure to
notify Indemnitor shall not relieve Indemnitor of its indemnity obligation,
except to the extent Indemnitor is actually prejudiced in its defense of the
action by such failure. Any such notification must be in writing and must
state in reasonable detail the nature and basis of the claim, action or Loss,
to the extent known. Except as provided in this SECTION 11.2 or SECTION 1.5,
Indemnitor shall have the right using counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee to contest, defend, litigate or settle any such Third Party Claim
that primarily involves monetary damages; PROVIDED that the Indemnitor shall
have notified the Indemnitee in writing of its intention to do so within
thirty (30) days of the Indemnitee having given notice of the Third Party
Claim to the Indemnitor; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that (1) the Indemnitor confirms
in such notice to the Indemnitee that, as between the Indemnitor and the
Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall be obligated to satisfy and discharge the
Third Party Claim and (2) if reasonably requested to do so by the Indemnitee,
the Indemnitor shall have made reasonably adequate provision to ensure the
Indemnitee of the financial ability of the Indemnitor to satisfy the full
amount of any adverse monetary judgment that may result from such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnitee is a
Buyer Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor shall not have the right to assume
the   49   defense or control the settlement of any Third Party Claim
unless such Indemnitor would be obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder for an amount in excess of 50% of the damages alleged pursuant to
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in
and be consulted in, and to be apprised of all material developments in, and
to be represented by counsel (at its own expense) in, any such contest,
defense, litigation or settlement conducted by the Indemnitor. If the
Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, then the Indemnitor
shall be entitled to settle such claim; PROVIDED, that, the Indemnitor shall
obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee before entering into any
settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a
result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief
will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such settlement does not
expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Indemnitee withholds its consent to any settlement of a claim or the ceasing
of the defense of a claim to which it is entitled to consent pursuant to this
SECTION 11.2(m), and such claim is ultimately resolved (whether through
settlement, judgment or otherwise) for an amount greater than the amount
proposed at the time the Indemnitee\'s consent was initially requested,
Indemnitor shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee for such excess
amount; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that following such withholding of consent the
Indemnitee shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such
claim (at the Indemnitor\'s expense) and, if the Indemnitee succeeds in
resolving such claim (whether through settlement, judgment or otherwise) for
an amount less than that proposed by the Indemnitor (it being understood the
Indemnitee may agree to such settlement without the consent of the
Indemnitor), the Indemnitor shall indemnify the Indemnitee for such
difference even if such difference would otherwise not be indemnifiable under
Section 11.2(c) as amounts representing all or part of the Deductible. All
expenses (including attorneys\' fees) incurred by the Indemnitor
in connection with the foregoing shall be paid by the Indemnitor. No failure
by an Indemnitor to acknowledge in writing its indemnification obligations
under this ARTICLE XI shall relieve it of such obligations to the extent such
obligations exist.   (ii) If an Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification in respect of a Third Party Claim, and the Indemnitor fails
to (or is not entitled to) accept a tender of, or assume the defense of, a
Third Party Claim pursuant to this SECTION 11.2, the Indemnitor shall not be
entitled, and shall lose its right, to contest, defend, litigate and settle
such a Third Party Claim, and the Indemnitee shall have the right, without
prejudice to its right of indemnification hereunder, in its discretion
exercised in good faith, to contest, defend and litigate such Third Party
Claim, and may settle such Third Party Claim either before or after the
initiation of litigation upon written consent of the Indemnitor (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in and be
consulted in, and to be represented by counsel (at its own expense) in, any
such contest, defense, litigation or settlement conducted by the
Indemnitee.   11.3. INSURANCE AND TAXES. The amount due as indemnification
with respect to any claim under this ARTICLE XI shall take into account and
shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance or indemnification proceeds
actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party,
as applicable, in respect of the subject matter of such claim (after
deducting any costs of recovery); PROVIDED that the amount of any increase in
insurance premium or retroactive premiums or premium adjustments (and any out
of pocket expenses) resulting from the making of a claim or claims against
insurers shall, for this purpose, be deemed to be deducted from the amount so
paid by   50   such insurers. Any amount due as indemnification under
this ARTICLE XI or ARTICLE X shall (a) be increased on account of any Tax
detriment actually incurred by the Indemnified Party upon the receipt or
accrual of such indemnification payment and (b) be reduced on account of any
Tax benefit actually realized on account of the payment or accrual of any
loss incurred with respect to which such indemnification payment is made;
PROVIDED that the treatment of an indemnification payment as an adjustment to
the Final Purchase Price pursuant to SECTION 11.5 or the treatment of an
indemnified Loss as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price shall not be
either a Tax detriment or a Tax benefit.   11.4. SOLE REMEDY. Except as
otherwise provide in SECTION 1.3 (Closing Balance Sheet Calculation), Section
1.4 (Post-Closing Adjustment Payment) and SECTION 6.12 (Non-Compete), the
indemnification provided for in this ARTICLE XI and ARTICLE X shall be the
sole remedy of the parties hereto and their respective successors or assigns
in respect of any claim for damages arising under or out of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this SECTION 11.4 shall not
apply to Losses resulting from fraud; PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that the
rights of indemnification provided under this ARTICLE XI and ARTICLE X shall
be in addition to any right the Buyer may have to specific performance under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Nothing herein is intended to
limit any of the Buyer\'s rights under the Escrow Agreement.   11.5.
TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. Any payments made to a Buyer Indemnified
Party or a Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, pursuant to this ARTICLE
XI or ARTICLE X shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase
Price.   11.6. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE BUYER. The Buyer acknowledges that
it has conducted to its satisfaction an independent investigation and
verification of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Company. In making
its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Buyer has relied on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification and the representations and warranties of the
Parent, the Lenders and the Company expressly and specifically set forth in
this Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedules attached hereto. Such
representations and warranties by the Parent, the Lenders and the Company
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
Parent, the Lenders and the Company to the Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Buyer understands, acknowledges and
agrees that all other representations and warranties of any kind or nature
express or implied are specifically disclaimed by the Parent, the Lenders and
the Company.   11.7. DISCLOSURE GENERALLY. All Disclosure Schedules
attached hereto are incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this
Agreement as though completely set forth herein. Unless otherwise stated
herein, all references to this Agreement herein or in any of the Disclosure
Schedules (and Updated Schedules) shall be deemed to refer to this entire
Agreement, including all Disclosure Schedules (and Updated Schedules).  
51    ARTICLE XII  MISCELLANEOUS   12.1. INTERPRETIVE PROVISIONS.  
(a) Whenever used in this Agreement, (i) "INCLUDING" (or any variation
thereof) means including without limitation and (ii) any reference to gender

Chief Executive Officer     62    EXHIBIT A     INVENTORY PURCHASE
AGREEMENT     BY AND AMONG   AMERICAN SANITARY INCORPORATED,   AMSAN,
LLC   AND   INTERLINE BRANDS, INC.   DATED MAY 23, 2006    
A-1     INVENTORY PURCHASE AGREEMENT   This Inventory Purchase Agreement
(this "AGREEMENT") is dated May 23, 2006, by and among American Sanitary
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("SELLER"), AmSan, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the "COMPANY"), and Interline Brands, Inc., a New
Jersey corporation (the "BUYER"). All capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Purchase
Agreement (as defined below).   RECITALS   WHEREAS, Buyer, the Company,
Seller, Golder, Thoma, Cressey, Rauner Fund V, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership, GTCR Associates V, a Delaware general partnership, and GTCR
Capital Partners L.P., a Delaware limited partnership are parties to that
certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 23, 2006 (the
"PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which Buyer has acquired all of the
limited liability company interests of the Company from Seller;   WHEREAS,
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement
and as a condition to the Closing under the Purchase Agreement, Buyer has
agreed to, at the request of Seller, purchase the Inventory (as defined
below) from the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein.   NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree
as follows:  1. AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE; PURCHASE PRICE  1.1 AGREEMENT TO
PURCHASE   Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement,
the Buyer hereby purchases and the Company hereby sells all of the Company\'s
right, title, and interest in and to all of the Inventory.   On or before
the fifth (5th) business day preceding the Closing, the Buyer and Seller (and
their respective Agents) shall jointly conduct a physical count of the
Inventory to confirm each item of Inventory.   For purposes of this
Agreement, "INVENTORY" means the inventory of the Company included in the
Excluded Assets and more specifically described on SCHEDULE 1 attached
hereto, reflecting the physical inventory count described above and which
such Schedule the Seller has prepared in good faith, consistent with the
methodologies of the Company normally employed in computing such amounts to
accurately reflect (i) the "cost," "fair market value" and SKU for each item
of Inventory set forth thereon and (ii) the amount reserved, for financial
statement purposes, against such Inventory as of the date hereof
(the "ESTIMATED INVENTORY RESERVE AMOUNT").   A-2   1.2 PURCHASE
PRICE   The purchase price for the Inventory will be 90% of the
amount determined by subtracting (ii) from (i), where (i) equals the amount
determined pursuant to Schedule 1 by aggregating the lower of the "cost" or
"fair market value" (each as finally determined below) for each item of
Inventory listed thereon (the "INVENTORY Value"), and (ii) equals the
Inventory Reserve Amount (as defined and finally determined below) (the
"INVENTORY PURCHASE PRICE").  1.3 CLOSING   The closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place on the Closing
Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement).   At the Closing, the Buyer
shall out of its own proceeds and not out of cash of the Company existing on
or before the Closing deliver to Seller an amount equal to 90% of the amount
determined by subtracting (ii) from (i), where (i) equals the amount
determined pursuant to Schedule 1 by aggregating the lower of the "cost" or
"fair market value" for each item of Inventory listed thereon (the "ESTIMATED
INVENTORY VALUE") and (ii) equals the Estimated Inventory Reserve Amount
(such amount, the "CLOSING INVENTORY PURCHASE PRICE") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller.   Within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Seller a
statement (the "INVENTORY STATEMENT") illustrating Buyer\'s calculation of
the Inventory Value and Inventory Reserve Amount. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Inventory Reserve Amount" means the amount of reserve
against Inventory as of the Closing. The Inventory Statement shall be
prepared and the "Inventory Value" and "Inventory Reserve Amount" shall be
determined in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods,
policies, principles, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodology as were used in
preparation of the 2005 Balance Sheet or, to the extent applicable, in
accordance with any changes to such accounting methods, policies, principles,
practices and procedures that are documented in the Company\'s and Seller\'s
books and records as of December 31, 2005, not including any changes in
assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other
changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. The parties agree that the purpose of
preparing the Inventory Statement and determining the Inventory Value, the
Inventory Reserve Amount and the related purchase price adjustment
contemplated by this section is to measure the Inventory Purchase Price and
such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different
judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the
Inventory Statement or determining the Inventory Value and the Inventory
Reserve Amount (apart from updating to reflect the physical count referred to
above). After delivery of the Inventory Statement, Seller and its accountants
shall be permitted reasonable access during normal business hours of the
Company or the Buyer, as the case may be and upon reasonable notice to
appropriate Buyer personnel and to review the books and records and work
papers related to the preparation of the Inventory Statement;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Seller shall not use or permit to be used such
information other than for purposes of this SECTION 1.3 and shall not
disclose or permit to be disclosed such information (other than to its Agents
for purposes of this SECTION 1.3), except as required by law or legal
process, and it shall be a condition to the granting of such access to any
work papers, that the Seller   A-3   and its representatives execute any
releases and indemnity agreements customarily required by the Buyer\'s or the
Company\'s accountants, as the case may be, for such access. The Seller and
its accountants may reasonably make inquiries of the Buyer and the Company
and their respective accountants or other Agents regarding questions
concerning or disagreements with the Inventory Statement arising in the
course of their review thereof, and Buyer shall use its, and shall cause the
Company to use its, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
accountants to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. If the Seller
has any objections to the Inventory Statement, the Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its objections thereto
(an "OBJECTIONS STATEMENT"). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to
the Buyer within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Inventory Statement,
then the Inventory Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by
the parties hereto. The Seller and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution
within 30 days after the delivery of the Objections Statement, the Seller and
the Buyer shall submit such dispute to a mutually agreeable third party that
is not a public accounting firm. Any further communications with the Dispute
Resolution Auditor must be written and delivered to each party to
the dispute. The Dispute Resolution Auditor shall consider only those items
and amounts that are identified in the Objections Statement as being items
that the Seller and the Buyer are unable to resolve. The Dispute Resolution
Auditor\'s determination will be based solely on the definitions of Inventory
Value and Inventory Reserve Amount hereunder. Seller and the Buyer shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Auditor
to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable. Further, the
Dispute Resolution Auditor\'s determination shall be based solely on the
presentations by the Seller and the Buyer that are in accordance with the
terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of
an independent review). The resolution of the dispute by the Dispute
Resolution Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties
hereto, and judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Dispute
Resolution Auditor in any court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to be enforced. The costs and expenses of the
Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be allocated between the Seller and the
Buyer based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party.
For example, if the Seller claims the Inventory Reserve Amount is $1,000 less
than the amount determined by the Buyer\'s accountants, and the Seller
contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Buyer, and if the Dispute
Resolution Auditor ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to the Buyer
$300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration will
be allocated 60% (i.e., 300 / 500) to the Seller and 40% (i.e., 200 / 500) to
the Buyer.   If the Inventory Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant
to this Section 1.3 is greater than the Closing Inventory Purchase Price,
then the Buyer shall promptly (but in any event within five (5) business days
of such determination) deliver to the Seller the amount of such difference by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by the Seller, together with interest thereon from the Closing
Date to the date of actual payment at a variable rate equal to the prime rate
(as reported in the WALL STREET JOURNAL "MONEY RATES") from and including the
Closing Date to, but not including, the date of payment. If the Inventory
Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.3 is less
than the Closing Inventory Purchase Price, then Seller shall promptly (but in
any event within five (5) business days of such determination) pay to the
Buyer the amount of such difference by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more accounts designated by the Buyer, together with interest
thereon from the   A-4   Closing Date to the date of actual payment at a
variable rate equal to the prime rate (as reported in the WALL STREET JOURNAL
"MONEY RATES") from and including the Closing Date to, but not including, the
date of payment.   The Closing Inventory Purchase Price as adjusted, if at
all, by this section, shall be the Inventory Purchase Price.  1.4 CLOSING
OBLIGATIONS   At the Closing:   The Company shall deliver the Inventory to
Buyer by making such Inventory available for Buyer to take possession thereof
at facilities of the Company (other than the Excluded Facilities (as defined
in the Purchase Agreement)) as are reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Such
Inventory will be segregated and held apart from any other inventory of the
Company at such facilities.   Buyer shall deliver the Closing Inventory
Purchase Price to Seller, on behalf of the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
Seller.  1.5 DISCLAIMER OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   Except as
expressly set forth in this ARTICLE 0, Seller makes no representation or
warranty, express or implied, at law or in equity, in respect of any of the
Inventory, including, with respect to merchantability or fitness for any
particular purpose, and any such other representations or warranties are
hereby expressly disclaimed. The Company and Buyer, as the case may
be, hereby acknowledge and agree that, except to the extent specifically set
forth in this ARTICLE 0, the Company or Buyer, as the case may be, is
purchasing the Inventory on an "as-is, where-is" basis.  2.
COVENANTS  2.1 FURTHER ASSURANCES   The parties shall cooperate reasonably
with each other and with each other party\'s Agents in connection with any
steps required to be taken as part of their respective obligations under this
Agreement, and shall (i) furnish upon request to each other such further
information; (ii) execute and deliver to each other such other documents; and
(iii) do such other acts and things, all as the other party may reasonably
request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.  2.2 WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE  
Compliance with the provisions of this Agreement may be waived only by a
written instrument specifically referring to this Agreement and signed by
the party waiving such compliance. No course of dealing, nor any failure or
delay in exercising any right, will be construed as a waiver, and no single
or partial exercise of a right will preclude any other or further exercise of
that or any other right.   A-5   2.3 ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND
MODIFICATION   Other than the Purchase Agreement (which supplements the
terms and provisions of this Agreement), this Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, whether written or oral, between or among the parties with
respect to its subject matter and constitutes (along with the relevant
provisions of the Purchase Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of
the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to its subject
matter. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented, or otherwise
modified except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged
with such amendment.  2.4 ASSIGNMENTS AND SUCCESSORS; NO THIRD-PARTY
RIGHTS   No party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of
its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply
to, be binding in all respects upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors, and permitted assigns of the parties. Nothing expressed or
referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than
the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement,
except such rights as shall inure to an heir, successor, or permitted
assignee pursuant to this SECTION 0.  2.5 SEVERABILITY   If any provision
of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or
unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to
the extent not held invalid or unenforceable.  2.6 CONSTRUCTION   The
headings of Articles and Sections in this Agreement are provided for
convenience only and will not affect its construction or
interpretation.  2.7 GOVERNING LAW   This Agreement will be governed by
and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
conflicts-of-laws principles that would require the application of any other
law.  2.8 EXECUTION OF AGREEMENT   This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of
this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to
constitute the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this Agreement by
facsimile or electronic mail transmission shall constitute effective
execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may be used in
lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the parties
transmitted by facsimile or electronic mail shall be deemed to be their
original signatures for all purposes.   A-6   2.9 BULK TRANSFER LAWS  
Each of Seller and Buyer acknowledge that Seller will not comply with the
provisions of any bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller will indemnify
Buyer for any such noncompliance.   * * * * * * * * *     A-7

delivered by certified mail to the Parent in accordance with Section 9(a).

investment for any moneys in the Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent may deposit
such moneys into an interest bearing account at the Escrow Agent (or any
other bank acceptable to the Escrow Agent in its reasonable judgment), such

mature, and the funds invested immediately available, on each one month

a sufficient amount of the Permitted Investments to be converted into

not be liable for any depreciation in the value of any investment made

such investment.   f. Pursuant to Section 671 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, the Parent is intended to be, and shall be treated
as, the owner for income tax purposes of the Escrow Funds (and any other
corpus and income held in the Escrow Account) and of all of the items of
income, deductions and credits attributable to the Escrow Funds (and
attributable to all of such other corpus and interest). The provisions of
this Escrow Agreement shall be construed and interpreted accordingly, and all
parties hereto shall file tax returns and statements consistent with such
treatment, it being understood that the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible
for any tax reporting responsibilities of the Parent or the Buyer.   6.
WITH ESCROW AGENT. To induce Escrow Agent to act hereunder, it is agreed by
the Parent and the Buyer that:   a. the Escrow Agent may act in reliance
upon any instrument or signature furnished to it hereunder and which it, in
good faith, believed to be genuine and may assume that any person purporting
to give any writing, notice, advice or instruction in connection with the
provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.   b. the Escrow Agent
may act relative hereto upon advice of reputable counsel in reference to any
matter connected herewith, and shall not be liable to any of the parties
hereto, or their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and
assigns, for any action taken in good faith on the advice of reputable
counsel or for any mistake of fact or error of   B-5   judgment, or for
any acts or omissions of any kind taken or made in good faith unless caused
by its willful misconduct or negligence.   c. This Escrow Agreement sets
forth exclusively the duties of the Escrow Agent with respect to any and all
matters pertinent hereto and no implied duties or obligations shall be read
into this Escrow Agreement against the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall
not be bound by, nor charged with knowledge of, any other agreement,
including the Securities Purchase Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules
thereto.   d. The Escrow Agent does not have and will not have any interest
in the Escrow Funds but is serving only as escrow holder and has
only possession thereof.   The Parent and the Buyer hereby release the
Escrow Agent from any act done or omitted to be done by the Escrow Agent in
good faith in the performance of its duties hereunder, and the Parent and the
Buyer, jointly and severally, hereby agree to indemnify Escrow Agent for, and
to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or reasonable expense
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) actually incurred by the
Escrow Agent, arising out of or in connection with its entering into this
Escrow Agreement and carrying out its duties hereunder, including the
reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself from any claim or
liability; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Escrow Agent shall not be entitled to
indemnification hereunder for losses, liabilities and expenses which arise
out of the willful misconduct or negligence of the Escrow Agent. The Parent
and the Buyer agree that any payments made to Escrow Agent under the
indemnification obligation in the immediately preceding sentence, whether
made by Parent, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the other hand, or both,
are to be borne in equal amounts by Parent, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on
the other hand, and hereby grant to each other a right of contribution to
effect the same. The agreements contained in the two immediately preceding
sentences shall survive despite any termination of this Escrow Agreement or
the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.   e. The Escrow Agent shall
receive reasonable compensation for the performance of its duties hereunder;
PROVIDED, however, that in no event shall (i) the initial acceptance fee
exceed $ __________ and (ii) the annual administration, transaction and other
fees exceed $ _________ per year in the aggregate. The Escrow Agent shall be
reimbursed for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred in
connection with the performance of its duties hereunder. Each of Parent and
Buyer shall be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the fees and costs
provided for in this Section 6(e), which shall be paid [within thirty (30)
days after the date hereof.]   7. RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL OF THE ESCROW
AGENT. The Escrow Agent, and any successor Escrow Agent, may resign at any
time as the Escrow Agent hereunder by giving at least 30 days\' written
notice to the Parent and the Buyer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Escrow
Agent\'s resignation shall not be effective unless and until a successor
Escrow Agent is appointed and the Escrow Agent delivers the Escrow Funds to
such successor. Upon such resignation, the resigning Escrow Agent shall be
absolved from any and all liability in connection with the exercise of its
powers and duties as Escrow Agent hereunder except for liability arising in
connection with its negligence or willful misconduct. Upon their receipt of
notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent, the Parent and the Buyer shall
use reasonable efforts to designate a successor   B-6   Escrow Agent. In
the event the Parent and the Buyer do not agree upon a successor Escrow Agent
within 30 days after the receipt of such notice, the Escrow Agent so
resigning may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Escrow Agent located within the territorial United
States or other appropriate relief and any such resulting appointment shall
be binding upon all parties hereto. By mutual written agreement, the Parent
and the Buyer shall have the right to terminate their appointment of
the Escrow Agent, or successor Escrow Agent, as Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent or successor Escrow Agent shall continue to act as Escrow Agent until a
successor is appointed and qualified to act as Escrow Agent.   8.
SUBSTITUTION OF THE ESCROW AGENT. In the event any Escrow Agent ceases to do
business in the City of New York, the Buyer shall have the right to terminate
the appointment of the Escrow Agent as Escrow Agent hereunder by giving
written notice to the parties hereto and to appoint a substitute Escrow
Agent, which substitute Escrow Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Parent.   9. MISCELLANEOUS.   a. NOTICES. Any notice, request,
instruction, or other document to be given hereunder by any party hereto to
any other party shall be in writing and shall be given by delivery in person,

EXHIBIT F-1    __________ ___, 2006  Interline Brands, Inc. 801 West Bay
Street THIS OPINION IS SUBJECT TO Jacksonville, FL 32204 REVIEW,
MODIFICATION, AND  APPROVAL BY  THE KIRKLAND and ELLIS LLP  OPINION
COMMITTEE   Ladies and Gentlemen:   We are issuing this opinion letter in
our capacity as special legal counsel to Golder, Thoma, Cressey, Rauner Fund
V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("FUND V"), GTCR Associates V, a
Delaware general partnership ("ASSOCIATES V"), GTCR Capital Partners, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership ("CAPITAL PARTNERS" and together with Fund V and
Associates V, the "LENDERS ") in response to the requirement in Section 7.6
of the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "MAIN AGREEMENT") dated as of May
___, 2006, by and among the Lenders, American Sanitary Incorporated, a
Delaware corporation, AmSan, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and
Interline Brands, Inc. a New Jersey corporation (herein called "you"). The
term "Transaction Documents" whenever it is used in this letter means the
Main Agreement and the following additional agreements: the Escrow Agreement
and the Inventory Purchase Agreement.   Subject to the assumptions,
qualifications, exclusions and other limitations which are identified in this
letter and in the schedules attached to this letter, we advise you, and, with
respect to each legal issue addressed in this letter, it is our opinion,
that:  1. Each of Fund V and Capital Partners is a limited partnership
existing  and in good standing under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited 
Partnership Act.  2. Each of Fund V and Capital Partners was duly organized
under the  Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act.  3. Associates
V is a Delaware general partnership existing and in good  standing under the
Delaware Revised Uniform Partnership Act.  4. Associates V was duly
organized under the Delaware Revised Uniform  Partnership Act.  5. Each of
the Lenders has the partnership power to enter into and  perform its
respective obligations under the Main Agreement.  6. Each of the Lenders\'
respective execution, delivery and performance of  the Main Agreement has
been duly authorized by all necessary  partnership action of such
Lender.  7. Each of the Lenders has duly executed and delivered the Main 
Agreement.   F-1-1   8. The Main Agreement is a valid and binding
obligation of each of the  Lenders enforceable against each such Lender in
accordance with its  terms.  9. Each of the Lenders\' execution and
delivery of the Main Agreement and  the performance of its agreements therein
will not violate such  Lender\'s partnership agreement.   In preparing this
letter, we have relied without any independent verification upon the
assumptions recited in SCHEDULE B to this letter and upon: (i) information
contained in certificates obtained from governmental authorities; (ii)
factual information represented to be true in the Transaction Documents;
(iii) factual information provided to us in a Support Certificate executed by
each of the Lenders; and (iv) factual information we have obtained from such
other sources as we have deemed reasonable. We have assumed
without investigation that there has been no relevant change or development
between the dates as of which the information cited in the preceding sentence
was given and the date of this letter and that the information upon which we
have relied is accurate and does not omit disclosures necessary to prevent
such information from being misleading.   While we have not conducted any
independent investigation to determine facts upon which our opinions are
based or to obtain information about which this letter advises you, we
confirm that we do not have any actual knowledge which has caused us to
conclude that our reliance and assumptions cited in the preceding paragraph
are unwarranted or that any information supplied in this letter is wrong. The
terms "ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE", "KNOWLEDGE" and "AWARE" whenever used in this
letter with respect to our firm mean conscious awareness at the time this
letter is delivered on the date it bears by the following Kirkland and Ellis
LLP lawyers who have had significant involvement with negotiation
or preparation of the Transaction Documents (herein called "OUR
DESIGNATED TRANSACTION LAWYERS"): Stephen L. Ritchie, P.C., Michael H. Weed
and Kevin L. Morris.   Our advice on every legal issue addressed in this
letter (collectively, "OUR OPINIONS") is based exclusively on such internal
law of the State of New York or such federal law of the United States (except
as otherwise specifically provided in the following sentences of this
paragraph) which, in each case, is in our experience normally applicable to
general business corporations not engaged in regulated business activities
and to transactions of the type contemplated by the Transaction Documents but
without our having made any special investigation as to any other laws,
except that we express no opinion or advice as to any law identified on
SCHEDULE C. For purposes of the opinions in paragraphs 1 and 3, we have
relied exclusively upon the certificates issued by the governmental
authorities in the applicable jurisdictions, and such opinions are not
intended to provide any conclusion or assurance beyond that conveyed by such
certificates. The opinions in paragraph 2 are based solely upon the
provisions of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act and the
opinions in paragraph 4 are based solely upon the provisions of the Delaware
Revised Uniform Partnership Act. We advise you that we are not Delaware
attorneys and do not practice law under such partnership statutes, and, we
have rendered the opinions in paragraphs 2 and 4 based exclusively on our
review of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act and the
Delaware Revised Uniform Partnership Act, respectively. We advise you that
issues addressed by this letter may be governed in whole or in part by other
laws, but we express no opinion as to whether any relevant difference exists
between the laws upon which our opinions are based and any other laws which
may actually govern. Our opinions are subject to all qualifications in  
F-1-2   SCHEDULE A and do not cover or otherwise address any law or legal
issue which is identified in the attached SCHEDULE C or any provision in the
Transaction Documents of any type identified in SCHEDULE D. Provisions in the
Transaction Documents which are not excluded by SCHEDULE D or any other part
of this letter or its attachments are called the "RELEVANT AGREEMENT
TERMS."   Except to the extent set forth in the preceding paragraph, each of
our opinions represents our opinion as to how the issue addressed in such
opinion would be resolved were it to be considered by the highest court of
the jurisdiction upon whose law our opinion on that issue is based. The
manner in which any particular issue would be treated in any actual court
case would depend in part on facts and circumstances particular to the case,
and this letter is not intended to guarantee the outcome of any legal dispute
which may arise in the future. It is possible that some Relevant Agreement
Terms may not prove enforceable for reasons other than those cited in this
letter should an actual enforcement action be brought.   This letter speaks
as of the time of its delivery on the date it bears. We do not assume any
obligation to provide you with any subsequent opinion or advice by reason of
any fact about which our Designated Transaction Lawyers did not have actual
knowledge at that time, by reason of any change subsequent to that time in
any law covered by any of our opinions, or for any other reason. The attached
schedules are an integral part of this letter, and any term defined in this
letter or any schedule has that defined meaning wherever it is used in this
letter or in any schedule to this letter.   You may rely upon this letter
only for the purpose served by the provision in the Main Agreement cited in
the initial paragraph of this letter in response to which it has been
delivered. Without our written consent: (i) no person other than you may rely
on this letter for any purpose; (ii) this letter may not be cited or quoted
in any financial statement, prospectus, private placement memorandum or other
similar document; (iii) this letter may not be cited or quoted in any other
document or communication which might encourage reliance upon this letter by
any person or for any purpose excluded by the restrictions in this paragraph;
and (iv) copies of this letter may not be furnished to anyone for purposes of
encouraging such reliance. This letter is not to be used, circulated, quoted,
relied upon or otherwise proffered for any other purpose, nor quoted or
referred to in any public document or filed with any governmental agency or
other person, without our express written consent, except that it may be
disclosed to, but not relied upon by, governmental agencies having
jurisdiction over you.   Sincerely,    Kirkland and Ellis LLP    
F-1-3    SCHEDULE A  GENERAL QUALIFICATIONS    All of our opinions
("our opinions") in the letter to which this Schedule is attached ("OUR
LETTER") are subject to each of the qualifications set forth in this
Schedule.  1. BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY EXCEPTION. Each of our opinions is
subject  to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership,  moratorium and other similar laws. This exception
includes:   (a) the Federal Bankruptcy Code and thus comprehends, among 
others, matters of turn-over, automatic stay, avoiding powers,  fraudulent
transfer, preference, discharge, conversion of a  non-recourse obligation
into a recourse claim, limitations on ipso  facto and anti-assignment clauses
and the coverage of pre-petition  security agreements applicable to property
acquired after a petition  is filed;   (b) all other Federal and state
bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, receivership, moratorium,
arrangement and assignment  for the benefit of creditors laws that affect the
rights of creditors  generally or that have reference to or affect only
creditors of  specific types of debtors;   (c) state fraudulent transfer
and conveyance laws; and   (d) judicially developed doctrines in this area,
such as  substantive consolidation of entities and equitable
subordination.  2. EQUITABLE PRINCIPLES LIMITATION. Each of our opinions is
subject to  the effect of general principles of equity, whether applied by a
court  of law or equity. This limitation includes principles:   (a)
governing the availability of specific performance,  injunctive relief or
other equitable remedies, which generally place  the award of such remedies,
subject to certain guidelines, in the  discretion of the court to which
application for such relief is made;   (b) affording equitable defenses
(e.g., waiver, laches and  estoppel) against a party seeking enforcement;  
(c) requiring good faith and fair dealing in the performance and  enforcement
of a contract by the party seeking its enforcement;   (d) requiring
reasonableness in the performance and enforcement  of an agreement by the
party seeking enforcement of the contract;   (e) requiring consideration of
the materiality of (i) a breach  and (ii) the consequences of the breach to
the party seeking  enforcement;   F-1-A-1    (f) requiring consideration
of the impracticability or  impossibility of performance at the time of
attempted enforcement; and   (g) affording defenses based upon the
unconscionability of the  enforcing party\'s conduct after the parties have
entered into the  contract.  3. OTHER COMMON QUALIFICATIONS. Each of our
opinions is subject to the  effect of rules of law that:   (a) limit or
affect the enforcement of provisions of a contract  that purport to waive, or
to require waiver of, the obligations of  good faith, fair dealing, diligence
and reasonableness;   (b) provide that forum selection clauses in contracts
are not  necessarily binding on the court(s) in the forum selected;   (c)
limit the availability of a remedy under certain  circumstances where another
remedy has been elected;   (d) provide a time limitation after which a
remedy may not be  enforced;   (e) limit the right of a creditor to use
force or cause a breach  of the peace in enforcing rights;   (f) relate to
the sale or disposition of collateral or the  requirements of a commercially
reasonable sale;   (g) limit the enforceability of provisions releasing,
exculpating  or exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a
party  for, liability for its own action or inaction, to the extent the 
action or inaction involves negligence, recklessness, willful  misconduct,
unlawful conduct or violation of public policy, or for  strict product
liability or for liabilities arising under the  securities laws, or which
limit the enforceability of provisions  requiring indemnification of a party
with respect to litigation  between such party and another party from whom
indemnification is  sought which is determined adversely to the party
seeking  indemnification;   (h) may, where less than all of a contract may
be unenforceable,  limit the enforceability of the balance of the contract
to  circumstances in which the unenforceable portion is not an essential 
part of the agreed exchange;   (i) govern and afford judicial discretion
regarding the  determination of damages and entitlement to attorneys\' fees
and other  costs;   (j) may permit a party that has materially failed to
render or  offer performance required by the contract to cure that failure
unless  (i) permitting a cure would unreasonably hinder the aggrieved party 
from making substitute arrangements for performance, or (ii) it was 
important in the circumstances to the aggrieved party that performance  occur
by the date stated in the contract; and   F-1-A-2    (k) limit the
enforceability requirements in the Transaction  Documents that provisions
therein may only be waived or amended in  writing, to the extent that an oral
agreement or an implied agreement  by trade practice or course of conduct has
been created modifying any  such provision.  4. REFERENCED PROVISION
QUALIFICATION. Each opinion regarding the  validity, binding effect or
enforceability of a provision (the "FIRST  PROVISION") in any of the
Transaction Documents requiring any party to  perform its obligations under,
or to cause any other person to perform  its obligations under, any other
provision (the "SECOND PROVISION") of  any Transaction Document, or stating
that any action will be taken as  provided in or in accordance with any such
Second Provision, are  subject to the same qualifications as the
corresponding opinion in  this letter relating to the validity, binding
effect and  enforceability of such Second Provision. Requirements in the 
Transaction Documents that provisions therein may only be waived or  amended
in writing may not be enforceable to the extent that an oral  agreement or an
implied agreement by trade practice or course of  conduct has been created
modifying any such provision.  5. LICENSING. We express no opinion with
regard to any licensing or  regulatory requirements relating to the Lenders\'
lines of business,  including any effects of any failure in any State or
States to be  licensed to conduct such business.     F-1-A-3   
SCHEDULE B  ASSUMPTIONS    For purposes of our letter, we have relied,
without investigation, upon each of the following assumptions:  1. The
Lenders have the requisite title and rights to any property  involved in the
transactions effected under the Transaction Documents  (herein called the
"Transactions").  2. You are existing and in good standing in your
jurisdiction of  organization.  3. The Transaction Documents constitute
valid and binding obligations of  yours and are enforceable against you in
accordance with their terms  (subject to qualifications, exclusions and other
limitations similar  to those applicable to our letter).  4. You have
satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to you  to the extent
necessary to make the Transaction Documents enforceable  against you.  5.
You have complied with all legal requirements pertaining to your  status as
such status relates to your rights to enforce the  Transaction Documents
against the Lenders.  6. Each document submitted to us for review is
accurate and complete,  each such document that is an original is authentic,
each such  document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and
all  signatures on each such document are genuine.  7. There has not been
any mutual mistake of fact or misunderstanding,  fraud, duress or undue
influence.  8. The conduct of the parties to the Transaction Documents has
complied  with any requirement of good faith, fair dealing and
conscionability.  9. You have acted in good faith and without notice of any
defense against  the enforcement of any rights created by, or adverse claim
to any  property or security interest transferred or created as part of the 
Transactions.  10. There are no agreements or understandings among the
parties to the  Transaction Documents, written or oral (other than the
Transaction  Documents), and there is no usage of trade or course or prior
dealing  among the parties that would, in either case, define, supplement
or  qualify the terms of the Transaction Documents.  11. The
constitutionality or validity of a relevant statute, rule,  regulation or
agency action is not in issue.  12. All parties to the Transaction Documents
will act in accordance with,  and will refrain from taking any action that is
forbidden by, the  terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents.  
F-1-B-1   13. All agreements other than the Transaction Documents (if any)
with  respect to which we have provided an opinion or advice in our letter 
or reviewed in connection with our letter would be enforced as 
written.  14. The Lenders will not in the future take any discretionary
action  (including a decision not to act) permitted under the Transaction 
Documents that would result in a violation of law or constitute a  breach or
default under any other agreements or court orders to which  such entities
may be subject.  15. The Lenders have obtained (and will in the future
obtain) all permits  and governmental approvals required, and have taken (and
will in the  future take) all actions required, relevant to the consummation
of the  Transactions or the performance of the Transaction Documents.  16.
All information required to be disclosed in connection with any  consent or
approval by the each of the Lenders\' partnership governing  group and all
other information required to be disclosed in connection  with any issue
relevant to our opinions has in fact been fully and  fairly disclosed to all
persons to whom it is required to be  disclosed. The representations made by
the Lenders in the Main  Agreement with respect to their respective
jurisdictions of  organization are true and correct.  17. Each of the
Lenders\' respective partnership agreements, all amendments  to such
agreements and all actions taken by the Lenders thereunder  have been adopted
in accordance with all applicable legal  requirements.  18. Each person who
has taken any action relevant to any of our opinions  in the capacity of
partner, director, principal or officer was duly  elected to that partner,
director, principal or officer position and  held that position when such
action was taken.    F-1-B-2    SCHEDULE C  EXCLUDED LAW AND LEGAL

Brands, Inc. THIS OPINION IS SUBJECT TO 801 West Bay Street REVIEW,
MODIFICATION, AND Jacksonville, FL 32204 APPROVAL BY  KILPATRICK STOCKTON
LLP   Ladies and Gentlemen:   We have acted as counsel to American
Sanitary Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("HOLDINGS") and AmSan, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the "COMPANY," and with Holdings,
sometimes collectively referred to as the "SELLERS") in connection with the
transaction contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of
even date herewith (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), among Holdings, the Company,
Golder, Thoma, Cressey, Rauner Fund V, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership,
GTCR Associates V, a Delaware general partnership, GTCR Capital Partners,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and Interline Brands, Inc.
("INTERLINE"). This opinion letter is delivered pursuant to Section 7.6 of
the Purchase Agreement. All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the same meanings as are ascribed to them in the
Purchase Agreement.   The term "TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS" whenever it is used
in this letter means the Purchase Agreement and the following additional
agreements, in each case in the form executed by the parties thereto on the
date hereof:   (i) the Escrow Agreement; and   (ii) the Inventory Purchase
Agreement.   We have reviewed such documents and considered such matters of
law and fact as we, in our professional judgment, have deemed appropriate to
render the opinions contained herein. With respect to certain facts, we have
considered it appropriate to rely upon certificates or other comparable
documents of public officials and officers or other appropriate
representatives of Holdings or the Company, without investigation or analysis
of any underlying data contained therein. In addition, we have relied,
without verification, on the assumptions set forth on SCHEDULE A.  
F-2-1    The phrases "to our knowledge" and "known to us" mean the
conscious awareness by lawyers in the primary lawyer group of factual matters
such lawyers recognize as being relevant to the opinion or confirmation
so qualified. Where any opinion or confirmation is qualified by the phrase
"to our knowledge" or "known to us," the lawyers in the primary lawyer group
are without knowledge, or conscious awareness, that the opinion or
confirmation is untrue. "Primary lawyer group" means any lawyer in this firm
(i) who signs this opinion letter, (ii) who is actively involved in
negotiating or documenting the transaction or (iii) solely as to information
relevant to a particular opinion or factual confirmation issue, who is
primarily responsible for providing the response concerning the particular
opinion or issue.   Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the further
assumptions, limitations and qualifications hereinafter expressed or set
forth on the Schedules, it is our opinion that:   1. Holdings is a
corporation existing and in good standing under  the laws of the State of
Delaware.   2. Holdings was duly organized under the laws of the State of 
Delaware.   3. The Company is a limited liability company existing and in 
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.   4. The Company was
duly formed under the laws of the State of  Delaware.   5. Holdings and the
Company each has the corporate or limited  liability company power, as
applicable, to execute, deliver  and perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents.   6. Holdings and the Company each has authorized the
execution,  delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents to  which
it is a party by all necessary corporate or limited  liability company
action, as applicable, and has duly  executed and delivered such Transaction
Documents.   7. The execution and delivery by Holdings of the Transaction 
Documents and the performance by Holdings of its obligations  therein, if it
were now to perform its obligations, do not  violate the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of  Holdings or the Delaware General Corporation
Law.   8. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction 
Documents and the performance by the Company of its  obligations, if it were
now to perform its obligations,  therein do not violate the certificate of
formation or  operating agreement of the Company or the Delaware Limited 
Liability Company Act.   9. The Transaction Documents to which Holdings and
the Company  each is a party are valid and binding obligations of Holdings 
and the Company, enforceable against Holdings and the Company  in accordance
with their terms.   The opinions expressed above in paragraphs numbered 1
and 3 are subject to the following qualifications and limitations:  
F-2-2    (a) In rendering our opinion that Holdings "is a corporation," 
"existing" and "in good standing," we have relied solely upon  a Certificate
of Existence regarding Holdings from the  Delaware Secretary of State dated
_______________.   (b) In rendering our opinion that the Company "is a
limited  liability company," "existing" and "in good standing," we  have
relied solely upon a Certificate of Existence regarding  the Company from the
Delaware Secretary of State dated  _______________.   Additionally, in
rendering our opinion set forth in paragraph numbered 2 above, we limited our
review of applicable law to the Delaware General Corporation Law, and in
rendering our opinion set forth in paragraph numbered 4 above, we limited our
review of applicable law to the Delaware Limited Liability Company Law. The
opinions set forth herein are otherwise limited to matters governed by the
laws of the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law and
Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. By rendering the opinions herein set
forth, we do not intend to indicate that we are experts on, or qualified to
render opinions on, the laws of any other jurisdiction. We express no opinion
concerning any matter respecting or affected by any laws other than laws that
a lawyer in New York exercising customary professional diligence would
reasonably recognize as being directly applicable to Holdings, the Company,
the Transaction Documents or all of them. Our opinions are subject to all
qualifications in SCHEDULE B and do not cover or otherwise address any law or
legal issue which is identified in the attached SCHEDULE C or any provision
in the Transaction Documents of any type identified in SCHEDULE D.   Each of
our opinions represents our opinion as to how the issue addressed in such
opinion would be resolved were it to be considered by the highest court of
the jurisdiction upon whose law our opinion on that issue is based. The
manner in which any particular issue would be treated in any actual court
case would depend in part on facts and circumstances particular to the case,
and this letter is not intended to guarantee the outcome of any legal dispute
which may arise in the future. It is possible that some relevant Transaction
Documents terms may not prove enforceable for reasons other than those cited
in this letter should an actual enforcement action be brought.   This letter
speaks as of the time of its delivery on the date it bears. We do not assume
any obligation to provide you with any subsequent opinion or advice by reason
of any fact about which our attorneys did not have actual knowledge at that
time, by reason of any change subsequent to that time in any law covered by
any of our opinions, or for any other reason. The attached schedules are an
integral part of this letter, and any term defined in this letter has that
defined meaning wherever it is used in this letter or in any schedule to this
letter.   This opinion letter is delivered solely for your benefit in
connection with the Transaction and may not be used or relied upon by any
other person or for any other purpose without our prior written consent in
each instance.   Very truly yours,   KILPATRICK STOCKTON LLP

taken  (and will in the future take) all actions required, relevant  to the
consummation of the transaction or the performance of  the Transaction

SCHEDULE B  GENERAL QUALIFICATIONS    Our opinion in the letter to which
this Schedule is attached is subject to each of the following
qualifications:   1. BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY EXCEPTION. This opinion is
subject  to the effect of applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, 
reorganization, receivership, fraudulent conveyance,  moratorium and similar
state or federal debtor relief laws  from time to time in effect and which
affect the enforcement  of creditors\' rights generally. This exception
includes:   (a) the Federal Bankruptcy Code and thus comprehends, among 
others, matters of turn-over, automatic stay, avoiding  powers, fraudulent
transfer, preference, discharge,  conversion of a non-recourse obligation
into a recourse  claim, limitations on ipso facto and anti-assignment 
clauses and the coverage of pre-petition security  agreements applicable to
property acquired after a  petition is filed;   (b) all other Federal and
state bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, receivership, moratorium,
arrangement and  assignment for the benefit of creditors laws that affect 
the rights of creditors generally or that have reference  to or affect only
creditors of specific types of debtors;   (c) state fraudulent transfer and
conveyance laws; and   (d) judicially developed doctrines in this area, such
as  substantive consolidation of entities and equitable  subordination.  
2. EQUITABLE PRINCIPLES LIMITATION. This opinion is subject both  to general
principles of equity and to considerations of  public policy, including the
requirement that the parties  thereto act with commercial reasonableness and
in good faith  to the extent required by applicable law, the application of 
which may deny certain rights and may be applied by a court  of proper
jurisdiction, regardless of whether such  enforceability is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at  law. For purposes of this paragraph, the terms
"general  principles of equity" and "considerations of public policy"  may
include, but are not limited to:   (a) issues related to the right to or
obligation of the  appointment of a receiver in certain circumstances;  
(b) the ability of an entity to appoint an attorney-in-fact;  fiduciary
obligations of attorneys-in-fact; the  enforceability of usury savings
clauses;   F-2-B-1    (c) waiver of procedural, substantive, or
constitutional  rights; disclaimers or limitations of liability;   (d)
waiver of defenses;   (e) the exercise of self-help or other remedies
without  judicial process;   (f) accounting for rent or sale proceeds;  
(g) requirements of mitigation of damages;   (h) excusing a party for
liability for its own acts;   (i) authorizing a party to act in its sole
discretion;   (j) imposition of liquidated damages; and   (k) enforcement
of default interest provisions.   Any provision waiving a right to jury
trial is unenforceable  as against public policy pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat.
ss.  22B-10.   3. OTHER COMMON QUALIFICATIONS.   Each of our opinions is
subject to the effect of rules of law  that:   (a) limit or affect the
enforcement of provisions of a  contract that purport to waive, or to require
waiver of,  the obligations of good faith, fair dealing, diligence  and
reasonableness;   (b) provide that forum selection clauses (e.g., consent
to  venue, jurisdiction or service of process) in contracts  are not
necessarily binding on the court(s) in the forum  selected;   (c) affect
the enforceability of any provision in the  Transaction Documents that
purports to make void any act  done in contravention thereof;   (d) limit
the availability of a remedy under certain  circumstances where another
remedy has been elected;   (e) limit the enforceability of any provision to
the extent  that such provision constitutes a waiver of illegality as  a
defense to performance of contract obligations;   (f) provide a time
limitation after which a remedy may not be  enforced;   F-2-B-2    (g)
limit the right of a creditor to use force or cause a  breach of the peace in
enforcing rights;   (h) relate to the sale or disposition of collateral or
the  requirements of a commercially reasonable sale;   (i) affect the
enforceability of any provision in the  Transaction Documents that purports
to authorize a party  to act in its sole discretion, that imposes penalties
or  late payment charges, or that relates to evidentiary  standards or other
standards by which the Transaction  Documents are to be construed;   (j)
limit the enforceability of provisions releasing,  exculpating or exempting a
party from, or requiring  indemnification of a party for, liability for its
own  action or inaction, to the extent the action or inaction  involves
negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct,  unlawful conduct or violation
of public policy, or for  strict product liability or for liabilities arising
under  the securities laws, or which limit the enforceability of  provisions
requiring indemnification of a party with  respect to litigation between such
party and another  party from whom indemnification is sought which is 
determined adversely to the party seeking  indemnification;   (k) limit the
enforcement of any guarantees, and limit the  effectiveness of any waiver by
the parties of their  rights;   (l) may, where less than all of a contract
may be  unenforceable, limit the enforceability of the balance of  the
contract to circumstances in which the unenforceable  portion is not an
essential part of the agreed exchange;   (m) govern and afford judicial
discretion regarding the  determination of damages and entitlement to
attorneys\'  fees and other costs;   (n) may permit a party that has
materially failed to render  or offer performance required by the contract to
cure  that failure unless (i) permitting a cure would  unreasonably hinder
the aggrieved party from making  substitute arrangements for performance, or
(ii) it was  important in the circumstances to the aggrieved party  that
performance occur by the date stated in the  contract;   (o) limit the
enforceability of any provisions contained in  the Transaction Documents that
require waiver or  amendments to be made only in writing, to the extent
that  an oral agreement or an implied agreement by trade  practice or course
of conduct has been created modifying  any such provision;   (p) affect
provisions, if any, in the Transaction Documents  to the effect that waiver
by a party of performance  obligations by another party shall not be deemed a
waiver  of such party\'s right thereafter to cause the applicable  document
to be in default may not be enforceable in all  circumstances, unless such
party shall (i) first provide   F-2-B-3    written notice to the other
party that subsequent  defaults will not be accepted and will result in a 
default, and (ii) thereafter, timely and diligently  pursue its default
remedies; and   (q) relate to the enforceability of any provisions
contained  in the Transaction Documents purporting to require a  party
thereto to pay or reimburse attorneys\' fees  incurred by another party, or
to indemnify another party  therefor, which provisions may be limited by
applicable  statutes and decisions relating to the collection and  award of
attorneys\' fees. North Carolina General Statutes  ss. 6-21.2 sets forth the
procedures and limitations  applicable to thE collection of attorneys\' fees
and,  accordingly, any provisions in the Transaction Documents  related to
the ability of any party to collect attorneys\'  fees upon default are
subject to those limitations.   4. LICENSING. We express no opinion with
regard to any licensing  or regulatory requirements relating to the Sellers\'
lines of  business, including any effects of any failure in any state  to be
licensed to conduct such business.      F-2-B-4    SCHEDULE C
