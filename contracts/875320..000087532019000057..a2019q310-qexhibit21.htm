Option that would have become vested had the holder remained in the employment
or service of the Company for the 12-month period commencing on the Closing
Date (such Options, the "Accelerated Options"), (ii) each Option described on

Option, Accelerated Option and each other outstanding Option) is immediately
terminated and canceled immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each
Optionholder will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except that
each holder of a Vested Option and each holder of an Accelerated Option will
have the right to receive his or her respective portion of the Merger
Consideration and Accelerated Option Consideration payable in accordance with
and in the manner provided by this Article II, subject to the limitations and
conditions in this Article II, and any other rights expressly provided by this
Agreement. Each Option that is not a Vested Option or an Accelerated Option
shall terminate without consideration therefor immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any Party, each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, which
will be the only shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation issued
and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time. Each stock certificate
of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of shares of common stock of Merger Sub
will thereafter evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any Party or any Equityholder, all Shares will no longer be
outstanding and will be canceled and retired automatically and will cease to
exist, and each Stockholder will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive his, her or its respective portion of the
Merger Consideration payable in accordance with and in the manner provided by
this Article II, subject to the limitations and conditions in this Article II,
and any other rights expressly provided by this Agreement. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Dissenting Shares will not
be converted as provided in the foregoing sentence and will instead be
converted into the right to receive payment of the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, except if any Stockholder that demands appraisal of such Stockholder's
Shares under the DGCL effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such Stockholder's right to appraisal, then such
Stockholder's Shares will automatically be deemed to have been canceled and
converted (without interest) as provided in the foregoing sentence as of the
Effective Time.

(d) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any Party or any Equityholder, all Shares that are owned by the
Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (if any)
will be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no
consideration will be paid or delivered in exchange therefor.

Company shall deliver to Purchaser a schedule to be attached hereto as
Schedule I (the "Allocation Schedule") setting forth the Company's good faith

Closing, (iv) Pro Rata Share, (v) portion of the Promised Option Bonus Amount,

to the Equityholders pursuant thereto. The Parties further agree that the
Representative shall update the Allocation Schedule from time to time to
reflect the allocation of any payment and to promptly furnish any such update
to Purchaser and the Paying Agent. Once the Paying Agent and, to the extent
required, the Surviving Corporation have made all payments required to be made
hereunder to the Equityholders in accordance with the Allocation Schedule,
such payments shall constitute a complete discharge of the applicable payment
obligations of Purchaser and Merger Sub hereunder to the Equityholders.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any additional
action on the part of Merger Sub or the Company: (a) the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated to

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company makes the representations and warranties to Purchaser and Merger

this Article III:

Section 3.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Each member of the Company Group
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each member of the
Company Group is duly qualified to do business and, where applicable as a
legal concept, is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties it owns, operates or
leases or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified or in good standing that would not
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company Group has made available to
Purchaser and Merger Sub complete and correct copies of the Company Group's
Governing Documents, each as amended to date, and such documents are in full
force and effect. Each member of the Company Group is in compliance with all
of the terms and provisions of its Governing Documents.

Section 3.2 Subsidiaries. The Company does not have any Subsidiaries, except
for CytoSolv, or any other direct or indirect ownership interest in any
corporation, limited liability company, joint venture, partnership, trust,
non-corporate business enterprise or other Person and does not directly or
indirectly own any capital stock in any other Person. The Company is the
record holder of beneficial ownership of all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of CytoSolv. Neither the Company nor CytoSolv has
agreed to, nor are they obligated to, directly or indirectly, make any future
investment in or capital contribution or advance to any Person.

Section 3.3 Enforceability. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except to the extent enforcement may be affected by Laws relating
to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency and creditors' rights and by the
availability of injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable
remedies (collectively, "Enforceability Exceptions"). At the Closing, the
Transaction Documents to be executed and delivered by the Company will be duly
executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the Company and will
constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in
accordance with their terms, except to the extent enforcement may be affected
by Enforceability Exceptions.

Section 3.4 Capitalization.

(a) Section 3.4(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete

constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company.



(b) The issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each member of the
Company Group has been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid
and non-assessable. Except for this Agreement, the Stockholder Agreements and

preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, subscriptions,
puts, calls, conversion rights or agreements or commitments of any character
relating to the authorized and issued, unissued or treasury shares of capital
stock of any member of the Company Group. The shares of capital stock in each
member of the Company Group have not been issued in violation of any
applicable Laws or such company's Governing Documents. No member of the
Company Group has any bonds, notes, debentures or other debt securities
outstanding that have voting rights or are exercisable or convertible into, or
exchangeable or redeemable for, or that give any Person a right to subscribe
for or acquire, capital stock or any other security of the Company Group.
Except as set forth in the Stockholder Agreements, there are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, to repurchase, redeem (or establish a sinking fund
with respect to redemption) or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock

Indebtedness of the Company Group as of the date hereof.

in the applicable plan and determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code) of a Common Share on the date of the
corporate action effectuating the grant.

(e) Except as set forth in the Stockholder Agreements, the Company Group is
not a party to any voting trusts, voting agreements, proxies, equityholder
agreements or other agreements or understandings with respect to the voting of
the capital stock or other equity interests of any member of the Company Group

Schedule, assuming the due and prompt performance by Purchaser and Merger Sub

Company and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby do not and will not (a) violate any (i) applicable material Law, (ii)
applicable material Order, (iii) applicable Company Permits or (iv) Company
Material Contract (as defined below) or (b) constitute a breach or violation
of, or a default under, the Governing Documents of the Company Group.

and binding obligations of Purchaser and Merger Sub, enforceable in accordance
with their terms, except to the extent enforcement may be affected by
Enforceability Exceptions.

Purchaser or Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, no such Proceeding

pursuant to Article II, and Purchaser's obligations hereunder are not subject
to any conditions regarding Purchaser's ability to obtain financing for the
Merger.



Section 4.6 Acquisition of Transferred Interests for Investment. Purchaser has
such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, and is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the Merger. Each of Purchaser
and Merger Sub confirms that the Company has made available to each of
Purchaser and Merger Sub and their agents the opportunity to ask questions of
the officers and management employees of the Company as well as access to the

connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present intention of
distributing or selling the Shares. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub
acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act
or any state securities Laws, and agrees that the Shares may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
without registration under the Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption
from such registration available under the Securities Act, and without
compliance with foreign securities Laws, in each case, to the extent
applicable.

of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the
Closing Date will be, owned by Purchaser and such capital stock shall be as of
the Closing free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than transfer

solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions and prior to the
Closing Date will have engaged in no other business activities and will have
incurred no liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 4.8 No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article III (including the
Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement), Purchaser and Merger Sub
acknowledge that neither the Company nor CytoSolv, nor any other Person, made
or shall be deemed to have made any representation or warranty to Purchaser or
Merger Sub, express or implied, at Law or in equity, on behalf of the Company
or CytoSolv. Any claims Purchaser or Merger Sub may have for breach of
representation or warranty shall be based solely on the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly set forth in this Agreement, the ancillary
agreements hereto and the certificates and other documents delivered pursuant
hereto and thereto.

Section 5.6 Disclosure Schedule.

(a) All representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document are made subject to and modified by the exceptions
noted in the schedules delivered by the Company to Purchaser concurrently
herewith and identified as the "Disclosure Schedule," as it may be modified
from time to time pursuant to Section 5.6(b). A disclosure made by the Company
in any Section of the Disclosure Schedule (or subparts thereof) that
reasonably informs Purchaser of information with respect to another Section of
this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the Disclosure Schedule (or
subparts thereof) in order to avoid a misrepresentation thereunder will be
deemed, for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, to have been made with respect to all such other Sections of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Disclosure Schedule (or
subparts thereof), notwithstanding any cross-references (which are included
solely as a matter of convenience) or lack of a Schedule reference in any
representation or warranty. Information reflected in the Disclosure Schedule
is not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be
reflected in the Disclosure Schedule. Such additional information is set forth
for informational purposes and does not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. Disclosure of such additional information will not be deemed
to constitute an acknowledgment that such information is required to be
disclosed, and disclosure of such information will not be deemed to enlarge or
enhance any of the representations or warranties in this Agreement or
otherwise alter in any way the terms of this Agreement. Inclusion of
information in the Disclosure Schedule will not be construed as an admission
that such information is material to the business, assets, liabilities,
financial position, operations or results of operations of any member of the
Company Group. To the extent that any representation or warranty is limited by
its terms to a specific date or range of dates, such representation and
warranty shall be deemed to have been made only on such date or during the
range of dates so specified.

(b) From time to time between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the
Company, in its sole discretion, may supplement or amend the Disclosure
Schedule and deliver such supplemented or amended Disclosure Schedule to
Purchaser solely with respect to any fact, occurrence, event, effect, change,
circumstance or development, which comes into existence, occurs or becomes
known after the date hereof,



or which, if existing, occurring or known on the date of this Agreement would
have been required to been set forth on the Disclosure Schedule. No such
supplement or amendment to the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to Section 5.6(a)
shall be deemed to have modified the representations, warranties or covenants
of the Company herein for purposes of determining whether the conditions set
forth in Section 6.2(a) have been satisfied, or shall affect whether a breach
of such representations, warranties or covenants has occurred for purposes of
determining Purchaser's rights under Article IX or Article X with respect
thereto; provided however, that, the Company shall be permitted to provide an
updated version of Section 3.4(a), Section 3.4(d)(i) and Section 3.4(d)(ii) of
the Disclosure Schedule (solely with respect to the outstanding Shares and
Options and the ownership thereof) to Purchaser one (1) Business Day prior to
the Closing Date, which such update shall be deemed to modify Section 3.4(a),
Section 3.4(d)(i) and Section 3.4(d)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule provided
as of the date hereof.

Section 5.7 Confidentiality Agreement. That certain Confidentiality Agreement,
dated May 6, 2019, between Purchaser and the Company (the "Confidentiality
Agreement") is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference and made a
part of this Agreement and will survive the execution of this Agreement
notwithstanding the terms thereof. The provisions of this Section 5.7 will
terminate upon the Closing.

Section 5.8 Transfer of Permits. If any Permit of a member of the Company
Group must be reissued to any Person on account of the Transactions in order
to operate the applicable member of the Company Group's business following the
Closing, then each of the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Permit; provided, however, that
no member of the Company Group will be required to make any payment prior to
the Closing to any third party with respect to the Company's, Purchaser's or
Merger Sub's efforts to obtain any Permit unless Purchaser agrees to pay or
reimburse the Company prior to the Closing for any such payment.

Section 5.9 Officers' and Directors' Liability; Release.

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, Purchaser will cause the Surviving Corporation (and any successor in
interest) to maintain on terms no less favorable in the aggregate than the
current terms, and to honor in accordance with such terms, the provisions of
the Governing Documents of the Company and any agreements between the Company
and each individual who, at or prior to the Closing Date, was entitled to
indemnification pursuant to the Governing Documents or any indemnification
agreements between such Person and the Company (each, a "Covered Person")
(including provisions relating to contributions and advancement of expenses,
in each case, to the extent so provided), and the provisions with respect to
indemnification and limitations on liability set forth in such Governing
Documents or indemnification agreements shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified during such period. For the avoidance of doubt, it being
the intent of the Parties that the Covered Persons will continue to be
entitled to such exculpation, indemnification, and advancement of expense to
the fullest extent of the Law, the Governing Documents and any such
indemnification agreements.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation (and any
successor in interest) to purchase, and the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Closing shall purchase and maintain in effect for a period of
six (6) years thereafter, a tail policy to the current officers' and
directors' liability insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Company, on
terms no less favorable in terms of coverage and amount in the aggregate than
the officers' and directors' liability insurance currently maintained in
effect by the Company; provided, however, that in no event shall the cost of
the entire tail policy be in excess of [*]% of the annual premium currently
paid by or on behalf of the Company for its existing policy of officers' and
directors' liability insurance as in effect on the date hereof.



(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Person entitled to indemnification or any
other benefits under this Section 5.9, and each such Person's heirs, legatees,
representatives, successors, and assigns (and the Parties expressly agree that
such Persons will be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9), (ii) will
survive the consummation of a transaction involving the merger, consolidation
or other reorganization of the Company, Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation
and continue in full force and effect and binding against the survivor of any
such transaction or successor to any of the Company, Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification that any such Person may have by
contract or otherwise.

Section 5.10 Labor Matters.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain a written waiver from each "disqualified individual" (within
the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) with respect to the Company of his
or her right to any and all payments or other benefits that could be deemed
"parachute payments" under Section 280G(b) of the Code if such payments are
not approved by the Company's stockholders in a manner that satisfies the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) and any regulations (including proposed
regulations) thereunder. After obtaining such written waivers and prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall solicit stockholder approval of any and all
such waived payments or benefits in a manner that intended to satisfy the
requirements for the exemption under Section 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code and
the regulations thereunder, including the provision of adequate disclosure to
all applicable stockholders of all material facts concerning all payments
that, in the absence of such stockholder approval, could be classified as
"parachute payments" to a "disqualified individual" under Section 280G of the
Code. The form of waiver, solicitation of approval, and disclosure materials
shall be subject to the prior review and reasonable approval of Purchaser,
which shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to review such documents
before the waivers and approval are sought. As soon as practicable (but not
more than ten (10) calendar days) following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver to Purchaser a report that sets forth the Company's good
faith estimate, as of the date of such report, of the amounts described in
this Section 5.10(a) (including reasonable documentation).

(b) If requested by Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the
Company's tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan (the "Company
401(k) Plan"), or cause such plan to be terminated, effective as of no later
than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing, and provide that participants in the Company 401(k)
Plan shall become fully vested in any unvested portion of their Company 401(k)
Plan accounts as of the date such plan is terminated. If the Company 401(k)
Plan is terminated, Purchaser shall designate a tax-qualified defined
contribution retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement that is
sponsored by Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries (the "Purchaser 401(k)
Plan") that will cover Company Employees effective as of the Closing Date. In
connection with the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, Purchaser shall
cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept from the Company 401(k) Plan the
"direct rollover" of the account balance of each Company Employee who
participated in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated
and who elects such direct rollover in accordance with the terms of the
Company 401(k) Plan and the Code.

(c) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time, Purchaser agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain the compensation levels (other than equity
incentives), including base salary and annual cash incentive opportunities, of
employees of the Company Group who remain employed after the Effective Time
(the "Continuing Employees") at levels which are, in the aggregate, comparable
to those in effect for the Continuing Employees



immediately prior to the Effective Time. Purchaser will treat, and cause the
applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of the Continuing Employees
with the applicable member of the Company Group attributable to any period
before the Effective Time as service rendered to Purchaser or any Subsidiary
of the Purchaser for purposes of eligibility and vesting under Purchaser's
vacation program, health or welfare plan(s) maintained by Purchaser, and
Purchaser's defined contribution plans, except where credit would result in
duplication of benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent that
any Continuing Employee participates in any health or other group welfare
benefit plan of Purchaser following the Effective Time, (A) Purchaser shall
cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods
or required physical examinations under any health or similar welfare plan of
Purchaser to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their
eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in
which the Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (B) any deductibles paid by Continuing Employee under the Company
Group's health plans in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs shall
be credited towards deductibles under the health plans of Purchaser or any
Subsidiary of Purchaser in which the Continuing Employee commences
participation in such plan year.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee any right
to continue in the employ or service of Purchaser or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of Purchaser, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Purchaser, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge
or terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 5.10 shall (i) be deemed or
construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan or
Purchaser employee benefit plan, or (ii) create any third party rights in any
current or former employee, director or other service provider of Purchaser,
the Company or any of their respective affiliates (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof).

(e) Neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation following the Effective
Time shall, at any time prior to 90 days after the Effective Time, take any
action that would result in a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" as those terms
are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988,
as amended ("WARN"), or comparable conduct under any applicable state Law,
affecting in whole or in part any facility, site of employment, operating unit
or employee of the Surviving Corporation without complying fully with the
requirements of WARN or such applicable state Law.

Section 5.11 Independent Investigation. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub
acknowledges and covenants and agrees: (a) that it and its representatives and
Affiliates have undertaken their own independent investigation, examination,
analysis and verification of each member of the Company Group and the
business, assets, liabilities, suppliers, officers, employees, personnel,
contracts, condition (financial and otherwise), cash flow, operations and
prospects of each member of the Company Group, including Purchaser's own
estimate of the value of the business of the Company; (b) that it has had the
opportunity to visit with the Company and meet with its representatives and
Affiliates to discuss the business and the assets, liabilities, suppliers,
officers, employees, personnel, contracts, condition (financial and
otherwise), cash flow, operations and prospects of each member of the Company
Group; and (c) that it has undertaken such due diligence (including a review
of the assets, liabilities, books, records and contracts of the Company) as
Purchaser or Merger Sub deems adequate, including that described above. In
connection with such investigation, each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and their
respective representatives and Affiliates have received from or on behalf of
the Company Group certain estimates, budgets, forecasts, plans, projections
and statements ("Forward-Looking Statements"), and each of Purchaser and
Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in making
Forward-Looking Statements; (ii) that the Company makes no representations or
warranties with respect to such Forward-Looking Statements except as set forth
in Article III; and (iii) it is familiar with such uncertainties and it is
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all



Forward-Looking Statements so furnished to it and its representatives
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying any Forward-
Looking Statements where such assumptions are explicitly disclosed). Each of
Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that any documents that are
or were available for its review in connection with its due diligence
investigation will be deemed to have been made available to, and received by,
Purchaser and Merger Sub for all purposes if such documents were posted and
made available to Purchaser and Merger Sub in the Data Room by 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on the date that is one (1) calendar day prior to the date of
this Agreement.

Section 5.12 Governmental Consents.

(a) Each of the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary
or appropriate for the purpose of consummating and effectuating the
Transactions as promptly as practicable. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Party (other than the Representative) agrees to use reasonable best efforts
to: (i) promptly (and in no event later than the date that is ten Business
Days after the date hereof) make and effect all registrations, filings and
submissions required to be made or effected by it or otherwise advisable
pursuant to the HSR Act; (ii) provide all information requested by any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions; and (iii) take,

waiting periods under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws and
obtain any clearance or approval required to be obtained from the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall require
Purchaser or its Affiliates to sell, divest, license, dispose or hold separate
any assets, business or voting securities (or proffering or agreeing to take
such actions), or take any other action that limits the freedom of action with
respect to or otherwise impairs its business activities in order to obtain any
clearance or approval required to be obtained from the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, or any other Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions.

(b) Each Party warrants that all filings made by it pursuant to the HSR Act
will be, as of the date filed, complete and accurate and in accordance with
the requirements of the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Laws. Each
of Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub agrees to make available to the other
Party's counsel such information as each of them may reasonably request, and
as may be appropriate under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust
Laws, so as to enable each Party to submit their required filings. [*]

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained elsewhere in this
Section 5.12, subject to applicable Law, each Party hereto shall: (i) give the
other Parties prompt written notice of the making or commencement of any
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions; (ii) keep the other
Parties informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other Parties of any
communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S.
Department of Justice, any foreign competition authority, or other
Governmental Authority regarding the Transactions. Each Party hereto will
consult and cooperate with the other Parties and will consider in good faith
the views of the other Parties in connection with any analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or
submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Proceeding. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Authority or by any Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Proceeding, each Party hereto will permit authorized
representatives of the other Parties to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any



document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Authority
in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding.
The Parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any
competitively sensitive information provided to the other under this Section
5.12 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained
therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by outside counsel to any employees, officers, or directors of
the recipient without the advance written consent of the disclosing Party.

(d) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial
action or Proceeding is commenced challenging the Transactions and such
litigation, action or Proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to
seek, to prevent the consummation of the Transactions, Purchaser and Merger
Sub shall take any and all action to resolve any such litigation, action or
Proceeding and each of the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall cooperate
with each other and use its respective best efforts to contest any such
litigation, action or Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Transactions, in each case subject to the last
sentence of Section 5.12(a).

Section 5.13 Required Approval.

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Law and its organizational documents to seek and obtain the Company
Stockholder Consent within 24 hours after the execution and delivery of this

inclusive of the Shares delivered pursuant to the Company Stockholder Consent
(the "Closing Threshold"), irrevocably approving the Transactions, including
the Merger, and adopting this Agreement and waiving any applicable notice
provisions or appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL, the Governing
Documents and the Stockholders Agreements (the "Consent Agreements").

constituting the Closing Threshold to Purchaser at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, (i) the holders of at least a majority of

then-outstanding shares of Common Shares (other than those issued or issuable
upon conversion of Preferred Shares) held by the Key



Holders (as defined in the Voting Agreement) shall effect the Drag-Along
Rights set forth in Section 3 of the Voting Agreement (the "Drag-Along
Right").

Section 5.14 Pre-Closing Covenants. During the Pre-Closing Period, each of the
Parties will use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions as soon as practicable.
During the Pre-Closing Period, none of the Parties will intentionally perform
any act that, if performed, or intentionally omit to perform any act that, if
omitted to be performed, would prevent or excuse the performance of this
Agreement by any Party or that would result in any representation or warranty
herein contained of such Party being untrue in any material respect as if
originally made on and as of the Closing Date.

Section 5.15 Inspection of Records. Purchaser will cause each member of the
Company Group to make its books and records (including work papers in the
possession of its accountants) available for inspection (and permit extracts
or copies thereof to be made) by Representative, or by its representatives,
for reasonable business purposes upon reasonable prior notice at all
reasonable times during normal business hours, for a [*] period from and after
the Closing Date, with respect to all transactions of any member of the
Company Group occurring prior to or relating to the Closing, and the
historical financial condition, assets, liabilities, operations and cash flows
of any member of the Company Group; provided that Purchaser and its
Representatives shall not be required to make available the books and records
to any member of the Company Group or the Representative if the
Representative, the Equityholders, or any of their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse
parties in any Proceeding to which the books and records relate.

Section 5.16 Transaction Litigation. In the event that any action or
proceeding relating to the Transactions, including the Merger, is brought or
threatened against any member of the Company Group or any of its directors or
officers, the Company shall promptly notify in writing Purchaser of such
Proceeding or threatened Proceeding and shall keep Purchaser informed on a
reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof. Subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall give Purchaser the opportunity, at
Purchaser's cost and expense, to participate in the defense or settlement of
any such Proceeding, and no such settlement in respect thereof shall be agreed
to without the prior written consent of Purchaser (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 5.17 Further Assurances. The Parties agree that in the event any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, each such Party will take such further action, will execute such
further documents, and perform such further acts, as may be necessary to

ARTICLE VIII 
REPRESENTATIVE

Section 8.1 Appointment of Representative. By voting in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement, the approval of the principal terms of the Merger, and the
consummation of the Merger or participating in the Merger and receiving the
benefits thereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable in
connection with the Merger, each Equityholder, on behalf of himself, herself
or itself and such Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns, hereby
irrevocably constitutes and appoints Representative as representative,
attorney-in-fact and agent for such Equityholder and such Equityholder's
successors and permitted assigns for all purposes in connection with the
execution and performance of this Agreement and the agreements ancillary
hereto. This power is irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and will not
be affected by the death, incapacity, illness, dissolution or other inability
to act of any Equityholder or such Equityholder's successors or permitted
assigns.

Section 8.2 Authority of Representative. Without limiting the authority
granted in Section 8.1, each Equityholder, on behalf of himself, herself or
itself and such Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns, hereby
irrevocably grants Representative full power and authority: (a) to execute and
deliver, on behalf of such Equityholder and such Equityholder's successors and
permitted assigns, and to accept delivery of, on behalf of such Equityholder
and such Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns, such documents as
may be deemed by Representative, in its sole discretion, to be appropriate to
consummate this Agreement; (b) to make decisions on behalf of Equityholders
and their respective successors and permitted assigns with



respect to the Transactions and matters contemplated under this Agreement or

on behalf of such Equityholder and such Equityholder's successors and

such Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns, any settlement
agreement, release or other document with respect to such dispute or remedy;
(d) to give or agree to, on behalf of such Equityholder and such
Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns, any and all consents,
waivers, amendments or modifications, deemed by Representative, in its sole
discretion, to be necessary or appropriate, under this Agreement, and, in each
case, to execute and deliver any documents that may be necessary or
appropriate in connection therewith; (e) to enforce, on behalf of such
Equityholder and such Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns, any
claim against Purchaser arising under this Agreement; (f) to engage attorneys,
accountants and other agents at the expense of Equityholders and their
respective successors and permitted assigns in connection with any claim
arising under this Agreement; (g) to receive the Representative Expense Amount
as a fund (the "Representative Expense Fund") for the payment of all costs and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of Representative in its capacity as such in
connection with any dispute or claim under this Agreement; provided, however,
that Representative's retention of any amounts in the Representative Expense
Fund will not be used as evidence that Equityholders have any obligation
hereunder; (h) to amend this Agreement (other than this Section 8.2) or any of
the instruments to be delivered to Purchaser by such Equityholder pursuant to
this Agreement; and (i) to give such instructions and to take such action or
refrain from taking such action, on behalf of such Equityholder and such
Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns, as Representative deems, in
its sole discretion, necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement, including the exercise of all rights granted to Equityholder
and such Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns under this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document.

Section 8.3 Reliance. Each Equityholder, on behalf of himself, herself or
itself and Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns, hereby agrees to
the following:

(a) In all matters in which action by Representative is required or permitted,
Representative is authorized to act on behalf of such Equityholder, on behalf
of himself, herself or itself and such Equityholder's successors and permitted
assigns, notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among Equityholders or
their respective successors or permitted assigns or between any Equityholder
or any Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns and Representative, and
Purchaser and Merger Sub will be entitled to rely on any and all action taken
by Representative under this Agreement without any liability to, or obligation
to inquire of, any Equityholder or any Equityholder's successors and permitted
assigns, notwithstanding any knowledge on the part of Purchaser of any such
dispute or disagreement. Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
will be fully protected in dealing with Representative under this Agreement
(or any other Transaction Document) and may rely upon the authority of
Representative to act on behalf of each Equityholder.

(b) After the Closing, notice to Representative, delivered in the manner
provided in Section 11.3, will be deemed to be notice to all Equityholders and
their respective successors and permitted assigns for purposes of this
Agreement.

(c) The power and authority of Representative, as described in this Agreement,
will continue in force until all rights and obligations of Equityholders and
their respective successors and permitted assigns under this Agreement
terminate, expire or are fully performed.



(d) A majority-in-interest of Equityholders and their respective successors
and permitted assigns will have the right, exercisable from time to time upon
written notice delivered to Representative and Purchaser, to remove
Representative, with or without cause, and to appoint an Equityholder (or, in
the case of an Equityholder that is a corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, or trust, an officer, manager, employee, or partner of such
Equityholder) to fill a vacancy caused by the death, resignation or removal of
Representative.

(e) The Representative may resign at any time. If Representative resigns or is
removed or otherwise ceases to function in his, her or its capacity as such
for any reason whatsoever, and no successor is appointed pursuant to Section
8.3 within 30 calendar days, then Purchaser will have the right to appoint an
Equityholder or a successor or permitted assign thereof to act as
Representative to serve as described in this Agreement.

Section 8.4 Actions by Equityholders. Each Equityholder, on behalf of himself,
herself or itself and such Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns,
agrees that, notwithstanding the foregoing, at the request of Purchaser, such
Equityholder and such Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns will
take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the Transactions
(including delivery of such Equityholder's Shares and acceptance of the Merger
Consideration therefor) individually on such Equityholder's own behalf and on
behalf of such Equityholder's successors and permitted assigns, and to deliver
any other documents required of Equityholders and their respective successors
and permitted assigns pursuant to the terms hereof.

Section 8.5 Indemnification of Representative. The Representative will incur
no liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the
Representative in connection with its services pursuant to this Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly
resulting from the Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Representative shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to
the advice of counsel. The Equityholders shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Representative from and against any and all Losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses")
arising out of or in connection with the Representative's execution and
performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Representative, the Representative will reimburse the Equityholders the amount
of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such
gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Representative by the Equityholders, any such Representative Losses may be
recovered by the Representative from the funds in the Representative Expense
Fund; provided, that while this Section 8.5 allows the Representative to be
paid from the aforementioned source of funds, this does not relieve the
Equityholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses
as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Equityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or indemnification
obligations of the Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not
intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Representative
under this Section 8.5. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing,
the resignation or removal of the Representative or the termination of this
Agreement.



Section 8.6 Representative Expense Fund. The Representative Expense Fund will
be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Representative
for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the agreements
ancillary hereto. The Equityholders will not receive any interest or earnings
on the Representative Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Representative will not be liable for any loss
of principal of the Representative Expense Fund other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative will hold these
funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its
operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily
make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As
soon as practicable following the completion of the Representative's
responsibilities, the Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the
Representative Expense Fund to the Paying Agent for further distribution to
the Equityholders. For tax purposes, the Representative Expense Fund will be
treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Equityholders
at the time of Closing.

ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION

respect to the termination or enforcement of this Agreement that are set forth

accordance with Section 11.3:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and the Company;

(b) by either Purchaser or the Company if the Closing has not occurred at or
before 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on [*]; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.2(b) will not be available to

has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or
prior to such date;

(c) by Purchaser in the event of any breach by the Company of the Company's
agreements, covenants, representations or warranties contained herein, in a
manner that would prevent the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set
forth in Section 6.2 and such breach has not been cured within 30 calendar
days after receipt of written notice from Purchaser setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for the breach and requesting such breach to be
cured; provided, that Purchaser shall not be entitled to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.2(c) if the failure of the Closing to be
consummated by such date is caused by Purchaser's or Merger Sub's breach of
any of its obligations under the Agreement.

(d) by the Company in the event of any breach by Purchaser or Merger Sub of
any of their respective agreements, covenants, representations or warranties
contained herein in a manner that would prevent the satisfaction of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Section 6.1 and such breach has not been
cured within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice from the Company
requesting such breach to be cured provided, that the Company shall not be
entitled to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.2(d) if the
failure of the Closing to be consummated by such date is caused by the
Company's breach of any of its obligations under the Agreement; or

(e) by Purchaser or the Company if (i) there is then in effect a final, non-
appealable Order of a court of competent jurisdiction in effect precluding
consummation of the Transactions; provided, however, that the right to

Section 9.3 Remedies Upon Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 9.2, then each of the Parties will be relieved of their
respective duties and obligations under this Agreement to the extent that such
duties and obligations would otherwise arise after the date of such
termination, except as set forth in Section 9.4, and no Party will have any
claim against any other Party, unless the circumstances giving rise to the
termination of this Agreement were caused by a Party's willful breach of a
material representation, warranty, agreement or covenant set forth in this
Agreement or Fraud, in which event termination of this Agreement will not be
deemed or construed as limiting or denying any legal or equitable right or
remedy of the non-breaching Party. If following the termination of this
Agreement any Proceeding is commenced by any Party to pursue any legal or
equitable right or remedy against any other Party whose willful breach of a
material representation, warranty, agreement or covenant herein or Fraud
results in the termination of this Agreement, then all fees, costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, incurred by
the prevailing Party in such Proceeding will be reimbursed by the losing
Party; provided that, if a Party to such Proceeding prevails in part, and
loses in part, the court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such
Proceeding will award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred
by such Party on an equitable basis.

Section 9.4 Certain Other Effects of Termination. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Purchaser as provided
in Section 9.2:

documents furnished to it by such other Party (or any Subsidiary, division,
associate or Affiliate of such other Party) in connection with the
Transactions, whether so obtained before or after the execution of this
Agreement, and any copies thereof (except for copies of documents publicly
available or that are subject to a bona fide document retention or electronic
archiving system) that may have been made, and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its representatives and any representatives of
financial institutions and investors and others to whom such documents were
furnished promptly to destroy such documents and any copies thereof any of
them may have made; and

(b) the Confidentiality Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement
and will remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

Stockholder (other than any Dissenting Stockholder), Optionholder and each
Promised Optionholder (each, an "Indemnifying Equityholder"), severally and
not jointly, based on their respective Pro Rata Share, shall indemnify and
hold Purchaser, its Affiliates, their respective successors and assigns
(including, from and after the Closing, the Company Group) and each of their
respective officers (or equivalents), directors (or equivalents), employees,
stockholders, partners, members or other equity holders, agents and
representatives (each, a "Purchaser Indemnified Party") harmless from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any such Purchaser
Indemnified Party to the extent arising from, relating to or otherwise in
connection with the following:



(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in
Article III made as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date
(in each case, as such representations and warranties are modified by the
Disclosure Schedule) or in any certificate or instrument delivered by or on
behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement;

(b) any breach or failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Company,
contained in this Agreement or any certificates delivered by or on behalf of
the Company;

(c) any claim by a Person seeking to assert or based upon: (i) any rights
under the Governing Documents of the Company Group; (ii) any issues arising
from the Allocation Schedule, any inaccuracy, error or omission therein, or
any action taken or not taken by the Representative or for any act or omission
taken or not taken by Purchaser or Merger Sub solely in reliance upon the
actions taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings made,
given or executed by the Representative in connection with the Allocation
Schedule, including any failure of the Representative to correctly calculate
the amounts owing to a Equityholder; (iii) any breach of fiduciary duty by the
Company Group's directors or officers (or equivalents) prior to the Closing;
and (iv) any Transaction Expenses of the Company Group in excess of $[*] that
were not reflected in the calculation of Merger Consideration.

Section 10.2 Indemnification by Purchaser. Subject to the other provisions of
this Article X, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
the Stockholders, the Optionholders, the Promised Optionholders, and, if
applicable, each of their respective officers (or equivalents), directors (or
equivalents), employees, stockholders, partners, members or other equity
holders, agents and representatives (each, an "Equityholder Indemnified
Party") harmless from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
any such Equityholder Indemnified Party to the extent arising from, relating
to or otherwise in connection with the following:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Purchaser or
Merger Sub set forth in Article IV made as of the date of this Agreement and
as of the Closing Date or in any certificate or instrument delivered by or on
behalf of Purchaser or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement; or

(b) any breach or failure to perform any covenant or agreement of Purchaser or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or other Transaction Document.

Section 10.3 Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein and subject to Section 11.17:

(a) Solely for purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty
has been breached and for calculating the amount of aggregate Losses
recoverable under Section 10.1(a), all representations and warranties of the
Company in Article III (other than Section 3.7) shall be construed as if all
qualifications as to materiality, including any reference to "Material Adverse
Effect" (and variations thereof), were omitted from such representations and
warranties.

(b) Except (x) with respect to claims for equitable relief pursuant to Section
11.17 or (y) in the case of Fraud, the remedies provided under this Article X
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies available with respect to claims of
an Indemnified Party (whether at law or in equity) under or arising out of
this Agreement or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether for breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or
otherwise.

(c) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties have the right to payment by the
Indemnifying Equityholders under Section 10.1(a) only if, and only to the
extent that, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties



have incurred (i) as to all matters giving rise to indemnification under
Section 10.1(a), indemnifiable Losses in excess of an amount equal to $[*]
(the "Indemnifiable Losses Deductible"), in which case the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all indemnifiable Losses in
excess of the Indemnifiable Losses Deductible from the Indemnifying
Equityholders and (ii) as to any individual item giving rise to
indemnification under Section 10.1(a), an amount equal to $[*] (the "Mini-
Basket"). However, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' right to payment by the
Indemnifying Equityholders with respect to Fraud is not subject to the
Indemnifiable Losses Deductible or the Mini-Basket.

(d) No Indemnifying Equityholder will have any liability under or in
connection with this Agreement, or the Transactions, in excess of its Pro Rata
Share of the amounts held under the Escrow Agreement, except with respect to
Losses arising from Fraud.

(e) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 10.3, no Indemnifying
Equityholder will have any liability under or in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions for any Losses to the extent arising from Fraud
committed by any other Indemnifying Equityholder in his, her or its capacity
as an Equityholder.

(f) The aggregate recovery from any Indemnifying Equityholder for Losses under
or in connection with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement will not exceed
such Indemnifying Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of the aggregate consideration
set forth in the Allocation Schedule actually received by such Indemnifying
Equityholder.



Section 10.4 Indemnification Claims.

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under Section 10.1 or 10.2 in respect of, arising out of or
involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the Third Party Claim within 20 Business Days
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided under Section 10.1 or 10.2 except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
within ten Business Days after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies
of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party
alone shall be entitled to conduct and control the defense of such Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall (i) keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the status, incurred and expected
costs and other material information (including, to the extent consistent with
any confidentiality obligations and with the preservation of all applicable
privileges, defense strategy, relevant documents and records) related to the
defense of such Third Party Claim on a reasonable basis (and as may from time
to time be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party during the pendency
of the Third Party Claim), (ii) not incur unreasonable legal or other expert
fees in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim and (iii)
consider any reasonable requests or input from the Indemnifying Party
regarding defense or settlement strategies. The Indemnified Party shall not be
entitled to be indemnified or held harmless under Section 10.1 or 10.2 for
such Third Party Claim if it shall settle such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless the Indemnified Party
has sought such consent and such consent has been unreasonably withheld or
delayed, it being agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall not unreasonably
withhold or delay such consent, and shall provide such reasonable cooperation
and participation in settlement efforts as may be requested by the Indemnified
Party.

(b) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement other than in respect of, arising out of or
involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall deliver written
notice of such claim (a "Claim Notice") with reasonable promptness to the
Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided under Section 10.1 or Section
10.2 except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced
as a result of such failure. Each Claim Notice shall contain a reasonable non-
binding estimate of the Losses against which such Indemnified Party seeks
indemnification or reimbursement, to the extent that such an estimate can be
made (the amount of such Losses, as such amount may be modified by the
Indemnified Party from time to time, the "Claimed Amount"). If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party, in writing, within
30 calendar days following its receipt of a Claim Notice that the Indemnifying
Party disputes the liability claimed by the Indemnified Party under Section
10.1 or Section 10.2, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such
notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability for which the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification under Section 10.1 or Section 10.2 and
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the Claimed Amount stated
in such Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed the
liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute.

Section 10.5 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each
Party's representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing. Each Party's representations and warranties shall expire
on the date that is [*] from the Closing Date. If an Indemnified Party
delivers, before expiration of a representation, warranty or covenant, written
notice in accordance with Section 10.4, then the applicable representation,
warranty or covenant shall survive until, but only for



purposes of, the resolution of any claims arising from or related to the
matter covered by such notice. The rights to indemnification set forth in this
Article X shall not be affected by any investigation conducted by or on behalf
of the Indemnified Party or any knowledge acquired by the Indemnified Party,
whether before or after the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with
respect to the inaccuracy or non-compliance with any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation which is the subject of indemnification hereunder.
Nothing in this Section 10.5 shall be construed to limit the survival of
covenants, agreements and obligations that by their terms are to be performed
or observed after the Closing or for which another time period is specified in
this Agreement. It is the express intent of the Parties hereto that, if the
applicable survival period for an item as contemplated by this Section 10.5 is
shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been
applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened
survival period contemplated hereby. The Parties hereto further acknowledge
that the time periods set forth in this Section 10.5 for the assertion of
claims under this Agreement are the result of arm's-length negotiation between
the Parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed
by the Parties.

Section 10.6 Manner of Payment; Release of Escrow.

(a) Subject to Section 10.3(d), any indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Equityholders to any Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to
this Article X shall be satisfied by release of funds to the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement,
which release shall accordingly reduce the Escrow Fund.

(b) A Purchaser Indemnified Party claiming against the Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 10.6(a) shall, concurrently with the delivery of the
Claim Notice called for by Section 10.4(b), deliver a copy of such Claim
Notice to the Escrow Agent, and the Representative, if the Representative is
disputing the liability claimed by the Purchaser Indemnified Party, shall
concurrently with the delivery of notice of such dispute to Purchaser pursuant
to Section 10.4(b), deliver a copy of such notice to the Escrow Agent. If the
Representative fails to dispute the Claimed Amount and such claim is
conclusively deemed a liability for which the Purchaser Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification in accordance with Section 10.4(b), then the
Escrow Agent shall be permitted to disburse the Claimed Amount to the
Purchaser Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement. If the Representative disputes the Claimed Amount and
thereafter the Representative and the Purchaser Indemnified Party resolve such
dispute, joint written instructions setting forth such resolution shall be
furnished by the Representative and Purchaser to the Escrow Agent.

(c) Within two (2) Business Days after the date that is [*] after the Closing
Date (the "Escrow Release Date"), if the amount of the Escrow Amount remaining
in the Escrow Fund on the Escrow Release Date exceeds the sum of the Claimed
Amounts associated with all bona fide claims for indemnification or
reimbursement made by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties against the Escrow
Fund that have been properly asserted, have not been finally resolved and/or
paid, in each case, prior to the Escrow Release Date (each, an "Unresolved
Escrow Claim"), Purchaser and Representative shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Paying Agent from the
Escrow Fund the amount by which the remaining Escrow Amount on the Escrow
Release Date exceeds the sum of such Claimed Amounts for further payment to
the Equityholders in accordance with the Allocation Schedule.

(d) Following the Escrow Release Date, if an Unresolved Escrow Claim is
finally resolved, within two (2) Business Days after the final resolution of
such Unresolved Escrow Claim, Purchaser and Representative shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to (i)
disburse to any Purchaser Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund all amounts
payable to such



Purchaser Indemnified Party (if any) in respect of such Unresolved Escrow
Claim and (ii) disburse to the Paying Agent from the Escrow Fund an amount
equal to the amount by which the Claimed Amount of such Unresolved Escrow
Claim exceeds the disbursement referred to in clause (i), for further payment
to the Equityholders in accordance with the Allocation Schedule.

(e) As promptly as practicable after the Escrow Agent's disbursement to Paying
Agent of any amounts from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section 10.6,
Paying Agent will deliver to each Equityholder an amount equal to such
Equityholder's Pro Rata Share of such dispersed amounts from the Escrow Fund
attributable to such Equityholder's Shares; provided that any portion of such
dispersed Escrow Fund that is for payment to Vested Optionholders, Accelerated
Optionholders or Promised Optionholders (in each case, other than with respect
to No-Withholding Options) shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation for
payment in accordance with Section 10.6(f).

(f) On or before the first regularly scheduled payroll period that is at least
two (2) Business Days following receipt of any dispersed amounts from the
Escrow Fund from the Paying Agent on behalf of the former Vested
Optionholders, Accelerated Optionholders and Promised Optionholders, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay and deliver to each former holder of Vested
Options, Accelerated Options and Promised Options (other than with respect to
No-Withholding Options) an amount equal to such Equityholder's Pro Rata Share
of such dispersed Escrow Fund attributable to the Vested Options, Accelerated
Options and Promised Options, in each case, net of applicable withholding.

Section 10.7 No Duplication.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, Losses shall be calculated after giving
effect to any amounts actually recovered from third parties, including amounts
recovered under insurance policies (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any
self-insurance program or similar arrangement) with respect to such Losses,
and the net of any costs to recover such amounts; provided, however, that no
Indemnified Party shall have any affirmative obligation to pursue any such
claim against any third party or to pursue recovery under any policy of
insurance.

(b) Any Losses for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined
without duplication of recovery due to the facts giving rise to such Losses
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. In the event a Purchaser Indemnified Party actually recovers Losses
pursuant to this Article X, no other Purchaser Indemnified Party may recover
the same Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement

(c) Upon becoming aware of an event that could reasonably give rise to any
indemnifiable Losses, each Purchaser Indemnified Party agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any such Losses for which such
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article X in accordance with applicable Law.

ARTICLE XI 
MISCELLANEOUS

Section 11.1 Transaction Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein and
whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each Party shall be solely
responsible for and shall bear all of its own costs and expenses incident to
its obligations under and in respect of this Agreement and the Transactions,
including any such costs and expenses incurred by any Party in connection with
the negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the terms
of this Agreement (including the fees and expenses of legal counsel,
accountants, investment bankers or other representatives and consultants);
[*].



Section 11.2 Publicity. At any time prior to the Closing, except as otherwise
required by Law or applicable securities exchange rules, press releases and
other public announcements concerning the Transactions will be made only with
the prior agreement of the Company and Purchaser (and in any event, the
Parties will use all reasonable efforts to consult and agree with each other
with respect to the content of any such required press release or other
publicity prior to the Closing); provided, however, that the Company and
Purchaser agree to publish the joint press release in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit I promptly following the execution hereof and agree that each Party
shall be permitted to continue to use such joint press release, including the
specific content contained therein, without the need to obtain the prior

the contrary contained herein, nothing shall prevent a Stockholder that is a
venture capital or private equity fund (or its representatives), from

Fund or the Representative Expense Fund, but only to the extent (a) such

returns on investment, (ii) are permitted under the terms of such
Stockholder's governing fund documents in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and (iii) are made in connection with such Stockholder's or its

Section 11.4 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement, the Disclosure
Schedule and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among or between any of the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof. Each exhibit and schedule to this Agreement
will be considered incorporated into this Agreement. Any amendments, or
alternative or supplementary provisions, to this Agreement must be made in
writing and duly executed by (a) Purchaser and (b) (i) the Company (if prior
to the Closing) or (ii) the Representative (if after the Closing).

Section 11.5 Non-Waiver. The failure in any one or more instances of a Party
to insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege in this Agreement
conferred, or the waiver by such Party of any breach of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Agreement, will not be construed as a
subsequent waiver of any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or
privileges, but the same will continue and remain in full force and effect as
if no such forbearance or waiver had occurred. No waiver will be effective
unless it is in writing and signed by Purchaser and the Company (if prior to
the Closing) or the Representative (if after the Closing).

Section 11.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
each Party in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered will be deemed an original and all of which taken together will
constitute one and the same Agreement.

Section 11.7 Delivery by Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any other
Transaction Document, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a .PDF or other electronic transmission, will
be treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and will be
considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any Party or any
party to any such contract, each other Party or party thereto will re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other Parties or parties
thereto. No Party or any party to any such contract will raise the use of a
.PDF or other electronic transmission to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
.PDF or other electronic transmission as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense.

Section 11.8 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other provision or any other jurisdiction, and, for purposes of such
jurisdiction, such provision or portion thereof will be struck from the
remainder of this Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect. This
Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction so as
to best give effect to the intent of the Parties under this Agreement.

Section 11.9 Applicable Law. This Agreement and any controversy related to or
arising, directly or indirectly, out of, caused by or resulting from this
Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic
Laws of the State of Delaware (including with respect to the applicable
statute of limitations), without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
law provision or rule (whether of the State



of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 11.10 Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is solely for the
benefit of the Parties, and, except as set forth herein, no provision of this
Agreement will be deemed to confer any remedy, claim or right upon any third
party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties expressly
confirm their agreement that the Covered Persons and the Indemnified Parties
will also enjoy the benefits of indemnities made herein, and in the case of
the Covered Persons, the benefits of Section 5.9, which, in each case, are
expressly stated to be in their favor. In this regard, the Parties agree that
such Persons will have the right to enforce those provisions directly against
the applicable Party that has agreed to provide such indemnities. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Leadership Members (as defined
in Schedule V hereto) will enjoy the benefits of Section 2.6(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule, which, in each case, are expressly stated to be in their
favor. In this regard, the Parties agree that such Persons will have the right
to enforce those provisions of Section 2.6(b) of the Disclosure Schedule
against the Purchaser directly.

Section 11.11 Binding Effect; Benefit. This Agreement will inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the Parties, and their successors and permitted
assigns.

Section 11.12 Assignment. This Agreement and each of the respective rights and
obligations of the Parties hereto may not be assigned by Purchaser, Merger Sub
or the Company without the prior written consent of the other Parties;
provided, Purchaser may, with the prior written consent of any other Party,
assigns the Agreement and any of its rights, interests or obligations
hereunder to any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries, but no such assignment
shall relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 11.13 Waiver of Trial by Jury. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
waives the right to a jury trial in connection with any Proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (including any Proceeding
seeking enforcement of such Party's rights under this Agreement).

Section 11.14 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees
that any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions brought by any Party or its Affiliates against any other Party or
its Affiliates will be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware; provided that if jurisdiction is not then available in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any such Proceeding may be
brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other
Delaware state court. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the
Parties agrees not to commence any Proceeding relating thereto except in the
courts described above in Delaware, other than Proceedings in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce any Order rendered by any such court in
Delaware as described herein. Each of the Parties further agrees that notice
as provided herein will constitute sufficient service of process and the
Parties further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
(a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the Proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such
Proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts.



Section 11.15 Governmental Reporting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will be construed to mean that a
Party or other Person must make or file, or cooperate in the making or filing
of, any return or report to any Governmental Authority in any manner that such
Person or such Party reasonably believes or reasonably is advised is not in
accordance with Law.

Section 11.16 Limitation on Warranties. Except for and without limiting the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, are qualified by any related item in the Disclosure
Schedule) the Company is not making and will not be deemed to have made, and
neither the Company nor any Equityholder (or any other Person) will have or be
subject to any liability arising out of, or relating to or resulting from, any
other representations and warranties, written or oral, common law or
statutory, express or implied (including with respect to non-infringement,
merchantability or suitability or fitness for a particular purpose), as to the
accuracy or completeness of, or the distribution to, or use by Purchaser or
Merger Sub, of any advice, document, or other information regarding the
Shares, the Company or the business, financial condition and assets (including
the condition, value, quality or suitability of any assets) or liabilities of
the Company, including Forward-Looking Statements (any of the foregoing, an
"Extra-Contractual Statement"). Purchaser represents, warrants and
acknowledges that, except as expressly provided in Article III, none of any
Equityholder, the Company, or Representative have made, and each Equityholder,
the Company, and Representative hereby expressly disclaim and negate, and each
of Purchaser and its Affiliates hereby expressly waives and is not relying on
any Extra-Contractual Statement (including any express or implied warranty
relating to the Shares or any assets (tangible, intangible or mixed) of the
Company, including implied warranties of fitness, non-infringement,
merchantability or suitability or fitness for a particular purpose), and each
of Purchaser and its Affiliates hereby expressly waives and relinquishes any
and all rights, claims and causes of action in connection with, the accuracy
completeness or materiality of any Extra-Contractual Statement heretofore
furnished or made available to Purchaser or its representatives or Affiliates
by or on behalf of any Equityholder or the Company (it being intended that no
such prior Extra-Contractual Statement will survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement).

Section 11.17 Specific Performance.

(a) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages
or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such harm. The
Parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 9.2 and any dispute over the right to termination has
been finally resolved, (i) the Parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth
in Section 11.14 to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than
Purchaser's and Merger Sub's obligation to effect the Closing, which shall be
governed by the next sentence), without bond or other security being required,
and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions, including the Merger, and without that right, none of the
Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. The
Parties hereto further agree that unless and until this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 9.2 and any dispute over the right to
termination has been finally resolved, the Company shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy to specifically
enforce Purchaser's and Merger Sub's obligations to effect the Closing on the
terms and conditions set forth herein in the event that the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided that each such
condition is then capable of being satisfied at a Closing on such date, other
than solely by virtue of Purchaser's failure to effect the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived (the "Specific Performance Conditions"). Each of the
Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other of
such Party has an adequate remedy at



law or that any such injunction or award of specific performance or other
equitable relief is not an appropriate remedy for any reason; provided that
solely with respect to the equitable remedy to specifically enforce
Purchaser's or Merger Sub's obligation to effect the Closing, Purchaser and
Merger Sub may oppose the granting of specific performance only on the basis
that one of the Specific Performance Conditions has not been satisfied. The
Parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this Section 11.17, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement
(including monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this
Agreement or in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the
event that the remedies provided for in this Section 11.17 are not available
or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this Section 11.17
shall require any Party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or limit any
Party's right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this
Section 11.17 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under Article IX (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.17 or anything set
forth in this Section 11.17 restrict or limit any Party's right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article IX or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time. In any
Proceeding seeking monetary damages against a Party or to compel a Party to
specifically perform its obligations hereunder, the substantially non-
prevailing Party in such Proceeding (after a final, non-appealable judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction) shall promptly reimburse the substantially
prevailing Party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements) in connection with such Proceeding.

Section 11.18 Legal Representation.

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees, and
Affiliates that Goodwin Procter LLP currently serves as counsel to the
Company, the Representative, certain Equityholders and their respective
Affiliates (individually and collectively, "Seller Group"), in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents, the consummation of the Transactions or in
connection with any claims for indemnification against the Equityholders.
There may come a time, including after consummation of the Transactions, when
the interests of Seller Group or Representative, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, may no longer be aligned or when, for any reason,
Seller Group, Representative, Goodwin Procter LLP, or the Company believes
that Goodwin Procter LLP can or should no longer represent each of Seller
Group or Representative, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand.
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, and the Company hereby agree that
Goodwin Procter LLP (or any successor) may represent the Seller Group or
Representative in the future in connection with issues that may arise under
this Agreement and any claims that may be made pursuant to this Agreement,
including a dispute that arises after the Closing between Purchaser (and/or
the Company) and Representative, even though the interests of the
Representative may be directly adverse to Purchaser or the Company, and even
though Goodwin Procter LLP may have represented the Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute or may be handling ongoing matters for
the Company. Goodwin Procter LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to
all or a portion of the Seller Group or any director, member, partner,
officer, employee, representative, or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, or the Transactions. Each of the Parties hereto consents
thereto, and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each such
Party shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation. Each of the Parties hereto
acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been
carefully considered, and that the Parties have consulted with counsel or have
been advised they should do so in this connection.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties
intend that all communications at or prior to the Closing between the Company,
any member of the Seller Group, or



any of them (collectively, the "Target Group"), on the one hand, and any of
their attorneys, on the other hand, to the extent relating to the negotiation
of the Transactions and any alternative transactions (collectively, the
"Protected Communication"), and all associated rights to assert, waive and
otherwise administer the attorney-client privilege and right of
confidentiality of any member of the Target Group (the "Associated Rights"),
will, from and after the Closing, rest exclusively with Representative and
will not be transferred, assigned, conveyed or delivered, by operation of law
or otherwise, to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any successor or assign
of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Purchaser Group"). Accordingly,
the Parties hereby agree that, as of immediately prior to the Closing, for the
consideration set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged: (i) all
Protected Communication and Associated Rights are, and will be deemed for all
purposes, transferred, assigned, conveyed and delivered in full to
Representative, and (ii) no member of the Purchaser Group will have any right,
title, interest or benefit in or to any of the Protected Communication or any
Associated Rights. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge the
decision of the Delaware Chancery Court in Great Hill Equity Partners IV, LP,
et al. v. SIG Growth Equity Fund, I, LLP, et al. (Civil Action No. 7905-CS,
November 15, 2013) and desire to expressly exclude the Protected Communication
and Associated Rights from the assets, rights, privileges and benefits of the
Target Group that might otherwise be transferred or assigned to any member of
the Purchaser Group by operation of law or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries and a third party (other
than a Party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation (including on behalf of its
Subsidiaries) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications by Goodwin Procter LLP to such third party;
provided that neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Subsidiaries
may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Representative or the Stockholders, as applicable.

(c) Purchaser hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the other
members of the Purchaser Group, from and after the Closing, that
Representative, at the sole cost and expense of the Equityholders (i) will
have the right to take possession and control of all Protected Communication
effective as of the Closing and (ii) if and to the extent Representative fails
to take such possession and control (which failure will not, alone or in
association with any other act or omission, be deemed a waiver of any of their
rights under this Section 11.18), Representative will have the right to access
and copy, from time to time, any Protected Communication in the possession or
control of any member of the Purchaser Group from and after the Closing,
during normal business hours and on not less than 24 hours prior written
notice, as Representative (as applicable) determines, in its reasonable
discretion, may be necessary or desirable in connection with any post-Closing
matter, whether or not such matter is known to any member of the Purchaser
Group. If and to the extent that, at any time from and after the Closing, any
member of the Purchaser Group will have any right or opportunity to assert or
waive an attorney-client privilege or right of confidentiality with respect to
any Protected Communication, each member of the Purchaser Group will not, and
will cause the other members of the Purchaser Group not to, waive such
privilege or right of confidentiality without the prior written consent of
Representative (which consent may be withheld, conditioned or delayed in its
sole discretion).

JOINT PRESS RELEASE







Vertex to Acquire Semma Therapeutics With a Goal of Developing Curative Cell-
Based Treatments for Type 1 Diabetes



-Semma's unique investigational approach combines robust production process of pancreatic islet cells with proprietary delivery system to restore insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes patients-



-Semma to be acquired for $950 million in cash-



BOSTON and CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 3, 2019-- Vertex
Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ: VRTX) today announced that the company
has entered into a definitive agreement under which Vertex will acquire Semma
Therapeutics, a privately held biotechnology company pioneering the use of
stem cell-derived human islets as a potentially curative treatment for type 1
diabetes, for $950 million in cash. Semma has demonstrated a differentiated
approach to treat type 1 diabetes, a serious disease affecting over one
million people in the United States alone. Semma has made two major scientific
advances: the ability to produce large quantities of functional human
pancreatic beta cells that restore insulin secretion and ameliorate
hypoglycemia in animal models and a novel device that encapsulates and
protects these cells from the immune system, enabling durable implantation
without the need for ongoing immunosuppressive therapy.



This press release features multimedia. View the full release here:
https://www.businesswire.com/news home/20190903005227/en/



"This acquisition aligns perfectly with our strategy of investing in
scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with
serious diseases in specialty markets," said Jeffrey Leiden, M.D., Ph.D.,
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vertex. "We are excited to
work with the talented scientists at Semma to build on their significant
progress toward providing effective and potentially curative cell therapy
options for people living with type 1 diabetes. We see a substantial
opportunity to transform the treatment paradigm for type 1 diabetes, a
specialty disease cared for by endocrinologists, both by advancing the
development and manufacturing of the cells themselves, as well as through the
highly innovative cell/device combination."



"The therapeutic approach pioneered by Semma has the potential to address the
causal human biology of type 1 diabetes, a serious disease inadequately
controlled by existing therapies. Unlike insulin injections and insulin pumps,
islet cell transplantation can provide physiologic regulation of blood glucose
thereby potentially ameliorating or preventing both the hyperglycemic and
hypoglycemic episodes associated with the current standards of care," said
David Altshuler, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Global Research and
Chief Scientific Officer of Vertex. "Their compelling proof-of-concept data in
animals demonstrates the opportunity to develop transformative and potentially
curative therapies to treat people with type 1 diabetes. In addition, the
acquisition of Semma continues to expand the Vertex toolbox of cutting edge
technologies and capabilities, and bolsters our team of leading scientists."









"Type 1 diabetes is a disease that afflicts millions of people worldwide and
has no curative therapies available," said Bastiano Sanna, Ph.D., President
and Chief Executive Officer of Semma. "Vertex has a proven track record of
serial innovation and a deep commitment to developing transformative therapies
for patients in need. Being a part of Vertex will allow the Semma team to
rapidly and effectively advance our cell therapy and delivery approaches to
patients who need them."



"Semma was founded to dramatically improve the lives of patients with type 1
diabetes," said Douglas Melton, Ph.D., Scientific Founder of Semma. "Vertex is
ideally suited to accelerate the achievement of this goal."



About Semma Therapeutics



Semma was founded by Douglas Melton, Ph.D. and others to develop
transformative therapies for patients who currently depend on insulin
injections. The company is focused on advancing Dr. Melton's method of
generating billions of functional, insulin-producing beta cells grown from
stem cells in the laboratory, which develop in islet-like clusters. Initial
preclinical work in animal models of diabetes has shown that transplantation
of these cells by infusion into the liver is sufficient to control blood
glucose levels. This breakthrough technology has been exclusively licensed to
Semma for the development of a cell-based therapy for diabetes.



In addition to pursing direct intra-hepatic transplantation of these islet
cells, ongoing research at Semma is focused on combining these proprietary
cells with a state-of-the-art cell device and immune protection strategy that
can protect these cells from the patient's immune system and allow the beta
cells to function as they do in non-diabetic individuals. Implantation of the
islet cell-filled device has the potential to replace the missing beta cells
in a diabetic patient without requiring patient immunosuppression. Semma is
working to bring this new therapeutic option to the clinic and improve the
lives of patients with diabetes.



Semma recently announced the achievement of preclinical proof-of-concept for
these two lead programs based on data in which they tested human stem cell-
derived islets (SC-islets) in both non-human primates and pigs. These data
were presented in a plenary session at the International Society for Stem Cell
Research (ISSCR) in June 2019. To date, Semma's cell therapy approach is the
only islet cell transplantation program to have demonstrated both positive
c-peptide release (a marker of insulin secretion), as well as positive
glycemic control of experimentally induced diabetes.



Transaction Terms



Under the terms of the acquisition, Vertex will acquire all outstanding shares
of Semma for $950 million in cash, and Semma will become a separate operating
subsidiary of Vertex. Dr. Sanna will join Vertex as President of Semma. Also,
Dr. Melton will continue in his role as Chair of Semma's Scientific Advisory
Board and provide oversight and guidance on the research and development of
the programs.









The companies anticipate the acquisition will close in the fourth quarter of
2019, subject to certain conditions, including the expiration of the waiting
period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other
customary conditions. Vertex will provide any appropriate updates to its
current 2019 financial guidance in conjunction with its third quarter 2019
earnings release or upon closing the transaction, whichever occurs later.
