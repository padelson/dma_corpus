lesser of: (i) the amount paid to it by  the  Buyer pursuant to the Buyer
Warranty Claim; and (ii) the amount recovered from  the third party in each
case less all costs, charges and expenses reasonably  incurred by Kerr McGee
in obtaining (or consequent upon obtaining) that payment  and in recovering

received or that would have been payable but for the use of set  off  of any
relief.

 

 

6.4 The  Buyer shall notify Kerr-McGee in writing of any circumstances, facts
or matters  which following execution of this Agreement become known to it

---|--- 
    

       (c)   |  

subject  to the Buyer or the relevant member of the Buyer Group being
indemnified  by Kerr-McGee against all reasonable out of pocket costs and
expenses  properly incurred in respect of that third party  claim:

take,  and procure that each member of the Buyer Group shall take, such
action  as  Kerr-McGee may reasonably request to avoid, resist, dispute,
appeal,  compromise or defend such third party  claim;

    
---|--- 
    

       (ii)   |  

allow,  or, as appropriate, procure that the relevant member of the Buyer
Group  shall allow, Kerr-McGee to take over the conduct of all proceedings

third  party claim in question; and

    
---|--- 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

14

provide,  or procure that the relevant member of the Buyer Group shall

require in  connection with the preparation for and conduct of any
proceedings  and/or  negotiations relating to that third party  claim.

    
---|--- 
    

 

7.2 Without  prejudice to clause 7.1,  the Parties will use their reasonable
best efforts to minimise Losses and  Expenses from third party claims and
will act in good faith in responding to,  defending against, settling or
otherwise dealing with such claims.

 

 

7.3 Failure  of the Buyer to give notice in accordance with clause 7.1(a) 
shall not relieve Kerr-McGee of any of its obligations relating to Claims
under  this Agreement, except if and to the extent that Kerr-McGee is
actually  prejudiced thereby (except that Kerr-McGee shall not be liable for
any expenses  incurred during the period prior to the Buyer giving such
notice).

 

 

7.4 Whether  or not Kerr-McGee has assumed the conduct of proceedings or
negotiations (in  accordance with clause 7.1(c)(ii)  above),  Kerr-McGee
shall not be liable under any Claim for any admission of liability, 
agreement or compromise that was consented to without Kerr-McGee's prior
written  approval which relates to such Claim unless such approval has been
unreasonably  withheld or delayed.

 

 

7.5 If  the Buyer makes a Claim or notifies Kerr-McGee of any third party
claim which  might lead to such a claim being made, the Buyer shall at the
Buyer's cost make  available to accountants and other representatives

as Kerr-McGee reasonably requests  in connection with such Claim or third

15  

 

 

 

 

 

(together,  the **_Adjustments _** (with  Adjustment meaning any or all of
the above (as the context may require)), or  are  payable by the Buyer to
Kerr-McGee or by Kerr-McGee to the Buyer pursuant to  this clause 8,  clause
10,  Schedule 5  or Schedule 8  (together the **_Adjustment  Clauses_**
)  or pursuant to a Kerr-McGee Warranty Claim under clause 5  or a Buyer
Warranty Claim under clause 6 or a payment under  clause 12.4,  the same
shall operate by way of increases or decreases, as the case may be,  in  the
Base Consideration.

 

 

8.2 The  following principles shall apply in respect of the Adjustments and
the Base  Consideration:

 

       (a)   |  

the  Base Consideration shall be adjusted by the  Adjustments;

    
---|--- 
    

       (b)   |  

no  item taken into account in calculating any one Adjustment or other 
increases or decreases as the case may be under the Adjustment Clauses  or 
clause 5  or 6  or 12.4  shall be taken into account in calculating any of
the other Adjustments  so  as to result in a Party making or receiving
payment twice in respect  thereof nor will any Party be entitled under clause
12  to reimbursement of any payment received from a third party to the 
extent  such payment has been taken into account (to the benefit of that
Party)  in  calculating any of the Adjustments;

    
---|--- 
    

       (c)   |  

no  adjustment to the Base Consideration shall be made in respect of any 
matters to which clauses 12.6  and 12.8  apply.

    
---|--- 
    

       8.3   |  

(a)Kerr-McGee  shall provide the Buyer with a written statement specifying
its best  estimate of the sum of all the Adjustments as at the Completion
Date  (the  **_Interim  Net Adjustment Amount_** )  which if positive
shall increase the Base Consideration payable by  the  Buyer at Completion
and if negative shall reduce the Base Consideration  payable by the Buyer at
Completion.

    
---|--- 
    

       (b)   |  

Such  statement (the **_Interim  Completion Statement_** )  shall be
provided no later than two (2) Business Days prior to Completion,  in the
format set out in Schedule 5.

    
---|--- 
    

 

8.4 Within  sixty (60) days after Completion, and without prejudice to the
provisions of  clause 12,  Kerr-McGee shall provide the Buyer with a written
statement (in the format  set  out in Schedule 5)  giving its calculation
of the final amounts of each of:

 

       (a)   |  

the  Adjustments save in relation to the Taxation Adjustment for which a 
reasonable estimate shall be calculated;

    
---|--- 
    

       (b)   |  

the  Net Adjustment Amount; and

    
---|--- 
    

       (c)   |  

the  balance payable by Kerr-McGee or the Buyer after taking into account 
the  Interim Net Adjustment Amount which adjusted the Base Consideration 
paid  at Completion,

    
---|--- 
    

 

(the  **_Final  Completion Statement_** ).  The Buyer shall notify Kerr-
McGee in writing (such notification being an  ** _Objection  Notice_** ) 
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt whether or not it accepts
that  the Final Completion Statement has been prepared in accordance with the
relevant  provisions of this Agreement. Any notice indicating that the Buyer
does not  so  accept the Final Completion Statement shall to the extent
practicable and  reasonable:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

       (a)   |  

set  out in detail the Buyer's reasons for such non-acceptance;  and

    
---|--- 
    

       (b)   |  

specify  the adjustments which, in the Buyer's opinion, should be made to the
Final  Completion Statement in order to comply with the provisions of this 
Agreement; and

    
---|--- 
    

       (c)   |  

set  out the specific items that are in dispute accompanied by the Buyer's 
calculation at its best estimate of each of the items that are in dispute 
(the **_Disputed  Amounts_** ).

    
---|--- 
    

 

Except  for Disputed Amounts, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the
Final  Completion Statement in full.

 

 

8.5 If  the Buyer serves an Objection Notice in accordance with clause 8.4 
above,  then the Buyer and Kerr-McGee shall use all reasonable endeavours:
(a) to meet  and discuss the objections of the Buyer; and (b) to reach
agreement upon the  adjustments (if any) required to be made to the Final
Completion Statement,  within a period of ten (10) Business Days after
receipt by Kerr-McGee of the  Objection Notice. During such ten (10) Business
Days period Kerr-McGee and  its  representatives shall be permitted to
review the working papers of the Buyer  and  its representatives relating to
the Objection Notice and the basis  therefor.

 

 

8.6 If  the Buyer notifies Kerr-McGee in writing that it is satisfied with
the Final  Completion Statement (either as originally submitted or after
adjustments agreed  between Kerr-McGee and the Buyer pursuant to clause
8.5)  or if the Buyer fails to give an Objection Notice within the fifteen
(15)  Business Days period referred to in clause 8.4,  then the payment of
the Net Adjustment Amount (after taking into account the  Interim Net
Adjustment Amount which adjusted the Base Consideration paid at  Completion)
due in accordance with the Final Completion Statement shall be  made  within
three (3) Business Days of such written notification or such failure  to 
give an Objection Notice (as the case may be), together with simple interest 
on  such amount from and including the Completion Date up to and excluding
the  date  of payment calculated on a daily basis on the basis of a 360 day
year at the  rate of 2% per annum above the Reference Interest Rate.

 

 

8.7 If  the Parties cannot reach agreement as specified in clause 8.6 
within the time limit provided in that clause, the Disputed Amounts may be 
referred by any Party for determination by an independent chartered
accountant  nominated by the Parties or, in the absence of agreement between
the Parties  within five (5) Business Days of a Party notifying the other
that it proposes  to  refer the dispute to an expert, by the President of
the Institute of Chartered  Accountants in England and Wales (the
**_Nominated  Independent Accountant_** ).  The Parties shall instruct the
Nominated Independent Accountant to render its  decision within sixty (60)
days of its selection. The Nominated Independent  Accountant shall be
afforded such access to books, records, accounts and  documents in the
possession of the Parties as he may reasonably request, and  he  shall act
as expert not as arbitrator. The said accountant's determination  shall, in
the absence of fraud or manifest error, be final and binding on the  Parties,
his fees and disbursements shall be borne by Kerr-McGee as to one  half  and
the Buyer as to the other half and each party shall bear its own costs  in 
respect of such references. Payment of the Net Adjustment Amount (after
taking  into account the Interim Net Adjustment Amount which adjusted the
Base  Consideration paid at Completion) in accordance with the Nominated
Independent  Accountant's determination of the Disputed Amounts and in
accordance with the  Final Completion Statement in respect of all other items
shall be made within  three (3) Business Days of the determination of the
Nominated Independent  Accountant, together with simple interest on such
amount from and including  the  Completion Date up to and excluding the date
of payment calculated on a daily  basis on the basis of a 360 day year at the
rate of 2% per annum above the  Reference Interest Rate.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

8.8 Kerr-McGee  shall provide the Buyer with copies of all Operator's
reports, billing  statements and correspondence and any and all other
relevant documentation  in  its possession or under its control reasonably
necessary to support the  statements referred to in clauses 8.3  and 8.4 
simultaneously with the provision of such statements. The Parties shall
liaise  on the compilation and agreement of the said statements.

 

 

8.9 To  enable Kerr-McGee to meet its obligations under this clause 8,  the
Buyer shall provide to Kerr-McGee and to Kerr-McGee's accountants full 
access to the books and records, employees and premises of the Buyer. The
Buyer  shall fully co-operate with Kerr-McGee and shall permit Kerr-McGee
and  Kerr-McGee's accountants to take copies (including electronic copies) of
the  relevant books and records and shall provide all assistance reasonably
requested  by Kerr-McGee to facilitate the preparation of the Final
Completion Statement.  The Buyer hereby agrees not to take any action which
would impede or delay  the  preparation of the Final Completion Statement or
the determination of the Total  Consideration in the manner and using the
methods required by this Agreement.  The provisions of this clause 8.9 
shall apply mutatis mutandis to Kerr-McGee in relation to the obligations of 
the  Buyer under this clause 8.

 

 

8.10 All  of the calculations to be made pursuant to this clause 8  shall be
made on an Accrual Basis of Accounting and in accordance with  accounting
principles generally accepted in the oil and gas industry in the  United
Kingdom at the date of Completion unless otherwise stated in this  Agreement
and such principles shall be consistently applied for the purposes  of  any
and all disputes between the Parties.

 

 

8.11 Notwithstanding  any contrary provision in this Agreement the Parties
agree to cooperate in  order  to re-calculate the estimated Taxation
Adjustment (referred to in  clause 8.4)  prior to 30 June 2006 in accordance
with the provisions of Schedule 8;  provided that this re-calculation shall
not have any impact on the Final  Completion Statement or the Total
Consideration and the provisions of  clause 8.7  shall apply mutatis
mutandis in the event of failure to agree such Taxation  Adjustment by 30
June 2006.

 

 

8.12 In  the event of late payment, clause 13  will apply.

9.1 Each  of Kerr-McGee and the Buyer shall provide (and upon reasonable
request procure  that its respective Affiliates provide) the other with
reasonable access to  (and  the right, at the cost of the Party making the
request, to take copies of)  the  books, accounts and all other records held
by any member of the Buyer Group  or  the Kerr-McGee Group respectively
after Completion to the extent that such  books, accounts and records relate
to the Assets and to the period up to  Completion (the **_Records_** ). 
This obligation is subject to:

 

       (a)   |  

the  provisions of clause 15;

    
---|--- 
    

       (b)   |  

the  person seeking access providing reasonable justification that the same 
is  required;

    
---|--- 
    

       (c)   |  

access  being given only during working hours;

    
---|--- 
    

       (d)   |  

any  restrictions on access imposed by law or the terms of any agreement; 
and

    
---|--- 
    

       (e)   |  

any  claim for legal privilege.

    
---|--- 
    

 

9.2 For  a period of seven years following the Completion Date, neither Kerr-
McGee nor  the Buyer shall dispose of or destroy (and each shall procure that
its  respective Affiliates do not dispose of or destroy) any of the Records
without  first giving the other at least two months' notice of its intention
to do so and  giving the other a reasonable opportunity to remove and retain
any of them  (at  that other person's expense).

 

 

9.3 Without  prejudice to any information, access or assistance required
under  clauses 7.5,  8.8  or 8.9,  the Buyer shall (and shall procure that
each member of the Buyer Group shall),  at Kerr-McGee's expense and on
reasonable notice from Kerr-McGee, give such  assistance to any member of the
Kerr-McGee Group as Kerr-McGee may reasonably  request in relation to any
third party proceedings by or against any member  of  the Kerr-McGee Group
so far as the same relate to the Assets, including  proceedings relating to
taxation.

 

 

9.4 This  clause 9  shall not apply to the process for ascertaining the
Final Completion Statement  or in relation to any investigation of any actual
or potential claim or dispute  in connection with this Agreement.

 

 

**10.** **Taxation**

 

 

Schedule 8  shall apply in relation to taxation.

 

 

**11.** **Transition  Period**

so to do having  regard to the provisions of the relevant Operating
Agreements and Unit  Agreements:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

       (a)   |  

continue  to carry on its activities in relation to the Assets in all

       (b)   |  

consult  with the Buyer with regard to any material decisions relating to
the  Assets and co-operate with the Buyer so as to ensure an efficient
handover  of the Assets on Completion; and

    
---|--- 
    

       (c)   |  

insofar  as reasonably practicable, keep the Buyer informed in a timely
manner  on  any and all matters (not of a routine or minor nature) relating
to  the  Assets.

    
---|--- 
    

 

11.2 During  the Transition Period, subject to its obligations under clause
11.1  and its obligations to comply with the terms of the Asset Documents
Kerr-McGee  shall:

 

       (a)   |  

not,  except with the prior written approval of the Buyer (such approval 
not to  be unreasonably withheld or delayed) enter into any agreement
relating  to  the sale transportation or processing of gas, condensate or
any other  liquids arising from the Assets or amend, terminate or agree to
amend  or  terminate any of the Asset Documents in any material respect in
so  far as  such amendment, termination or agreement to amend or terminate

       (c)   |  

if  it considers reasonably and in good faith that a particular matter  or 
proposal is of a nature which may have a material adverse effect on  the 
value of the Assets, notify the Buyer in writing, consult (to the extent 
reasonably practicable) with the Buyer in relation to that matter or 
proposal, take account of any reasonable representation which the Buyer  may
make and, provided always that such action shall not be prejudicial  to  any
of Kerr-McGee's other business interests and Kerr-McGee shall not be  in
breach of any contractual, legal, statutory or regulatory requirement 
whatsoever by doing so, carry out the wishes of the Buyer in so far  as it 
is reasonable to do so following such consultation;  and

    
---|--- 
    

       (d)   |  

to  the extent practicable in the circumstances consult with the Buyer  in 
relation to any matter requiring its vote under any Operating Agreement  and

11.3 Subject  to the provisions of this Agreement, the Buyer shall accept the
Assets in the  physical condition in which they exist at the date of this

the date of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding clause 12  or any other
provisions to the contrary, the Buyer shall with effect from the  date of
this Agreement be obliged to effect and maintain appropriate insurance  in
respect of the Assets and the Buyer shall accordingly have no benefit of 
any  insurance maintained by Kerr-McGee in respect of the Assets.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 

**12.** **Indemnity**

 

 

12.1 The  provisions of this clause 12  shall only take effect once

receipt thereof (or, in the case of Obligations, within ten  (10) Business
Days of receipt of notification from the Party which has incurred  such
Obligations) in each case, to Kerr-McGee's Account or the Buyer's Account 
(as the case may be). Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, 
each  Party undertakes to provide written advice to the other Party of any
event  giving rise to an adjustment under this clause 12  within fifteen
(15) Business Days of becoming aware of such an event. Such  advice will
include a copy of such documentary evidence as is reasonably  necessary to
enable the other Party to verify the adjustment.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

12.6 For  the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this  clause 12,  the Buyer shall at its cost and expense perform and
shall be responsible for  decommissioning, abandonment, removing and making
safe all plant, equipment  and  machinery, wells and other installations
(including offshore installations,  pipelines and submarine pipelines) and

and any Operating Agreement or other Asset  Document to the extent that such
obligations are attributable to the Assets  whether under or pursuant to any
of the Asset Documents or under statutory  obligation, common law,
international law, international convention or any  other  obligation. The
Buyer covenants that it shall indemnify and hold Kerr-McGee  and  its
Connected Persons harmless against any and all Losses and Expenses which 
Kerr-McGee or any of its Connected Persons may incur arising out of or in 
connection with the Decommissioning Liabilities regardless of whensoever
such  Decommissioning Liabilities may arise or may have arisen, regardless
of  whosoever is or was a licensee under the relevant Licence or a party to
the  relevant Operating Agreement or owned or leased the relevant property
and  regardless of whether such Losses and Expenses arise as a consequence
of  negligence on the part of Kerr-McGee or any of its Connected Persons or
any  other person provided that for the avoidance of doubt the Buyer shall
not be  required to reimburse Kerr-McGee for amounts actually expended by
Kerr-McGee  prior to the Effective Date in respect of Decommissioning 
Liabilities.

 

 

12.7 The  Buyer is hereby notified that detectable amounts of hazardous
substances  (including chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects, and
reproductive  harm  or any other harm) may be found in, on, or around the
Assets. In addition,  the  Buyer acknowledges that some oil field production

),  asbestos and/or other hazardous substances. In this regard, the Buyer
expressly  understands that NORM and other hazardous substances may affix or
attach itself  to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale or in
other forms,  and  that wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets
may contain NORM  and  other hazardous substances and that materials
containing NORM and other  hazardous substances may be buried or have been
otherwise disposed of on or  under the Assets. The Buyer also expressly
understands that special procedures  may be required for the removal and
disposal of NORM, asbestos and other  hazardous substances from the Assets
where it may be found, and that the Buyer  assumes all liability and
responsibility for such activities when and if  performed after the Effective
Date.

 

 

12.8 Notwithstanding  the other provisions of this clause 12,  the Buyer
covenants that it shall indemnify and hold Kerr-McGee and its  Connected
Persons harmless against any Losses and Expenses which Kerr-McGee  or  any
of its Connected Persons may incur arising out of or in connection with 
the  Environmental Liabilities regardless of whensoever such Environmental 
Liabilities may arise or may have arisen, regardless of whosoever is or was 
a  licensee under the relevant Licence or a party to the relevant Operating 
Agreement or owned or leased the relevant property.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

12.9 Upon  Kerr-McGee's request from time to time, the Buyer will support any
application  by Kerr-McGee to obtain from the relevant authorities an
irrevocable release  of  Kerr-McGee from its obligations and liabilities
under the Petroleum Act 1998  or  other relevant statute, regulations, order
from any competent authority or  guidelines and all notices and regulations
served and issued pursuant thereto,  insofar as the same relate to the
Assets. Without prejudice to the foregoing,  if, following the Completion
Date, the Secretary of State requests that  Kerr-McGee prepares and
implements a programme or requirement for or in respect  of any part of the
Decommissioning Liabilities, whether pursuant to the terms  of  the
Petroleum Act 1998 or other relevant statute, regulations, order from any 
competent authority or guidelines, Kerr-McGee shall do so in accordance with 
the  requirements of the Petroleum Act 1998 or other relevant statute,
regulation,  order or guidelines, as the case may be, and all other relevant
statutes,  regulations, orders and guidelines and the indemnities in  clause
12.6  and 12.8  shall extend to all Losses and Expenses incurred by or on
behalf of Kerr-McGee  in the preparation and implementation of such
programme.

 

 

12.10 Without  prejudice to the provisions of clauses 12.2,  12.3  and
12.4,  any Benefits or Obligations (including the cost of any audit) accruing
in  respect of the Assets in the form of amounts receivable or payable
resulting  from an audit pursuant to a Operating Agreement or from any other
subsequent  adjustment in relation to the operation of, and expenditure
attributable to,  the  Assets in the period prior to the Effective Date
shall accrue to Kerr-McGee  and  any such Benefits or Obligations
attributable to the Assets in the period from  and after the Effective Date
shall accrue to the Buyer. Where any such audit  takes place after the
Completion Date, the Buyer shall promptly notify Kerr  Mc  Gee thereof and
shall be obliged to take account of Kerr-McGee's reasonable  representations
in connection with such audit and to notify Kerr-McGee of any  audit
adjustment as soon as practicable after the results of such audit are  known.
If, as a result of any audit adjustment or otherwise, either Kerr-McGee  or
the Buyer is, on the principles set out in clauses 12.2,  12.3  and 12.4, 
so liable to pay any amount to the other, then, to the extent that the same 
has  not been taken into account or falls to be taken into account in the
Net  Adjustment Amount, or the amount has not otherwise been paid in
accordance  with  clause 12.4,  such amount shall be paid to Kerr-McGee's
Account or the Buyer's Account (as  appropriate) within thirty (30) Business
Days after the amount receivable or  payable as a result of such an audit or
other subsequent adjustment has been  taken into account by the relevant
Operator in the Operator's billing  statement.

 

 

12.11 The  Buyer and Kerr-McGee shall use all reasonable endeavours to
procure the  unconditional and irrevocable release of Kerr-McGee and its
Affiliates from  all  guarantees and indemnities to which Kerr-McGee or any
of its Affiliates is  a  party (the Kerr-McGee Guarantees) given in the
ordinary course of business  related to the operations of the Assets. The
Buyer covenants that it shall  indemnify and hold Kerr-McGee and its
Affiliates harmless against all Losses  and  Expenses which Kerr-McGee or
any of its Affiliates may incur arising out of  or  in connection with any
of the Kerr-McGee Guarantees which have not been  discharged on or before
Completion, in respect of Losses or Expenses incurred  in  respect of the
period after the Effective Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

12.12 Paragraphs 7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12,  13,  and 15  of Schedule
3  (Limitations on Liabilities) shall apply to any Claim made under this 
Clause 12.

 

 

12.13 Notwithstanding  anything herein provided to the contrary, Kerr-McGee
and the Buyer do hereby  covenant and agree that the recovery by either Party
hereto of any damages  suffered or incurred by it as a result of any breach
by the other party of  any  of its covenants, agreements, representations,
guaranties, warranties,  indemnities, disclaimers, waivers or continuing
obligations under this Agreement  shall be limited to the actual damages
suffered or incurred by the non-breaching  party as a result of such breach,
and in no event shall such recovery include  any indirect, consequential,
exemplary or punitive damages.

 

 

12.14 If  final judgement which is not capable of being appealed by Kerr-
McGee is obtained  against Kerr-McGee as a result of the breach of a Kerr-
McGee Warranty and such  judgement provides for the payment of damages to the
Buyer by Kerr-McGee,  Kerr-McGee may not claim to be indemnified by the Buyer
against the cost of  paying such damages to the Buyer provided that

 

       (a)   |  

notwithstanding  this clause 12.14  Kerr-McGee shall at all times and in all
