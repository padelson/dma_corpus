"Estimated Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount") and (v) the Estimated

2.4 Post-Closing Adjustment. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than sixty (60) days after the Execution Date, Buyer will deliver
to Sellers the Preliminary Closing Statement setting forth the Buyer's good
faith estimate of the Closing Working Capital, the Net Cash Change, the
Closing Imbalance and the Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount, together with
supporting records. Buyer will make available to Sellers and their
Representatives, as reasonably requested by Sellers, all Records and other
documents used by Buyer in preparing the Preliminary Closing Statement.



2.5 Review of Preliminary Closing Statement.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30)
days after Sellers receive the Preliminary Closing Statement (the "Objection
Period"), Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a written report containing all
changes (if any) that Sellers propose to be made to such Preliminary Closing
Statement (the "Objection Notice"). Such changes shall be specified in
reasonable detail with reasonable supporting documentation, if applicable, and
include Sellers' calculation of Closing Working Capital, the Net Cash Change,
the Closing Imbalance and the Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount. All items
on the Preliminary Closing Statement for which Sellers do not propose changes
shall be deemed to be final and binding on the Parties. If Sellers fail to
deliver to Buyer the Objection Notice within the Objection Period, the
Preliminary Closing Statement as delivered by Buyer will be deemed to be final
and binding on the Parties.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ten (10)
days after Buyer receives the Objection Notice, the Parties shall meet and
undertake to agree on the final adjustments to the Preliminary Closing
Statement. If the Parties fail to agree on the final adjustments within the
fifteen (15) day period after Buyer's receipt of the Objection Notice, any
Party may submit the disputed items to the Independent Accountant for
resolution. The Parties shall direct the Independent Accountant to resolve the
disputes within thirty (30) days after the relevant materials are submitted
for review. The Independent Accountant shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Preliminary Closing Statement as to which Sellers proposed
changes in the Objection Notice and that remain in dispute between the
Parties, shall render its decision based solely on written materials submitted
by the Parties and the terms of this Agreement and shall not assign a value to
any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by the Parties
or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by the Parties. The
Independent Accountant shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resort to
the Independent Accountant as provided in this Section 2.5(b) shall be the
sole recourse and remedy of the Parties against one another or any other
Person with respect to, any disputes arising out of or relating to the
Preliminary Closing Statement. The decisions of the Independent Accountant
will be binding on and non-appealable by the Parties, and shall be enforceable
in a court of law. The fees and expenses associated with the Independent
Accountant shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%)
by Sellers.

(c) The Preliminary Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the
Parties with respect to the determination of Closing Working Capital, Net Cash
Change, the Closing Imbalance and the Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount
upon the earliest of (i) if no Objection Notice has been given within the
Objection Period, the expiration of the Objection Period, (ii) if an Objection
Notice has been given during the Objection Period, upon the agreement by the
Parties that such Preliminary Closing Statement, together with any
modifications thereto agreed to in writing by the Parties, is final and
binding and (iii) if an Objection Notice has been given but there is no
agreement between the Parties regarding Sellers' proposed changes, the date on
which the Independent Accountant issues its decision with respect to any
dispute referred to the Independent Accountant pursuant to Section 2.5(b),
giving effect to any items reflected in the Objection Notice as to which the
Parties were able to reach agreement prior to such referral. The Preliminary
Closing Statement, as adjusted, if applicable, pursuant to any agreement
between the Parties or pursuant to the decision of the Independent Accountant,
when final and binding with respect to the determination



of the Closing Working Capital, the Net Cash Change, the Closing Imbalance and
the Capital Expenditure Adjustment Amount, is herein referred to as the "Final
Closing Statement".

(d) If the Final Amount is less than the Estimated Amount (a "Final
Deficiency"), Buyer shall deliver written notice to the Escrow Agent and
Sellers specifying the amount of such Final Deficiency and the Escrow Agent
shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of the such notice, (i) deliver the
amount of the Final Deficiency to a bank account designated in writing by
Buyer and (ii) deliver an amount, if any, equal to the Escrow Cash Amount,
plus any interest or earnings thereon, less the Final Deficiency, to the bank
account or bank accounts designated in writing by Sellers; provided, however,
that if the Final Deficiency amount is greater than the Escrow Cash Amount
(together with any interest or earnings thereon) Sellers shall, within two (2)
days, deliver the amount, in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, by which the Final Deficiency amount is greater than the Escrow Cash
Amount (together with any interest or earnings thereon) to a bank account
designated in writing by Buyer. If the Final Amount is greater than the
Estimated Amount (a "Final Surplus"), Buyer shall, within ten (10) days after
the Final Closing Statement has been established pursuant to Section 2.5(c),
(x) deliver the amount of the Final Surplus to the bank account or bank
accounts designated in writing by Sellers and (y) cause the Escrow Agent to
deliver an amount equal to the Escrow Cash Amount plus any interest or
earnings thereon to the bank account or bank accounts designated in writing by
Sellers.

(e) If, after the Execution Date, either Party receives funds that, as between
the Parties, indisputably belong to the other, such amounts shall be promptly
disbursed to the Party entitled to receive them. If an invoice or other
evidence of an obligation is received by a Party, which is either an
obligation of the other Party pursuant to this Agreement or partially an
obligation of both Sellers and Buyer, the Parties shall consult with each
other, and an adjustment for such amount will be made either on the Final
Closing Statement or, if the evidence of the obligation is not received until
after the Final Closing Statement has been established, in cash as the Parties
may agree.

2.6 Payment of Indebtedness. Schedule 2.6 includes a complete list, with all
relevant contact information, of each Person to whom the Company or the
Entities owe Indebtedness as of the Execution Date (each, a "Lender", and
together, the "Lenders") (such Indebtedness, the "Closing Indebtedness").
Sellers have delivered to Buyer payoff letters from each Lender (together, the
"Payoff Letters") providing for the complete repayment, satisfaction and/or
release as of the Closing of all of the Closing Indebtedness to all Lenders
and the complete release of any Lien any Lender may have against the Company,
the Entities or any of the Assets. At the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of the
Company and the Entities, shall cause payments to be made to the Lenders in
the amounts set forth in the Payoff Letters and to the accounts designated for
such payments.

2.7 Purchase Price Allocation. For the purpose of making the requisite
filings, if any, under Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations issued
thereunder, the Parties agree that they will report the federal, state, and
other Tax consequences of the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement in a manner consistent with the allocation determined by the Parties
as set forth in this Section 2.7 (the "Allocation Schedule"). Buyer shall
deliver a draft Allocation Schedule to Sellers within ninety (90) days after
the Execution Date. Buyer and the Sellers shall use their



commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon the Allocation Schedule within
forty five (45) days of the delivery of the draft Allocation Schedule. If the
Parties are not able to agree on the final Allocation Schedule within forty
five (45) days after the delivery of the schedule to Sellers, a third-party
appraiser selected jointly by Buyer and Sellers, the fees of which shall be
borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers, shall resolve the allocation
of the consideration to any items with respect to which there is a dispute
between the Parties. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the Parties
agree to act, and cause their respective Affiliates to act, in accordance with
the computations and allocations contained in the Allocation Schedule in any
relevant Tax returns or similar filings (the "1060 Forms"), to cooperate in
the preparation of any 1060 Forms, to file such 1060 Forms in the manner
required by applicable Law, to update such 1060 Forms in accordance with the
method used in making the allocation to the extent necessary to reflect
purchase price adjustments and to not take any position inconsistent with such
Allocation Schedule upon examination of any Tax returns, in any litigation or
otherwise. The Parties acknowledge that the purchase price allocation is
solely for income tax purposes.

2.8 Tax Withholding. Buyer may withhold any amount from the Cash Consideration
Amount that it is required by applicable Tax law to withhold, and any such
amount withheld, to the extent paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Authority, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to Sellers; provided, however, that if, on or prior to the Execution
Date, each Seller provides Buyer with a Non-Foreign Certificate and Buyer is
otherwise permitted to rely on such certificate under Treasury Regulations §
1.1445-2, Buyer shall not withhold any amount under Section 1445 of the Code.

401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and, to Sellers' Knowledge,
nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to cause the revocation
of such determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service or the
unavailability of reliance on such opinion letter from the Internal Revenue
Service, as applicable or require the filing of a submission under the IRS's
employee plans compliance resolution system or the taking of other corrective
action pursuant to such system in order to maintain the qualified or exempt
status of such Company Benefit Plan. All benefits, contributions and premiums
required by and due under the terms of each Company Benefit Plan or applicable
Law and any applicable collective bargaining agreement have been timely paid
in accordance with the terms of such Company Benefit Plan, the terms of all
applicable Laws and GAAP and all obligations in respect of each Company
Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and reflected in the Financial
Statements. With respect to any Company Benefit Plan, to Sellers' Knowledge,
no event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that has resulted in
or would subject the Company, any Entity or any ERISA Affiliate to a Tax under
Section 4971 of the Code or the assets of the Company, any Entity or any ERISA
Affiliate to a lien under Section 430(k) of the Code.

(d) (i) There has been no non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is
defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan; (ii) there are no Claims pending with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) or, to Sellers'
Knowledge, threatened or anticipated against any Company Benefit Plan or
against the assets of any Company Benefit Plan, or the Company, any Entity or
any ERISA Affiliate with respect to any Company Benefit Plan; (iii) to the
Sellers' Knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist that could give rise to
any such Claims; (iv) no written or oral communication has been received from
any Governmental Authority concerning the funded status of any Company Benefit
Plan or any transfer of assets or liabilities from or to any Company Benefit
Plan; (v) there is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
Governmental Authority outstanding against or in favor of any Company Benefit
Plan, and there are no pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened audits or
investigations by any Governmental Authority involving any Company Benefit
Plan; and (vi) all payments, awards, grants or bonuses made or other property
provided pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan have been or will be, fully
deductible by the Company or the Entities.

(e) There does not now exist, nor do circumstances exist that could be
reasonably expected to result in any Controlled Group Liability of the
Company, any Entity or any ERISA Affiliate that would be, or could become, a
liability following the Execution Date of Buyer or any



of its Affiliates. As used in the preceding sentence, the term "Controlled
Group Liability" means liabilities arising (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii)
under Sections 206(g), 302 or 303 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412, 430,
431, 436 or 4971 of the Code or (iv) as a result of the failure to comply with
the continuation of coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and
Section 4980B of the Code.

(f) No Company Benefit Plan (i) is subject to the minimum funding standards of
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; (ii) is a "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) ("Multiemployer Plan"); (iii) is
a multiple employer welfare arrangement (within the meaning of Section 3(4) of
ERISA) ("Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement"); or (iv) is a single employer
plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not
under common control (within the meaning of Section 4063(a) of ERISA), and
neither the Company nor any of the Entities nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever
contributed to or had an obligation to contribute, or incurred any liability
in respect of a contribution, to any Multiemployer Plan, Multiple Employer
Welfare Arrangement, or single employer plan with two or more contributing
sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control. Neither the
Company nor any of the Entities (x) has withdrawn from any pension plan under
circumstances resulting (or expected to result) in a liability to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or (y) has engaged in any transaction which would
give rise to a liability of the Company, the Entities or Buyer under Section
4069 or Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

(g) No Company Benefit Plan has within the two (2) years prior to the
Execution Date been the subject of an examination or audit by a Governmental
Authority.

(h) No Company Benefit Plan exists that could (i) result in the payment to any
Employee or any consultant of the Company or the Entities of any money or
other property; (ii) accelerate the vesting of or provide any additional
rights or benefits (including funding of compensation or benefits through a
trust or otherwise) to any Employee or any consultant of the Company or the
Entities, except as a result of any partial plan termination resulting from
this Agreement; or (iii) limit or restrict the ability of Buyer or its
Affiliates to merge, amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, in each
case, as a result of the execution of this Agreement or consummations of the
transaction contemplated hereby. Neither the execution of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code.

(i) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (within the
meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) has been operated in compliance in
all material respects with the group health plan continuation coverage
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 of
ERISA ("COBRA Coverage") or similar state law, Section 4980D of the Code, Part
7, Subtitle B, Title I of ERISA, Title XXII of the U.S. Public Health Service
Act and the provisions of the U.S. Social Security Act, to the extent such
requirements are applicable. No Company Benefit Plan or other written or oral
agreement exists which obligates the Company or any Entity to provide benefits
(whether or not insured) to any current or former employee, consultant or
other service provider of or to the Company or any Entity following such
current or former employee's or consultant's termination of employment or
consultancy with the Company or any



Entity, other than (i) COBRA Coverage or coverage mandated by state Law, or
(ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee pension benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA). No Company Benefit Plan is funded
through a "welfare benefit fund" as defined in Section 419 of the Code.

(j) Each compensation arrangement between any Employee and the Company or any
Entity and each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code materially complies with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of
the Code (and has so materially complied for the entire period during which
Section 409A of the Code has applied to such arrangement or Company Benefit
Plan). None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will constitute
or result in a deferral of compensation that violates Section 409A of the
Code.

(k) No Company Benefit Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the
United States or covers any Employee or consultant or independent contractor
or other service provider residing or working outside the United States, and
no material liability or obligation of the Company or an Entity exists with
respect to any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained
outside of the jurisdiction of the United States or covering any Employee or
consultant or independent contractor or other service provider residing or
working outside the United States.

the Entities and relating to the Owned Real Property. The use and operation of
the Owned Real Property does not materially violate any Law, covenant,
condition, restriction, easement or Permit. No material improvements
constituting a part of the Owned Real Property encroach on real property owned
or leased by a Person other than the Company or the Entities, and there are no
known encroachments by any third party upon any Owned Real



Property or any material improvements constituting a part thereof which would
materially affect the customary use of the Assets as intended hereunder. As of

has given notice to the Company or the Entities or, to Sellers' Knowledge,
threatened to give notice, of any action to terminate, cancel, rescind,
repudiate or procure a judicial reformation of any Easement or Lease. No

estate holder, is required to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

applicable Law.

(b) The Company and each Entity has complied in all material respects with all
applicable Laws relating to the hiring of employees and the employment of

(including by class of employee), leased employees, consultants and
independent contractors, and has withheld and paid all applicable Taxes and
made all required filings in connection with services provided by such
persons. Any individual who performs services for the Company or any Entity
and who is not treated as an employee of such Person for federal income Tax

Entities as is customary in type and amount in the industry in which the
Company and the Entities operate. All such Insurance Policies are in full

and, at the present time, would be able to afford a complete loss of such
investment and (c) is not an entity formed for the specific purpose of
acquiring the Consideration Units.

ARTICLE VI 
TITLE MATTERS



6.1 General Disclaimer of Title Representations and Warranties. Except for the
warranty of title set forth in Section 6.2, Sellers make no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the
Company's or the Entities' title to any of the Company Real Property and Buyer
hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except for cases of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, Buyer's sole remedy for any Title Defect, with respect to
any of the Company Real Property, shall be pursuant to the warranty of title
set forth in Section 6.2.

6.2 Warranty of Title. Sellers warrant title to property set forth on Schedule
6.2 unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim
the same or any part thereof, subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances;
provided, however, that, except with respect to any liability of Sellers with
respect to a breach of such warranty (each a "Warranty Breach") as the result
of a Claim asserted in writing by Buyer to Sellers in accordance with Section
6.3 on or before the expiration of the Survival Period, such warranty shall
cease and terminate at the end of such Survival Period. Said warranty of title
shall be subject to the further limitations and provisions of this ARTICLE VI.

6.3 Recovery on Warranty. During the period commencing as of the Execution
Date and ending on the first anniversary thereof (the "Survival Period"),
Buyer shall furnish to Sellers a Warranty Breach Notice setting forth any
matters which Buyer intends to assert as Warranty Breaches. Sellers shall have
a reasonable opportunity, but not the obligation, to cure any Warranty Breach
asserted by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.3. Sellers shall notify Buyer of
any intention to cure any Warranty Breach within ten (10) days of receipt of a
Warranty Breach Notice or Sellers shall be deemed to have waived the right to
cure such Warranty Breach. Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate and, from and
after the Execution Date, to cause the Company and the Entities to reasonably
cooperate, with any attempt by Sellers to cure any such Warranty Breach.

6.4 Waiver of Title Defects. For all purposes of this Agreement and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (a) the term Warranty Breach
shall include without limitation any title-related matter that materially
prejudices Buyer's ability to use and operate the property set forth on
Schedule 6.2 as currently used or as currently contemplated to be used and (b)
Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Sellers shall have no further
liability for, any Warranty Breach that Buyer fails to assert by a Warranty
Breach Notice given to Sellers on or before the expiration of the Survival
Period. Nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver of any claim arising
from an intentional non-disclosure of any defect in title, including a Title
Defect.

6.5 Title Dispute Resolution.

(h) Sellers and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all (i) Claims of Warranty
Breaches and (ii) the related Warranty Breach Amounts, in each case, prior to
the expiration of the Survival Period. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to
agree prior to the expiration of the Survival Period, the Warranty Breaches
and Warranty Breach Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally
resolved pursuant to this Section 6.5(a) (each, a "Title Dispute").

(i) There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at
least fifteen (15) years' experience in pipeline and gathering system title
matters involving properties in the regional area in which the Warranty Breach
Property is located, as selected by mutual agreement



of Buyer and Sellers within twenty (20) Days after the end of the Survival
Period, and absent such agreement, by the Houston office of the AAA (the
"Title Arbitrator").

(j) The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas, and shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA, to
the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Agreement. The
Title Arbitrator's determination of the Title Dispute shall be made within
twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final
and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his or her
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in
this ARTICLE VI, and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other
matters as, in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator, are necessary to make a
proper determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, may not attribute to any
Warranty Breach a greater Warranty Breach Amount than the Warranty Breach
Amount claimed by Buyer in the applicable Warranty Breach Notice nor a lesser
Warranty Breach Amount than the Warranty Breach Amount admitted to by Sellers.

(k) Sellers and Buyer shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Sellers bear fifty percent (50%) and Buyer shall bear
fifty percent (50%) of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator.

(l) Within ten (10) days after (i) the Title Arbitrator delivers written
notice to Buyer and Sellers of his or her decision with respect to a Title
Dispute, if such decision determines that the Warranty Breach claimed by Buyer
in the applicable Warranty Breach Notice did occur or (ii) the Parties agree
that any amount is payable to Buyer pursuant to this ARTICLE VI, Buyer shall
provide the Escrow Agent notice of such determination and Escrow Agent shall
deliver to Buyer (A) an amount equal to the amount awarded by the Title
Arbitrator or otherwise agreed by the Parties, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account designated by Buyer, which amount will be
paid with cash from dividends, earnings or other distributions on Common Units
in the Escrow Fund and (B) to the extent there is not sufficient cash from
dividends, earnings or other distributions on Common Units in the Escrow Fund
to pay the required amount, by delivery of the number of Consideration Units
held in the Escrow Fund equal to (x) the difference between (1) the amount
awarded to Buyer by the Title Arbitrator and (2) the amount distributed
pursuant to clause (A) of this sentence, divided by (y) the Market Price.

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no event shall the aggregate
liability of Sellers pursuant to this ARTICLE VI, aggregated with all
liability of Sellers pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, exceed Forty Million Dollars
($40,000,000); provided, however, that no Claims of Warranty Breaches arising
out of fraud or intentional misrepresentation shall be limited by this Section
6.5(f).

"Seller Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses incurred by a Seller
Indemnitee as a result of or arising out of (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of Buyer or

agreements delivered at Closing.

(o) With respect to the obligations of Buyer under Section 8.1 or Sellers

(ii) none of the Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, shall
be entitled to assert any right to indemnification unless the Losses resulting
from all Claims asserted by Buyer Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees pursuant
to this ARTICLE VIII in the aggregate exceed Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000),
and then only to the extent that all such Losses exceed said amount; provided,
however, that no Losses relating to a Claim for indemnification arising out of
(A) a violation of a Fundamental Representation, (B) the breach of any
covenant, (C) fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (D) Sections 3.40,
8.2(a)(iii), 8.2(a)(iv) or 8.2(b) shall be limited by, or apply toward the
limit contained in, this Section 8.3(b)(ii);

(iii) in no event shall the aggregate liability of Buyer pursuant to this
ARTICLE VIII or the aggregate liability of Sellers pursuant to this ARTICLE
VIII and ARTICLE VI exceed Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000); provided,
however, that no Losses relating to a Claim for indemnification arising out of
(A) a violation of a Fundamental Representation, (B) the breach of any
covenant, (C) fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (D) Sections
8.2(a)(iii) and 8.2(a)(iv) shall be limited by, or apply toward the limit
contained in, this Section 8.3(b)(iii);

(iv) in no event shall the aggregate liability of Sellers pursuant to Section

arising out of fraud or intentional misrepresentation shall be limited by, or
apply toward the limit contained in, this Section 8.3(b)(iv);

(v) for purposes of this ARTICLE VIII, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, and the amount of any Loss,
shall be determined without regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect
or other similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable thereto.

(p) Any Claim for indemnification under this Agreement made by a Seller
Indemnitee or a Buyer Indemnitee shall (i) be in writing, (ii) be based upon a
Claim that is actually asserted or Loss actually incurred, (iii) be delivered
in good faith prior to the respective survival period under Section 8.3(b)(i)
and (iv) specify in reasonable detail the specific nature of the Claim for
indemnification hereunder ("Claim Notice"). Any such Claim that is described
in a timely delivered Claim Notice shall survive from and after the applicable
survival period under Section 8.3(b)(i) with respect to the specific matter
described therein.

8.4 Notice of Asserted Liability; Opportunity to Defend.

(c) All Claims for indemnification hereunder (other than with respect to
Section 8.2(b), which will be governed by Section 8.11) shall be asserted and
handled pursuant to Section 8.3(c) and this Section 8.4. Any Person claiming
indemnification hereunder is referred to herein as the "Indemnified Party" or
"Indemnitee" and any Person against whom such Claims are asserted hereunder is
referred to herein as the "Indemnifying Party" or "Indemnitor."



(d) If a Claim is asserted against an Indemnified Party or any Loss is sought
to be collected by any Indemnified Party from an Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness provide to the Indemnifying
Party a Claim Notice. The failure to give any such Claim Notice shall not
affect the rights of the Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder unless
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby and then only to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

(e) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of the
Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether
the Indemnifying Party disputes liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder
with respect to the Claim or Loss, and (ii) in the case where Claims are
asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party by a
Third Person ("Third Person Claim"), whether the Indemnifying Party desires to
defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Person Claim (which defense
shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, and with
counsel of its own choosing and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party); provided, however, that any Indemnified Party is hereby authorized,
until the Indemnifying Party provides notice that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Person Claim, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading, or to take any other reasonable action, that it deems
necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying
Party (and of which it shall have given reasonable prior notice and
opportunity to comment to the Indemnifying Party) and not prejudicial to the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party
and its Representatives and other professional advisors to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Third Person Claim, and
whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of such Third
Person Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's
investigation by giving such reasonable information and assistance (including
access to the Indemnified Party's premises and personnel and the right to
examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party
or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.

(f) If the Indemnifying Party (i) does not give notice to the Indemnified
Party of its election to contest and defend any such Third Person Claim within
the Notice Period or (ii) elects not to defend any such Third Person Claim,
then the Indemnifying Party shall nonetheless remain responsible for all the
out of pocket costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party's defense (including
legal fees and expenses); provided, that if the Indemnifying Party disputes
its potential liability to the Indemnified Party under this Section 8.4 and if
such dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be required to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified
Party's defense pursuant to this Section 8.4. In the instances described in
clauses (i) and (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 8.4(d), the
Indemnified Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings;
provided that (x) the Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Person Claim
without providing twenty (20) days' prior written notice of its intent to
settle such claim and (y) if the Indemnified Party settles any Third Person
Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, the settlement of such
Third Person Claim shall not prevent the Indemnifying Party from contesting
the issue of whether (i) such Third Person Claim is within the scope of and
subject to indemnification under this Agreement and/or (ii) the amount for
which the Indemnifying Party would be liable to indemnify the Indemnified
Party as a result of such settlement exceeds the amount which the Indemnifying
Party would otherwise have been likely required to indemnify the



Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement (the "Non-Settlement
Indemnification Amount"), in which case the liability of the Indemnifying
Party in connection with such Third Person Claim will be limited to the Non-
Settlement Indemnification Amount. The Indemnifying Party may participate in,
but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by an Indemnified Party,
and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect
to such participation.

(g) If the Indemnifying Party is obligated to defend and indemnify the
Indemnified Party, and (i) the Parties have a conflict of interest with
respect to any such Third Person Claim, (ii) there are legal defenses
available to an Indemnified Party that are different or in addition to those
available to the Indemnifying Party or (iii) the Indemnifying Party fails to
diligently defend such Third Person Claim, then the Indemnified Party may, in
its sole discretion, separately and independently contest and defend such
Third Person Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result
obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnified Party and shall be
responsible for all out of pocket costs incurred in connection therewith
(including legal fees and expenses).

(h) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice
Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend all appropriate
Proceedings, with counsel of its own choosing and reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party, and such Proceedings shall be promptly settled or
prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion. If the Indemnified
Party desires to participate in any such defense or settlement it may do so at
its sole cost and expense (subject to Section 8.4(e)). If the Indemnified
Party joins in any such Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
nevertheless have full authority to determine all action to be taken with
respect thereto, subject to the last sentence of Section 8.4(g) and all of
Section 8.4(h); provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall have full
authority and the right to direct the defense of any Third Person Claim that
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party,
at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.

(i) Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party and its counsel in
contesting any Third Person Claim and in making any counterclaim against the
Third Person asserting the Third Person Claim, or any cross-complaint against
any Person. No Third Person Claim may be settled or otherwise compromised
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless such
settlement (i) includes a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the
matter releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such
Third Person Claim, or (ii) would not restrict the Indemnified Party's ability
to conduct its business in the ordinary course.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree, in each case, that (i) subjects the Indemnified Party to any criminal
liability, (ii) requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of
the Indemnified Party or (iii) requires any payment from the Indemnified Party
without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(k) At any time after the commencement of defense of any Third Person Claim,
the Indemnifying Party may request the Indemnified Party to agree in writing
to the abandonment



of such contest or to the settlement, payment or compromise by the
Indemnifying Party of the asserted Third Person Claim, but only if the
Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to be solely liable for such Third Person
Claim; whereupon such action shall be taken unless the Indemnified Party
determines that the contest should be continued and notifies the Indemnifying
Party in writing within fifteen (15) days of such request from the
Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnified Party determines that
the contest should be continued, the amount for which the Indemnifying Party
would otherwise be liable hereunder shall not exceed the amount which the
Indemnifying Party had agreed to pay to compromise such Third Person Claim;
provided that, the other Person to the contested Third Person Claim had agreed
in writing to accept such amount in payment or compromise of the Third Person
Claim as of the time the Indemnifying Party made its request therefor to the
Indemnified Party, and further provided that, under such proposed compromise,
the Indemnified Party would be fully and completely released from any further
liability or obligation with respect to the matters which are the subject of
such contested Third Person Claim.

(l) With respect to any Claim made directly by an Indemnified Party to an
Indemnifying Party and not involving a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"),
the Indemnified Party shall assert such Claim by delivering a Claim Notice to
the Indemnifying Party reasonably promptly after becoming aware of such Direct
Claim and the Indemnifying Party shall then have thirty (30) days to respond
in writing to the Indemnified Party after its receipt of the Claim Notice. If
the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within the initial thirty (30) day
period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such Claim, in
which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may
be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its Representatives and other professional advisors to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Third Party
Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of such
Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying
Party's investigation by giving such reasonable information and assistance
(including access to the Indemnified Party's premises and personnel and the
right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.
Any failure by the Indemnified Party to give reasonably prompt written notice
to the Indemnifying Party of a Direct Claim shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations unless, and then only to the extent
that, the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by reason of such failure.

(m) Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated
to be payable pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII, the Indemnifying Party shall
satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) days of such agreement or such
final, non-appealable adjudication by (i) if Buyer is the Indemnifying Party,
wire transfer of immediately available funds and (ii) if Sellers are the
Indemnifying Party, by causing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Buyer (A) an
amount equal to the agreed-upon or finally adjudicated Loss by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, which amount will be paid with cash from
dividends, earnings or other distributions on Common Units in the Escrow Fund
and (B) to the extent there is not sufficient cash from dividends, earnings or
other distributions on Common Units in the Escrow Fund to fulfill the required
amount, by delivery of the number of Common Units held in the Escrow Fund
equal to (x) the difference between (I) the agreed-upon or finally adjudicated
Loss and (II) the amount distributed pursuant to clause (A)



of this sentence, if any, divided by (y) the Market Price; provided, however,
that Sellers shall pay all Losses adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this
ARTICLE VIII arising pursuant to Sections 8.2(a)(iii) and 8.2(a)(iv) by wire
transfer to Buyer of immediately available funds. The Parties agree that if
the Indemnifying Party does not make full payment of any such obligations,
subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 8.3(b)(ii), 8.3(b)(iii),
8.3(b)(iv) and 8.6(a), if applicable, within such fifteen (15) day period, any
amount payable shall accrue interest from and including the date of agreement
of the Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable adjudication, at the
Interest Rate.

8.5 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants of
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any
of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or
any of its Representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate.

8.6 Escrow Fund.

(c) As a source of payment for the indemnities provided by Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Unit Amount shall be deposited by Buyer with the
Escrow Agent, such deposit to be governed by the terms set forth herein and in
the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, the Escrow Fund shall be
the sole and exclusive source of funds for satisfaction of all claims by Buyer
or Buyer Indemnitees for Losses pursuant to ARTICLE VI and ARTICLE VIII other
than Losses arising out of (i) a violation of a Fundamental Representation,
(ii) the breach of any covenant, (iii) fraud or intentional misrepresentation,
(iv) Sections 8.2(a)(iii) and 8.2(a)(iv).

(d) Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in
existence on the Execution Date and shall terminate on the later of: (i) the
Second Release Date, or (ii) the Commercial Completion Date (the period of
time from the Execution Date through and including such termination date is
referred to herein as the "Escrow Period"); provided, however, that the Escrow
Cash Amount shall be released prior to the termination of the Escrow Period
pursuant to Section 2.5(d); provided, further, that: (i) the First Release
Units shall be released on the First Release Date, and (ii) the Second Release
Units shall be released on the Second Release Date. Notwithstanding the
previous sentence, (i) to the extent that one or more Claim Notices has been
delivered to Sellers but not resolved as of the First Release Date or the
Second Release Date (as applicable, the "Relevant Release Date"), a number of
First Release Units or Second Release Units (as applicable, the "Relevant
Release Units") equal to (x) the amount of Losses that are the subject of the
Claim Notice and which exceed the Escrow Unit Earnings on the Relevant Release
Units divided by (y) the Market Price shall remain in the Escrow Fund beyond
the Relevant Release Date and shall be released upon the resolution of such
claim (such calculation method, the "Interim Holdback Calculation Method"),
and (ii) to the extent that one or more Claim Notices (an "Ongoing Claim
Notice") has been delivered to Sellers but not resolved as of the last day of
the Escrow Period, (x) Escrow Unit Earnings equal to the amount of Losses that
are the subject of the Ongoing Claim Notice and, (y) to the extent the Escrow
Unit Earnings in the Escrow Fund as of the last day of the Escrow Period are
less than the amount of Losses that are the subject of the Ongoing Claim
Notice,



a number of Common Units equal to (1) the amount of Losses that are the
subject of the Ongoing Claim Notice and which exceed the Escrow Unit Earnings
in the Escrow Fund as of the last day of the Escrow Period divided by (2) the
Market Price (such calculation method, the "Final Holdback Calculation
Method"), shall remain in the Escrow Fund beyond the last day of the Escrow
Period and shall be released upon the resolution of such claim. Should the
Second Release Date be the same date as the last day of the Escrow Period, the
Final Holdback Calculation Method and not the Interim Calculation Method, will
be used to calculate the amount of Consideration Units to remain in the Escrow
Fund following the Second Release Date.

8.7 Exclusive Remedy. EXCEPT FOR CASES OF FRAUD AND INTENTIONAL
MISREPRESENTATION, AS BETWEEN THE BUYER INDEMNITEES AND THE SELLER
INDEMNITEES, AFTER CLOSING (A) THE EXPRESS INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET
FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS AND
REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES (OTHER THAN THE FINAL SETTLEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTIONS
2.3 THROUGH 2.5 AND OTHER THAN EQUITABLE REMEDIES AS THEY RELATE TO BREACHES
OF COVENANTS OR OTHER AGREEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN TO THE EXTENT SUCH COVENANTS
OR AGREEMENTS ARE TO BE PERFORMED AFTER THE CLOSING) AND (B) NEITHER PARTY NOR
ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS SHALL HAVE ANY RIGHTS AGAINST THE
OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES AS TO THE SUBJECT MATTER CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT OTHER THAN AS IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

8.8 Negligence and Strict Liability Waiver. WITHOUT LIMITING OR ENLARGING THE
SCOPE OF THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO
INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS HEREOF,
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LOSS OR CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATION IS THE RESULT OF THE SOLE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OF OR BY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

8.9 Limitation on Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER SELLERS OR BUYER BE LIABLE
TO THE OTHER, OR TO THE OTHER'S INDEMNITEES, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, ANY DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, ANY DAMAGES FOR DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR
DAMAGES BASED ON ANY TYPE OF MULTIPLE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IF ANY OF THE
SELLER INDEMNITEES OR BUYER INDEMNITEES IS HELD LIABLE TO A THIRD PERSON FOR
ANY SUCH DAMAGES AND THE INDEMNITOR IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH SELLER

ARTICLE IX 
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

9.1 Expenses. Each of Sellers and Buyer will bear its own costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

9.2 Further Assurances. From time to time, and without further consideration,
each Party will, and will cause its Affiliates to, execute and deliver to the
other Party such documents, instruments and conveyances and take such actions
and provide such further assurances as the other Party may reasonably request
in order to more effectively implement the provisions hereof and effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents.

9.3 Apportionment of Taxes; Transfer Taxes; and Recording Fees; Tax Treatment.

(n) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period,
for the Company or the Entities the amount of any such Tax that is
attributable to the portion of the period ending on the Execution Date shall
be a Seller Tax and shall be:

(vi) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) or (C)
franchise or doing business Taxes, deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the Tax period ended with (and included) the Execution Date;
provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
allocated between the period ending on and including the Execution Date and
the period beginning after the Execution Date in proportion to the number of
days in each period; and

(vii) in the case of all Taxes not described in 9.3(a)(i), deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of calendar days in the portion



of the period ending on and including the Execution Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

(o) To the extent that Seller Taxes are known as of the Execution Date, such
Seller Taxes shall reduce the Closing Cash Consideration Amount. In all other
cases, Buyer shall prepare the Tax Returns for the Company and the Entities in
a manner consistent with the prior practices of the respective entities and,
except as otherwise required by Law, shall deliver such Tax Returns, within a
reasonable period of time prior to the date such returns are required to be
filed, to the Sellers for their review and comment prior to the filing
thereof. Sellers shall pay to Buyer, within fifteen (15) days of written
demand from Buyer, the amount of any Seller Tax to the extent not taken into
account as a reduction in the amount payable to Sellers under the first
sentence of this Section 9.3(b) and Sections 2.3 through 2.5.

(p) Subject to the apportionment of provisions of Sections 9.3(a)(ii) and
9.3(b), Buyer agrees to assume liability for the payment of all property Taxes
for the year of Closing and subsequent years and Sellers hereby agree to
retain liability for the payment of all property Taxes for years prior to the
year of Closing. If Buyer receives a statement or invoice concerning Taxes and
such statement relates to properties in addition to the Assets, the Parties
will cooperate in good faith to apportion and timely pay such property Taxes.

(q) Sellers and Buyer believe that this purchase and sale of the Assets is
exempt from or is otherwise not subject to any and all sales, use, transfer,
or similar Taxes. If any such sales, transfer, use or similar Taxes are due or
should hereafter become due (including penalty and interest thereon) by reason
of this transaction, Buyer and Sellers shall each be responsible for one-half
of such Taxes.

(r) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes (each, a "Tax
Proceeding") imposed on or with respect to the Assets or the operations or
activities of the Company or the Entities. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

(s) For U.S. federal income tax and any applicable state and local Tax
purposes, the sale and purchase of the Interests hereunder shall be treated
(i) in part as a sale by the Sellers of Interests (interests in a federal tax
partnership) in a transaction subject to Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code and
the applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) in part as
a contribution of Interests to the capital of Buyer Parent in exchange for an
interest therein under Section 721 of the Code. A portion of the Base Purchase
Price may be treated as a reimbursement of preformation expenditures as set
forth in Treasury Regulations § 1.707-4(d), and the Parties shall not take any
steps that would impair the ability of Sellers to report the full amount of
reimbursement of preformation expenditures that they may be entitled to as set
forth in the Treasury Regulations.



(t) If requested by Buyer, Sellers shall cause Costar Mesquite and Transtar to
each make an election under Section 754 of the Code for its Tax year ending
on, or that includes, the Execution Date. The Parties shall take all actions
necessary to cause each of Costar Mesquite and Transtar to make such election.

9.4 Assignment. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, provided that neither Party may assign this Agreement or any of its
rights or obligations arising hereunder without the prior written consent of
the other Party.

9.5 Entire Agreement, Amendments and Waiver. This Agreement, together with the
Transaction Documents and all certificates, documents, instruments and
writings that are delivered pursuant hereto and thereto contain the entire
understanding of the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and supersede all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings
relating to the subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality
Agreement (which is hereby ratified) shall terminate upon Closing. This
Agreement may be amended, superseded or canceled only by a written instrument
duly executed by the Parties. Any of the terms of this Agreement and any
condition to a Party's obligations hereunder may be waived only in a signed
writing by that Party specifically stating that it waives a term or condition
hereof. No waiver by either Party of any one or more conditions or defaults by
the other in performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall
operate or be construed as a waiver of any future conditions or defaults,
whether of a like or different character, nor shall the waiver constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

9.6 Severability. Each portion of this Agreement is intended to be severable.
If any term or provision hereof is illegal or invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the
remainder of this Agreement.

9.7 Counterparts; Electronic Delivery. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Any counterpart signature page that is delivered via facsimile,
electronic mail or other electronic means shall have the same force and effect
as an original counterpart signature page.

9.8 Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.

(d) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, enforced in accordance
with, and interpreted under, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
reference to conflicts of Laws principles.

(e) Negotiation. In the event of any dispute, the Parties shall promptly seek
to resolve any such dispute by negotiations between senior executives of the
Parties who have authority to settle the dispute. When a Party believes there
is a dispute under this Agreement that Party will promptly give the other
Party written notice of the dispute. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of
such notice, the receiving Party shall submit to the other a written response.
Both the notice and response shall include (i) a statement of each Party's
position and a summary of the evidence and



arguments supporting such position, and (ii) the name, title, fax number, and
telephone number of the executive or executives who will represent that Party.
If the dispute involves a Claim arising out of the actions of any Person not a
signatory to this Agreement, the receiving Party shall have such additional
time as necessary, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, to
investigate the dispute before submitting a written response. The executives
shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place within fifteen (15) days
after the date of the response and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem
necessary to exchange relevant information and to attempt to resolve the
dispute.

(f) Failure to Resolve. If the dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60)
days after the date of the response given pursuant to Section 9.8(b) above, or
such additional time, if any, that the Parties mutually agree to in writing,
or if the Party receiving such notice denies the applicability of the
provisions of Section 9.8(b) or otherwise refuses to participate under the
provisions of Section 9.8(b), either Party may initiate legal proceedings to
enforce its rights under this Agreement.

(g) The provisions of Sections 9.8(b) and 9.8(c) shall not apply to disputes
governed by Sections 2.3 through 2.5 or ARTICLE VI.

DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND,
THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
