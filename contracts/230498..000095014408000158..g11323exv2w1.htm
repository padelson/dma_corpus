included in the Closing Statement or in the notice of disagreement. The Accounting Referee shall
consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and Buyer&#146;s calculations of items
therein as to which Stockholders&#146; Representative has disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall
deliver to Stockholders&#146; Representative and Buyer, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no
later than fifteen (15)&nbsp;days from the date it receives the last rebuttal statement), a report
setting forth its determination. Such report shall be final and binding upon Stockholders&#146;
Representative and Buyer. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be paid by Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the other hand, in proportion to where the Accounting
Referee&#146;s position falls between the respective positions of Buyer and the Stockholders&#146; Representative
(and any amounts payable by the Stockholders shall be paid on a pro rata basis based on the
Proportionate Interest of each Stockholder).

would materially impair the value of the real property (based on non-residential
