The Preliminary Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of this Section 1.18. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall pay in full, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to pay in full, all Debt that, pursuant to _Schedule 2.5B_, is to be paid in full at or prior to Closing. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to the Stockholders Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") that will set forth: 

    

 (i) a consolidating and consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the Measurement Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "); 

   

 (ii) a calculation of Company Net Debt as calculated from the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Actual Company Net Debt_ "); and 

   

 (iii) the actual Net Working Capital of the Company as of the Measurement Time (the " _Actual Net Working Capital_ "). 

  

 (c) The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Companys balance sheet at December 30, 2006, June 16, 2007 and September 8, 2007 and shall fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of the Closing. " _Net Working Capital_ " shall mean specified current assets minus specified current liabilities determined in the manner set forth on  _Schedule 1.18_ hereto, which _Schedule 1.18_ specifies the line items from the Closing Balance Sheet to be used in the calculation of Net Working Capital. The amount of such line items shall be determined using accounting principles and methodologies consistent with those used to prepare the " _Target Net Working Capital_ " (in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Companys balance sheet at December 30, 2006, June 16, 2007 and September 8, 2007) as set forth on _Schedule 1.18_. The Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculations therein and in the conduct of the review (including any review by the Accounting Referee) referred to in this Section 1.18, including by making available, to the extent necessary, books, records, work papers and 

   ##### 

  

   

personnel. To the extent that the (i) amount of the actual Transaction
Expenses paid after the Measurement Time by the Company do not equal the
amounts allocated to such items in calculating the Merger Consideration at
Closing or (ii) amount of the actual payments required to be paid by SPLLC to
fund the SPLLC JV Buyout Distributions does not equal the amount of Cash
specified by the Company at Closing as the SPLLC JV Buyout Distributions (and
which is therefore excluded from the calculation of Net Working Capital
pursuant to _Schedule 1.18_), adjustments for such differences shall be
reflected in the Actual Net Working Capital. 

   

 (d) If the Stockholders Representative disagrees with the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 1.18(b), the Stockholders Representative may, within forty-five (45) days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with all or any portion of the calculation of Actual Company Net Debt or Actual Net Working Capital and setting forth in detail the basis for Stockholders Representatives disagreement with any calculation items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Stockholders Representative disagrees, and Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to have agreed to all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement and the calculations therein. 

   

 (e) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section 1.18(d), Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall, during the thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement. If during such period, Stockholders Representative and Buyer are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause BDO Seidman, LLP (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") to review the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Actual Company Net Debt and Actual Net Working Capital (it being understood that in making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). Stockholders Representative and Buyer shall each be entitled to present one written statement of position with respect to the matters in dispute within twenty (20) days of the engagement of the Accounting Referee (with copies to be provided to the other party) and, no later than the twentieth (20th) day following receipt thereof, one rebuttal statement with respect to the statement of position delivered by the other party; _provided_ , that neither Stockholders Representative nor Buyer shall be allowed to present additional adjustments or introduce new matters to the Accounting Referee that were not included in the original Closing Statement or the notice of disagreement delivered pursuant to Section 1.18(d), except to the extent such additional adjustments or matters are related to matters included in the Closing Statement or in the notice of disagreement. The Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement and Buyers calculations of items therein as to which Stockholders Representative has disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Stockholders Representative and Buyer, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than fifteen (15) days from the date it receives the last rebuttal statement), a report setting forth its determination. Such report shall be final and binding upon Stockholders Representative and Buyer. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the other hand, in proportion to where the Accounting Referees position falls between the respective positions of Buyer and the Stockholders Representative (and any amounts payable by the Stockholders shall be paid on a pro rata basis based on the Proportionate Interest of each Stockholder). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (f) The " _Company Debt Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, shall equal Actual Company Debt _minus_ Estimated Company Net Debt. The " _Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative, shall equal Actual Net Working Capital  _minus_ Target Net Working Capital. If the Working Capital Adjustment Amount _minus_  the Company Debt Adjustment Amount is a positive number, Buyer shall pay or cause the Company to pay to the CSE Holders their respective Proportionate Interests in the entire amount of such difference, and the Working Capital Escrow Agent shall release to the CSE Holders their respective Proportionate Interests in all amounts held in the Working Capital Escrow Account. If the Working Capital Adjustment Amount _minus_ the Company Debt Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the entire amount of such difference shall be delivered to the Buyer from the Working Capital Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Working Capital Escrow Agreement and the balance, if any, in the Working Capital Escrow Account shall be released by the Working Capital Escrow Agent to the CSE Holders, such balance to be distributed to the CSE Holders based on their respective Proportionate Interests. In the event that such difference is greater than the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the CSE Holders, severally in accordance with their respective Proportionate Interests, shall pay to Buyer the amount of any such shortfall. 

   

 (g) Any payment pursuant to this Section 1.18 shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Statement has been finally and conclusively determined by wire transfer by the Buyer, the Company, the Working Capital Escrow Agent or the CSE Holders, as the case may be, of immediately available funds to the account of such other party as may be designated in writing by Buyer, the Company or the Working Capital Escrow Agent or by the Stockholders Representative acting on behalf of the CSE Holders. For the avoidance of doubt, any and all payments under this Section 1.18 shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes.

letter executed in connection with the Financing (" _Flex_ ")), and there
are no conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing not

(iii) resolve any such objections. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required to agree to any prohibition,

 5.3 _Employee Benefit Matters_  

  

 (a) Except as generally described on _Schedule 5.3_, Buyer agrees that individuals who are employed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain employees of the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries upon the Effective Time (each such employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ "). 

   

 (b) With respect to any Plan that is a defined contribution plan and intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, if Buyer reasonably determines that, as of the Closing, there was any material error or omission in the operation of such Plan or other circumstance that could reasonably result in the loss of the Plans tax qualification (a " _Qualification Defect_ "), then Buyer and the Company shall take reasonable action to correct the Qualification Defect, which may include action under the Internal Revenue Service Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (" _EPCRS_ ") or any successor correction program. Prior to 

    ##### 

  

    

effecting any such correction as to which Buyer Indemnified Parties shall seek
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.1(j), Buyer shall provide written
notice to the Stockholders Representative, together with an explanation
of the Qualification Defect and a description of the proposed correction, and
shall not take any material action with respect to the design or effectuation
of the correction without obtaining the Stockholders Representatives prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 (c) With respect to each employee benefit plan of Buyer, or any Affiliate of such Person (" _Buyer Plan_ "), in which Continuing Employees subsequently participate, for purposes of determining vesting and eligibility for benefits, and for severance benefits and vacation only, for purposes of benefit accrual, service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers thereof to the extent the plans of the Company provide past service credit) shall be treated as service with the Person providing such Buyer Plan; _provided_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Such service also shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing condition limitations. Each Buyer Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived under the applicable Plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Continuing Employees shall be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries during the plan year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of Buyer Plan for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. 

  

 (d) Subject to the modification of existing employment agreements as contemplated by Section 6.2(g), the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees to assume and perform the obligations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries under each employment agreement with any current employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall be deemed to be a commitment of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to employ any Continuing Employee for any period of time after the Effective Time, and this Section 5.3 shall not be construed to limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time after the Effective Time, subject to the terms of any employment agreement with such Continuing Employee. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or any successor thereto or affiliate thereof), to pay the Kasun Amount and the van der Kloet Amount when due and payable pursuant to the terms thereof. 

  

 (e) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall create any third party beneficiary right in any Person other than the Parties, including any current or former Continuing Employee, any participant in any Plan or Buyer Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right to continued employment with the Surviving Corporation, Buyer, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall constitute an amendment to any Plan, Buyer Plan or any other plan or arrangement covering Continuing Employees. The Company and Buyer shall each cooperate with the other and shall provide to the other such documentation, information and assistance as is reasonably necessary to effect the provisions of this Section 5.3. 

   #####

 5.5 _Public Announcements_  

  

 Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer or Merger Sub on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, issue or cause the publication of any other press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby without the consent of the other, except (i) where such release or announcement is required by applicable Law or regulatory requirement (including rules promulgated under the Exchange Act) and/or the New York Stock Exchange, provided that the Party required to make such release or announcement shall, when practicable, so advise the other Party in advance of such release or announcement and shall provide the other Party the reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or announcement and (ii) Buyer shall be permitted to issue a press release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, regarding the execution of this Agreement and shall be entitled to make reference to this Agreement (and to file a copy of this Agreement) in its periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act. 

     ##### 

 

   

 5.6 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_  

  

 The officers, directors and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have such rights to indemnification as are provided for pursuant to the applicable Organizational Documents or other agreements as are in existence and effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to all matters giving rise to indemnification that occurs prior to the Effective Time. This Agreement, however, does not impose any restriction upon the Companys or any Subsidiarys right to modify such indemnification rights with respect to matters arising subsequent to the Effective Time. 

  

 5.7 _Transaction Expenses; New York Transfer Taxes_  

  

 (a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Buyer a true and complete written report setting forth an itemized list of any and all Transaction Expenses incurred or otherwise payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby which, in each case, have not been or will not be paid as of the Closing Date, together with invoices or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer from Persons to whom such Transaction Expenses are or will be owed (the " _Transaction Expense Statement_ "). Expenses set forth in the Transaction Expense Statement shall be paid promptly following the Closing by the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) The Parties agree that (i) the value of the real property or interest therein of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is located in New York to be reported on the respective Transfer Tax filings related thereto (Forms TP-584) to be filed by Buyer and the Stockholders shall be in the total amount of $78,942,000, which shall be allocated to the respective New York real properties or interests therein as set forth on _Schedule 5.7(b)_, and (ii) the total Transfer Tax in the amount of $315,768 reported on and due pursuant to such filings shall constitute Transaction Expenses. The Parties further agree to mutually cooperate in preparing and having executed at the Closing all such Transfer Tax filings as required by applicable Law consistent with the value allocations set forth on _Schedule 5.7(b)_. 

   

 5.8 _Assistance with Financing_  

  

 (a) The Company shall provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, reasonable cooperation that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with Buyers arrangement of the Financing as contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any alternative financing in connection with the transactions contemplated by Section 3.7 as may be reasonably requested by Buyer ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing Business of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, cause the breach of any agreement to which the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates is a party or involve any binding commitment by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates), including using reasonable commercial efforts to assist Buyer with:

 (iv) the preparation by Buyer of an offering memorandum or private placement memorandum suitable for use in a customary "road show" for an offering of high-yield debt securities by the Buyer and the participation of the senior management of the Company and its Subsidiaries and representatives with Buyer in any such road show; and 

   

 (v) the rating agency process. 

 

Nothing in this Section 5.8(a) shall be construed as requiring the Company or
its Subsidiaries to prepare financial statements other than the Company
Financial Statements. Buyer shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket fees
and expenses related to the Financing contemplated hereby. Accordingly,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.7 hereof, Buyer shall
reimburse the CSE Holders, including by way of payment of Transaction
Expenses in accordance with Section 1.9, for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in

Buyer also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective Affiliates and each of their representatives, from and against any and all Liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith. 

   

 5.9 _Tax Matters_

At least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the filing date, Buyer shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative a copy of any such Return if any CSE Holder would be responsible for the Taxes shown on the Return (including pursuant to an indemnification obligation hereunder) or for the Taxes resulting from transactions reported on the Return. If the Stockholders Representative disagrees with any aspect of the Return, the Stockholders Representative shall deliver a written notice to Buyer setting forth in reasonable detail the 

  ##### 

  

    

grounds for its disagreement, and such disagreement shall be resolved using
the same procedures as provided in Section 1.18(e). 

   

 (b) The Stockholders Representative and Buyer (and its Affiliates) shall reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include, in the case of Buyer, maintaining and making available to the Stockholders Representative all relevant records relating to Taxes and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of any material provided pursuant to this Section 5.9, to testify at any proceedings relating to Taxes and to execute any Returns. Buyer shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date until the applicable statute of limitations (including any extensions) has expired; (ii) abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority; and (iii) allow the Stockholders Representative, at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records as the Stockholders Representative may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal business hours at the Stockholders Representatives expense. 

   

 (c) In the event a Governmental Authority makes any claim (i) relating to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date or (ii) for which any CSE Holder might be liable under this Agreement, Buyer or the Company shall promptly, following receipt of such Tax claim, give written notice of such claim to the Stockholders Representative, together with copies of all notices and communications relating to such claim. 

   

 (d) The Stockholders Representative shall have the right to control all proceedings at the Stockholders Representatives expense and may make all decisions with respect to any Tax claim relating to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or if such proceeding could result in an indemnification obligation by a CSE Holder under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the terms of such settlement would have any material adverse impact on the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer (including any material increase in any indemnification payment or other Liability for which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer is responsible) after taking into account any indemnification payment that Buyer is entitled to receive from the CSE Holders under this Agreement, then the Stockholders Representative shall not settle or compromise such claim without Buyers consent, not to be unreasonably delayed or withheld. 

   

 (e) Buyer and its Affiliates may not amend any income Return of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date, or any other Return of the Company and its Subsidiaries if such amendment could increase (including pursuant to this Agreement) the Liability of any CSE Holder, in each case, without the prior written consent of the Stockholders Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

 (f) If Buyer so elects and provides notice thereof to the Stockholders no later than November 15, 2008 (or such earlier date as is required by Law), each of the Parties shall 

    ##### 

  

    

take all steps necessary to make a timely, effective and irrevocable election
pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and, if permissible, under
comparable provisions of any applicable state Tax Laws) with respect to the
acquisition by Buyer of the Company Common Stock to treat such purchase and
sale as a deemed sale of Assets for federal income Tax and applicable state
income Tax purposes (collectively, the " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_"),
and in connection therewith: 

    

 (i) Buyer, the Stockholders and their respective Affiliates shall report the transactions consistently with the Allocation and the Section 338(h)(10) Election; 

   

 (ii) at the Closing, the Stockholders shall execute and deliver to Buyer any and all forms necessary to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Election (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and any similar forms under applicable state income Tax Laws) (collectively, the " _Section 338 Forms_"); and 

   

 (iii) Buyer, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the other hand, each agree not to take any action to revoke the Section 338(h)(10) Election following the filing of the Section 338 Forms without the consent of the other unless required to do so pursuant to a final determination by any Governmental Authority. 

 

Buyer shall not file with any Governmental Authority any Tax form, statement
or election with respect to the Section 338(h)(10) Election unless and until
Buyer provides notice of such election to the Stockholders and makes all
payments required by Section 1.19(b). 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall pay and shall indemnify and hold harmless the CSE Holders for all Buyer Transfer Taxes. 

   

 (h) For purposes of calculating the Tax liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any period including but not ending on the Closing Date, the portion of any Tax that is allocable to the taxable period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date will be: (i) in the case of Taxes other than income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period, and (ii) in the case of income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, determined from the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as though the taxable year of the Company and its Subsidiaries terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date. 

   

 (i) Any Tax refunds or amounts credited against Taxes in lieu of such Tax refunds that are received by Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date or for which any CSE Holder is or was responsible or liable (including pursuant to this Agreement) (other than any such refund or credit taken into account in determining Actual Net Working Capital) shall be for the account of the CSE Holders, and Buyer shall pay over to the CSE Holders directly, in accordance with their respective Proportionate Interests, any such 

    ##### 

  

    

Tax refund or the amount of any such credit within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof or entitlement thereto.

 (b) _Injunctive Relief_. Any remedy at law for any breach of the provisions contained in this Section 5.10 shall be inadequate and Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to any other remedy Buyer might have hereunder.

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Company agrees to provide Buyer and its auditors sufficient access to the Companys information and personnel to obtain all of the information they reasonably require to obtain (if available) or develop historical and/or proforma financial information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries so long as doing so does not interfere with the preparation and delivery of the financial information as contemplated in Section 5.12(c) below.

 5.13 _Obligations of Affiliates_  

  

 Except as contemplated in this Agreement (including in the Company Disclosure Schedule), on or before the Closing Date, the Stockholders shall terminate any ongoing agreements between any of them or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, all without any expense to the Company (or any reduction in the gross Assets reflected on the Company Balance Sheet) so that following the Closing Date neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligations of any kind or nature to the Stockholders or their Affiliates except for those specified in this Agreement and the other documents being executed in connection herewith, and all debts and other obligations owed or required to be performed by the Stockholders or their Affiliates to the Company shall be paid or discharged in full.

 Effective as of the Closing, each CSE Holder hereby releases and forever discharges the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, from any and all rights, claims, demands, judgments, obligations, Liabilities and damages, whether accrued or unaccrued, asserted or unasserted, fixed or contingent, and whether known or unknown relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including, with respect to Hill, his rights to additional payments pursuant to the Hill SPA), which ever existed or now exists, by any reason whatsoever, relating to any fact, situation, circumstance, status, event, act, failure to act, or transaction occurring on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that, nothing contained in this Section 5.14 shall be deemed to release the Company or Buyer or any of its Affiliates from any of their respective obligations under this Agreement, the Working Capital Escrow Agreement, the Employment Agreements or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. 

  

 5.15 _The Company to Cure Title Defects and Facilitate Buyer Title Insurance_  

  

 (a) Buyer has reviewed the preliminary surveys and title commitments for certain of the Owned Real Property, as set forth on _Schedule 5.15(a)(1)_ and except for the items identified on  _Schedule 5.15(a)(2)_ with respect to such Owned Real Property, Buyer finds title to such Owned Real Property acceptable to Buyer. The Company acknowledges that Buyer is entering into this Agreement prior to completion of Buyers due diligence with respect to title to the remainder of the Owned Real Property not listed on _Schedule 5.15(a)(1)_. Accordingly, the Company covenants and agrees that on or before Closing (i) the Company will pay and cause to be released all Liens on Owned Real Property that are either (A) identified by Buyer on _Schedule 5.15(a)(2)_ as having unacceptable title defects or (B) otherwise are part of the remainder of the Owned Real Property not listed on _Schedule 5.15(a)(1)_ and that are, in each case, judgments, liens or encumbrances in liquidated amounts, other than the Permitted Liens, of which Buyer notifies the Company following Buyers completion of its due diligence, and (ii) with respect to all other Liens on Owned Real Property identified other than those referenced under the 

    ##### 

  

    

foregoing clause (i) of this Section 5.15(a) or Permitted Liens, the Company
will use (and will cause its Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy and cure (A) those matters described on _Schedule
5.15(a)(2)_ as having unacceptable title defects or (B) any such other
objectionable matters revealed by Buyers title and survey due diligence of
the Owned Real Property not listed on _Schedule 5.15(a)(1)_ which Buyer
acting in a commercially reasonable fashion finds to be objectionable and
that are not otherwise Permitted Liens and of which Buyer notifies the
Company promptly following Buyers identification of the issue.
The identification of Liens and title defects as a result of Buyers
diligence shall not have the effect of modifying or diminishing the Companys
title representations and warranties, except to the extent such Liens and
title defects are eliminated prior to Closing. 

   

 (b) The Company shall cooperate with and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in Buyers efforts to obtain title insurance policies on the Owned Real Property at Closing, including delivering an owners affidavit and such other documents as Buyers title company shall reasonably require, to enable such title company to delete the standard exceptions from such title policies and to issue such policies with such endorsements as Buyer or its lender shall reasonably require. 

   

 5.16 _ISRA Covenants_  

  

 (a) Conduct of ISRA Proceedings. 

    

 (i) Prior to or after the Closing, with respect to the New Jersey Property, the Company or the CSE Holders shall, at the sole cost and expense of the Company, if prior to the Measurement Time, or at the sole cost and expense of the CSE Holders, if after the Measurement Time, achieve Compliance with ISRA consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including giving the appropriate notice of this transaction as and when required to NJDEP, paying applicable fees and oversight costs to NJDEP, and, if required by NJDEP, posting of financial assurance or a remediation funding source. 

   

 (ii) Prior to the Closing Date, with respect to the New Jersey Property and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall: (A) achieve Compliance with ISRA; or (B) obtain from NJDEP and execute a Remediation Agreement (as such term is defined under ISRA) permitting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in which case the CSE Holders (and not the Company) shall prepare and file all documents required by NJDEP to obtain the Remediation Agreement (" _RA_ "), and the CSE Holders shall be the ordered parties on the RA. 

   

 (iii) If Compliance with ISRA cannot be achieved prior to Closing, the CSE Holders shall, after the Closing, make all filings and take all actions, including Remedial Actions, necessary to achieve Compliance with ISRA. As reasonably requested by the CSE Holders, Buyer and the Company agree to promptly execute such documents prepared by the CSE Holders in connection with the CSE Holders efforts to achieve Compliance with ISRA provided that the form and content of such documents are reasonably satisfactory to the Company. 

   ##### 

  

    

After the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to cooperate with the CSE
Holders in the conduct of any required Remedial Actions, including the
execution of any required documents and the granting of reasonable access to
the New Jersey Property to the CSE Holders and their respective consultants,
agents or representatives pursuant to the terms hereof. The CSE Holders shall
not be deemed to be in default of this Section 5.16 if Buyer or, after the
Closing, the Company are in breach of their obligations under this provision
to the extent that Buyer or Companys breach is the cause of the CSE Holders
breach. 

   

 (iv) The Stockholders Representative shall promptly provide Buyer with copies of all documents including correspondence, directives, reports, applications, proposals and recommendations submitted by or on behalf of the CSE Holders to, or received by the CSE Holders from, NJDEP in connection with the CSE Holders actions to achieve Compliance with ISRA. The CSE Holders shall provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity of not less than seven (7) Business Days prior to their anticipated submission to the NJDEP (if feasible and no violation of Environmental Law would occur due to the delay), to review and comment upon drafts of all documents to be submitted by or on behalf of the CSE Holders to the NJDEP in connection with its obligations under ISRA or its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.16, and the Stockholders Representative shall make a good faith effort to incorporate Buyers reasonable, substantive comments into the documents prior to their submission by Stockholders Representative to the NJDEP to the extent that such comments are supportable by and in compliance with the Technical Requirements for Site Remediation, N.J.A.C. 7:26B-1 et seq. as the same may be amended (the " _Tech. Regs._ "). The Stockholders Representative shall promptly provide Buyer with written notice (at least five (5) Business Days in advance, if feasible and no violation of Environmental Law would occur due to the delay) prior to meeting with any NJDEP representatives, and the CSE Holders shall afford a representative of Buyer the opportunity to be present and observe at any meetings with the NJDEP. 

  

 (b) _Performance of Remedial Actions_. As to any Remedial Actions that the CSE Holders are required or permitted to perform at the New Jersey Property pursuant to Section 5.16(a), the CSE Holders agree to: 

    

 (i) perform and cause all consultants and contractors retained by on the CSE Holders behalf, to perform all such Remedial Actions in a workmanlike manner and consistent with all applicable Environmental Laws; 

   

 (ii) comply with all Environmental Laws applicable to the implementation of such Remedial Actions at the New Jersey Property, including obligations to obtain all permits, authorizations and consents required under applicable Environmental Laws or by NJDEP or other governmental agency or authority in order to implement such Remedial Actions at the New Jersey Property; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) implement such Remedial Actions in such manner, at such times and with such advance notice as to not cause a default or breach of any of the terms or conditions of any of the Leases; and 

   

 (iv) cause all consultants and contractors performing such Remedial Actions to provide and maintain comprehensive general liability insurance, automobile liability insurance, workers compensation and employers liability insurance and professional liability insurance (each policy naming Buyer, Company and Subsidiaries as additional insureds) in full force and effect with limits of coverage that are customary for the performance of comparable work or services until the completion of the Remedial Actions. 

  

 (c) _Engineering/Institutional Controls_. 

    

 (i) The Company and CSE Holders intend to seek an ISRA Remediation in Progress Waiver from NJDEP for the leased property at 2013 McCarter Highway, Newark, New Jersey (the " _Newark Property_ ") which is presently the subject of a pending ISRA case being conducted by LandA Associates, the property owner as a result of a prior transaction. Buyer acknowledges that LandA Associates may propose to implement Engineering or Institutional Controls at the Newark Property as part of its pending ISRA case and that Buyers and the Companys rights with respect to such Engineering or Institutional Controls are subject to the Lease and other existing agreements and are not governed by this Section 5.16. 

   

 (ii) To the extent that Remedial Action is required to achieve Compliance with ISRA, the CSE Holders shall use commercially reasonable efforts (which, in each instance, shall include consideration of cost-effectiveness among other factors) to remediate the New Jersey Property to a non-residential use standard and to secure from NJDEP, as promptly as commercially reasonable, a No Further Action Letter for the New Jersey Property (an " _NFA Letter_ ") which NFA Letter may be conditioned on the imposition of Engineering or Institutional Controls (as such terms are defined in ISRA) on the New Jersey Property, including filing of a Deed Notice (as defined in ISRA) restricting the use of the New Jersey Property to non-residential uses or the maintenance of existing structures or foundations, provided, however that all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) Buyer has had the opportunity to make the election to require the CSE Holders to obtain the NFA Letter without the use of the NFA Conditions (as hereinafter defined) pursuant to subsection (iv) hereof; (2) if the New Jersey Property is not owned by the Company, that the terms of the lease permit the use of the NFA Conditions; and (3) Buyer or the Companys prior written consent must be obtained if the NFA Letter is conditioned upon any Engineering or Institutional Control that would require the construction of new structures (including caps or covers over portions of the real property) that would materially impair the value of the real property (based on non-residential use) or that would materially interfere with the conduct of the Companys Business. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) If the CSE Holders determine that it is commercially reasonable to secure an NFA Letter from NJDEP that is conditioned on the use of Engineering and/or Institutional Controls, the Stockholders Representative shall, as promptly as is practicable, provide Buyer with written notice thereof and a reasonably detailed summary setting forth the conditions proposed by the NJDEP (the " _NFA Conditions_ ") and a written, detailed and reasonable good faith cost estimate for the incremental cost to remediate the New Jersey Property to such standards as will enable the CSE Holders to secure an unconditioned NFA Letter. In the event Buyer advises the Stockholders Representative that certain, but not all of the proposed NFA Conditions would be acceptable, then the Stockholders Representative shall provide a revised good faith cost estimate for the costs to remediate the New Jersey Property to the conditions deemed acceptable by Buyer. 

   

 (iv) Buyer shall then have ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the notice referred to in Section 5.16(c)(iii) to notify the Stockholders Representative in writing that, subject to the incorporation of Buyers comments thereto and the conditions set forth in Section 5.16(c)(v) below, Buyer (A) has elected to accept the NFA Conditions or (B) is willing to pay such amount as reflects the actual incremental costs in excess of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) incurred by or on behalf of the CSE Holders to remediate the New Jersey Property or any portion thereof to an unrestricted standard (the " _Incremental Costs_ ") or (C) disputes that the CSE Holders determination pursuant to paragraph (iii) above was commercially reasonable. If Buyer disputes the commercial reasonableness of CSE Holders determination pursuant to paragraph (iii) above, Buyer and the CSE Holders shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on whether the CSE Holders determination was commercially reasonable. If agreement through good faith negotiation cannot be reached within twenty (20) days of Buyers written notice, the Parties shall resolve the dispute through binding arbitration which shall proceed on an expedited basis using the rules and procedures specified by the arbitrator. The Parties will cooperate to select an arbitrator from a list provided by the American Arbitration Association. If the Parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, an arbitrator who is qualified to adjudicate environmental matters shall be chosen by the American Arbitration Association. Each Party shall bear its own costs of the arbitration processes, except that costs of the American Arbitration Association and the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the Parties. 

   

 (v) If Buyer elects to pay the Incremental Costs pursuant to Section 5.16(c)(iv), then the CSE Holders shall remediate the New Jersey Property or any portion thereof and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and provide to Buyer the unconditioned NFA from the NJDEP as promptly as practicable or, as the case may be, the NFA letter with those NFA Conditions which Buyer deemed acceptable in writing. Within forty-five (45) days of Buyers receipt of each detailed invoice from the Stockholders Representative, Buyer shall reimburse the CSE Holders for the actual Incremental Costs. 

   

 (vi) If Buyer accepts the NFA Conditions in accordance with Section 5.16(c)(iv), then (A) the CSE Holders shall be responsible at their sole cost and 

   ##### 

  

    

expense for the maintenance of any Classification Exception Area or Well
Restriction Area which is imposed pursuant to the NFA Conditions, including
the installation, maintenance, repair and/or sampling of groundwater
monitoring wells or groundwater treatment facilities at the New Jersey
Property required by the NFA Conditions and any further reporting,
investigatory or remedial activities required by NJDEP in connection
therewith until the termination of the Classification Exception Area or Well
Restriction Area, and (B) the CSE Holders shall either pay, or provide
a funding mechanism to pay, to Buyer an agreed upon sum equal to the net
present value (assuming a 7% discount rate) of thirty (30) times the amount
mutually agreed to be a commercially reasonable estimate of the annual cost
to inspect, maintain and repair the NFA Conditions or make other reasonable
arrangements (such as the purchase of insurance) as are reasonably acceptable
to Buyer to guarantee the annual payment of such costs (which may include a
multiplier less than 30 if the NFA conditions terminate earlier) and,
thereafter, Buyer shall be responsible at its sole cost and expense for the
obligations arising from the NFA Conditions with respect to maintenance,
repair, inspection and certification requirements. 

  

 (d) _Post-Closing Access for ISRA and the CSE Holders_. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company (post-Closing) to, afford the CSE Holders access to the New Jersey Property after the Closing for the purposes of implementing and/or completing the CSE Holders obligations under ISRA and the Remedial Actions. The CSE Holders shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any adverse impact the performance of the Remedial Actions may have on the Companys or Buyers operation of the Business or use of the New Jersey Property. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate the CSE Holders performance of the Remedial Actions. All wastes generated by the CSE Holders during the Remedial Actions (including any soil, purged groundwater and sample residuals) shall be the sole responsibility of the CSE Holders and the CSE Holders shall promptly dispose of such wastes upon completion of any phase of the Remedial Actions at their sole expense and cost in accordance with all applicable Environmental Laws, including the CSE Holders signing of any Hazardous Waste Manifests or other manifests, shipping and disposal documents as necessary. Following completion of any phase of Remedial Actions at the New Jersey Property, the CSE Holders shall at their own expense restore the New Jersey Property to a substantially similar condition and state as it was in immediately prior to the commencement of such Remedial Actions, which restoration shall include closing the monitoring well(s) in accordance with all applicable regulations and repairing any damage or disturbance to the New Jersey Property caused by the Remedial Actions. 

   

 (e) _Groundwater Treatment and Monitoring, Operation and Maintenance Activities, Acceptable Restrictions_. Following the Closing, upon the written approval of the Company, the CSE Holders shall have the right to install and maintain equipment and facilities necessary for performing the Remedial Actions (including such treatment facilities, underground piping and wells as are necessary or useful to monitor, recover and treat groundwater beneath or emanating from the New Jersey Property). The Company shall not unreasonably withhold, delay, deny or condition its approval, it being acknowledged and agreed that it is unreasonable to condition an approval upon or require the placement of any such equipment or facilities in a location that is not acceptable to NJDEP. The CSE Holders agree, promptly following written 

    ##### 

  

    

request by the Company, to relocate such equipment and/or facilities to non-
objectionable locations and, if the original locations of such equipment
and/or facilities were approved in writing by Buyer, then the cost of
relocation shall be borne by Buyer, otherwise the costs shall be borne by the
CSE Holders. 

   

 (f) _Post-Closing Default_. In the event that NJDEP issues a letter or notice of violation (collectively, the " _NOV_ ") with respect to the CSE Holders Remedial Actions after Closing indicating that the Remedial Actions are not being performed in accordance with the requirements of Environmental Law (including the Tech. Regs.), the Stockholders Representative shall provide a copy of such NOV to Buyer and the CSE Holders will promptly undertake to cure the alleged violation(s) set forth in the NOV. If the CSE Holders either (i) fail or refuse to cure the violation(s) within thirty (30) days after receipt of the NOV or (ii) in the event such violation(s) cannot be cured within said thirty (30) day period if the CSE Holders have not commenced reasonable actions to cure the alleged violation(s) within said thirty (30) day period and are not diligently completing such actions, then Buyer shall have the right but not the obligation to undertake any and all actions it deems appropriate to cure the alleged violation(s) noted in the NOV; provided that any Remedial Actions conducted by Buyer must be in accordance with Environmental Laws (including the Tech. Regs.) and in a commercially reasonable manner (which shall include consideration of cost effectiveness among other factors). Buyer shall be entitled to reimbursement of all damages arising from the CSE Holders breach of their obligation to comply with ISRA in accordance with the provisions hereof and in accordance with all Environmental Laws, including reasonable attorneys fees. The CSE Holders shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this provision if they have sought in a timely manner and in good faith to challenge such NOV and are diligently pursuing such challenge in accordance with the administrative procedures and deadlines established by the State or NJDEP to challenge such notices. 

   

 (g) _Survival_. The provisions of this Section 5.16 shall survive the Closing until such time as Compliance with ISRA is achieved. 

   

 (h) _Obligations of CSE Holders_. The obligations of the CSE Holders under this Section 5.16 shall be several and not joint. The Stockholders Representative shall have the right, but not the obligation, to control, on behalf of the CSE Holders and at their sole expense, any actions required to be taken by the CSE Holders under this Section 5.16. 

   

 5.17 _CSE Holder s Covenant to Maintain Net Worth_ 

  

 For a period ending five (5) years after the Effective Time, each of Steven Grossman, Robert Grossman and Hill will at all times keep and maintain a Net Worth equal to the product of (i) $200,000,000 multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Merger Consideration to which such individual is entitled and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate of the Merger Consideration to which all of such individuals are entitled. " _Net Worth_ " means, as of the date of any determination thereof, the amount by which such individuals Assets exceed such individuals Liabilities. For a period ending five (5) years after the Effective Time, within forty-five (45) days after the end of each year, each such individual shall deliver to Buyer a certificate, upon Buyers written request, certifying that such individual is in compliance with the covenants of this Section 5.17. 

   ##### 

  

  

 5.18 _Environmental Insurance Covenant_  

  

 (a) The Company and the CSE Holders have obtained a bindable quote from the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies to provide insurance coverage for the Company, its Subsidiaries, the CSE Holders, Buyer, Merger Sub and Rock-Tenn Services Inc. for Liabilities and Damages arising out of Environmental Conditions that may exist at the time of Closing at the Assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Leased Real Property (the " _Chubb Quote_ "). A copy of the Chubb Quote is attached as _Exhibit C_ to this Agreement. Prior to Closing, the Company and the CSE Holders shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such insurance to become effective as of the Closing (i.e., to "bind" the policy) substantially on the terms described in _Exhibit C_, including the CSE Holders paying the policy premium and satisfying any conditions contained in the Chubb Quote that remain outstanding. If the Company and the CSE Holders are unable to cause the insurance to become effective as of the Closing, then the CSE Holders shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the insurance as soon as possible after the Closing. The coverage term shall be five (5) years unless, prior to binding, Buyer has paid any additional premium incurred, and taken any other action required, to extend the term to ten (10) years, in which case CSE Holders shall request that the Policy be issued with a ten (10) year term. 

   

 (b) Upon issuance of the coverage (the " _Policy_ "), Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to take all reasonable actions to comply with the terms and conditions of the Policy and to seek to maximize the potential coverage under the Policy for any Liabilities or Damages arising under Environmental Law. Such actions shall include the provision of prompt notice of claims to the insurer, cooperation with the insurers investigation, defense or settlement of any claims, and compliance with existing institutional and engineering controls. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the generality of the preceding Section 5.18(b), the Company and its Subsidiaries, agree to: 

    

 (i) provide the Stockholders Representative with at least fifteen (15) Business Days to review and comment on any amendment or endorsement that the Company proposes to make to the Policy that could be adverse to the interests of the CSE Holders. The application for any such amendment or endorsement must first be approved in writing by the Stockholders Representative; 

   

 (ii) not assign or transfer any or all of their rights under the Policy to any other Person, without the prior approval of the insurer and receipt of confirmation by the insurer that the Policy will remain in effect; and 

   

 (iii) provide notice to the Stockholders Representative at least ninety (90) days (or such lesser time as is feasible under the circumstances) prior to commencement of any "capital improvement" at any of the sites to which the Capital Improvement Exclusion endorsement to the Policy applies. Such notice shall provide the reasonably available and non-confidential information regarding the design and location of such capital improvement, the Companys plans for any excavation or demolition, and any additional information obtained by the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company after the Closing regarding any Environmental Conditions that may be
affected by such capital improvement. Provision of notice pursuant to this
Section 5.18(c)(iii) shall not be required if Buyer, the Company or its
Subsidiaries has already obtained an endorsement to the Policy that will
provide coverage for Damages or Liability for any Pre-Existing Environmental
Condition discovered in the course of or resulting from the capital
improvement. 

  

 (d) To the extent that Buyer Indemnified Parties fail to comply with the requirements of the Policy or the terms of this Section 5.18, any claim by the Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification under Article VII of this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount that the available coverage under the Policy has been reduced as a result of such failure to comply;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, as between the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the CSE Holders, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the provisions of this Section 5.18, retain any rights they have under Article VII, including the provisions of Section 7.3(e) and the right to indemnification with respect to any Buyer Damages that would not have been covered by the Policy in the absence of any such failure to comply.

 5.20 _Supplements to Company Disclosure Schedule_  

  

 From time to time up to the Closing, the Company shall have the right to supplement, modify or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter first existing or occurring following the date of this Agreement that (i) if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of this Agreement would have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (ii) is necessary to correct any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule that has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement, modification or amendment to any Schedule of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect on the representations and warranties of the Company given as of the date hereof, but rather shall only serve to supplement, modify or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to the representations and warranties of the Company as of the Closing Date. 

  

 5.21 _Financing_  

  

 Buyer shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts (i) to negotiate and enter into the definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter (as such terms may be altered in accordance with the Flex), (ii) to comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letter and the related fee letter and engagement letter to assist the arrangers of the Financing in accordance with the terms set forth therein (including without limitation assistance to the underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in respect of the 

   ##### 

  

    

notes offering contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the related
engagement letter (the " _Notes Offering_ ")), (iii) to satisfy (or cause its
Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer
(or its Affiliates) set forth in the Commitment Letter and such definitive
agreements and (iv) to consummate the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter at the Closing, including attempting the Notes Offering and using its
reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and any other persons providing
such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the Merger at the
Closing. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter (as such terms
may be altered in accordance with the Flex), Buyer shall promptly notify the
Stockholders Representative and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain financing for such unavailable portion of the Financing from
alternative sources, on terms that will still enable Buyer to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
acknowledged and agreed that the Financing includes a bridge facility that
will be funded in lieu of the notes to be issued in the Notes Offering to the
extent Buyer is unable to consummate the Notes Offering or issue the principal
amount of notes in the Notes Offering contemplated by the Commitment Letter,
all subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter (as the same
may be altered in accordance with the Flex). Buyer shall deliver to the
Stockholders Representative true and complete copies of all
agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide Buyer with any portion of the Financing. Buyer shall refrain (and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates to refrain)
from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably
be expected to result in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter or in any definitive agreement related to the Financing.
Buyer shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, the Commitment Letter (or
any provision of the related fee letter or engagement letter that is
incorporated by reference in any condition precedent in the Commitment
Letter) or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing that (i)
expands or adversely amends the conditions precedent to the Financing set
forth in the Commitment Letter, (ii) would reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the Closing or (iii) reduces the aggregate amount
of the Financing, in each case, without the prior written consent of the
Stockholders Representative, which may be withheld in its sole discretion.
Buyer shall keep the Stockholders Representative reasonably informed of
the status of its efforts to obtain the Financing. Buyer acknowledges that
receipt of the Financing is not a condition to Buyers obligations to effect
the Closing. Without prejudice to the rights of the Company, the Stockholders
and Hill in relation to the other Parties hereto set forth in this Agreement,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Company, the Stockholders and Hill
are not third party beneficiaries of the Commitment Letter or the definitive
documentation with respect to the Financing, and that nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to, or shall, confer upon the
Company, the Stockholders or Hill any standing as third party beneficiary of
the Commitment Letter or the definitive documentation with respect to the
Financing.

The Damages of the Stockholder Indemnified Parties described in this Section
7.2 as to which the Stockholder Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification are collectively referred to as " _Stockholder Damages_." 

   

 7.3 _Indemnification Procedure_  

  

 (a) Promptly following receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice by a third party (including any Governmental Authority) of any complaint, dispute or claim or the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment from an Indemnifying Party for any Buyer Damages or any Stockholder Damages (as the case may be), such Indemnified Party shall notify in writing Buyer or Stockholders, as the case may be (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), and provide to the Indemnifying Party: (i) a reasonably detailed description of the claim; (ii) copies of all relevant documentation relating to such claim; and (iii) the basis for indemnification, including reference to the provisions hereof under which the Indemnified Party believes it is entitled to indemnification; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give prompt notice will relieve the Indemnifying Party from such partys obligations under this Article VII only if, and only to the extent that, such failure shall have actually prejudiced the rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days thereafter to assume responsibility (subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement) for any Buyer Damages or Stockholder Damages (as the case may be) resulting from such action or proceeding, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of such audit, investigation, action or proceeding and shall employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel. In the event, however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense of the audit, investigation, action or proceeding on the terms provided above or to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in either case within such twenty (20) day period, then any Buyer Damages or 

    ##### 

  

    

any Stockholder Damages (as the case may be) shall include the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel for the Indemnified Party as incurred. In any
audit, investigation, action or proceeding for which indemnification is being
sought hereunder, the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever
is not assuming the defense of such action, shall have the right to
participate in such matter and to retain its own counsel at such partys own
expense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party (as the case may be)
shall at all times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or
Indemnified Party (as the case may be) reasonably apprised of the status of
the defense of any matter the defense of which it is maintaining, including
the status of any related insurance claim, and to cooperate in good faith with
each other with respect to the defense of any such matter. 

   

 (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume and maintain the defense of such claim pursuant to Section 7.3(a) and (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates from all Liability arising out of such claim. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder unless (x) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates from all Liability arising out of such claim, (y) does not contain any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or Liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party and (z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or term that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys Affiliates. 

   

 (c) In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant this Article VII not involving a third party claim, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party (a " _Notice of Claim_ "). Such Notice of Claim shall include: (i) a reasonably detailed description of the claim; (ii) copies of all relevant documentation relating to such claim; and (iii) the basis for indemnification, including reference to provisions hereof under which the Indemnified Party believes it is entitled to indemnification. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent any provision of this Section 7.3 conflicts with or is duplicative of any provision of Sections 1.19(c), 5.3(b) or 5.9, the provisions of Sections 1.19(c), 5.3(b) or 5.9, as applicable, shall control. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 7.3 and except as set forth in Section 5.16 dealing with ISRA matters or Section 5.18 dealing with environmental insurance, with respect to any claim for indemnification for Buyer Damages by any Buyer Indemnified Party or Parties under this Agreement related to any environmental matter, including environmental matters under Section 7.1(a), the following shall apply: 

    ##### 

  

      

 (i) Subject to the terms of this Section 7.3(e), Buyer Indemnified Parties shall solely control the timing, type and scope of response action, Remedial Action or other action to be taken to satisfy the Buyer Damages which are a subject of a claim for indemnification by Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Agreement. 

   

 (ii) Buyer Indemnified Parties, in connection with a claim for indemnification against CSE Holders under this Agreement with respect to environmental matters, shall (A) file a notice of claim with any insurance company which would reasonably be expected to provide coverage for any Buyer Indemnified Party for the claim at issue, and provide a copy of such notice of claim to the CSE Holders, and (B) notify third parties who would reasonably be expected to have an obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to any contract, lease or purchase agreement for the claim at issue, and provide a copy of such notice and any response thereto to the CSE Holders. 

   

 (iii) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be required to accept, use or impose engineering controls, institutional controls or restrictive covenants as part or all of a response action, Remedial Action or other action (all referred to collectively and individually in this Section 7.3(e) as " _Restrictions_ ") unless: 

  

       | (1)  |   | the Restrictions will not materially
interfere with the conduct of any Business operations at any of the Assets of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or Leased Real Property;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (2)  |   | the Restrictions do not conflict with the terms of any
lease at any of the Leased Real Properties and the landlord at the Leased
Real Property consents to the Restrictions;  
      
    | (3)  |   | the CSE Holders pay, or provide a funding mechanism to
pay, for the installation and all operation, maintenance, repair and
replacement of all Restrictions for a thirty (30) year period or until the
termination of all Restrictions, whichever is earlier; and  
      
    | (4)  |   | if the costs, at a single property, of completing any
actions referred to in (i), above, without any Restrictions to satisfy the
Buyer Damages are not more than $200,000 more than the costs of completing
such actions with Restrictions, then such actions shall be completed without
Restrictions. If the costs, at a single property, of completing any actions
referred to in (i) above, without Restrictions to satisfy the Buyer Damages
are more than $200,000 more than the costs of completing such actions
with Restrictions, then Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not implement
the actions at that single property without Restrictions unless
Buyer Indemnified Parties pay the amount of the costs for such actions
which exceed that $200,000 incremental amount. The CSE Holders shall pay all
the costs except for such amount in excess of  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   |  the $200,000 incremental amount. In all cases, the
Assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Leased Real Property shall not
be subject to any Restrictions that do not allow non-residential use of such
Assets or Leased Real Property.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

   

 (iv) Buyer Indemnified Parties shall control the defense of any claim and the actions to meet obligations which are a subject of a claim for indemnification by Buyer Indemnified Parties, including all contacts, communications and meetings with Governmental Authorities and non-governmental third-party claimants. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall provide the CSE Holders with a reasonable opportunity of not less than seven (7) Business Days (if feasible and no violation of Environmental Law will result because of such a delay) prior to their anticipated submission to the relevant Governmental Authorities to review and comment upon drafts of all documents to be submitted by the Buyer Indemnified Parties in connection with any response action, Remedial Action or other action in response to a matter that is the subject of an indemnification claim. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall make a good faith effort to include the CSE Holders reasonable and substantive comments regarding the content of the documents prior to their submission by the Buyer Indemnified Parties to the extent that such comments are supportable by and in compliance with the applicable Environmental Law. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall promptly provide the CSE Holders with written notice, at least five (5) Business Days (if feasible and no violation of Environmental Law will result because of such a delay) prior to meeting with any representatives of any Governmental Authority or other parties to such matter, and the CSE Holders shall have the right to attend such meetings.

Agreement, and (ii) for any available remedy at law or equity with respect to
fraud or any breach by the other party if such breach is willful.

 (a) by mutual written consent of each of Buyer and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand; 

   

 (b) by Buyer, if (i) there has been a material violation or material breach by the Company or any CSE Holder of any covenant contained in this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Buyer at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by Buyer or cured by the Company or the CSE Holder to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer within fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof to the Company or the CSE Holder from Buyer, (ii) the Company has failed to deliver to Buyer the financial statements described in Section 5.12(c) hereof by the date of delivery set forth in such Section 5.12(c), or (iii) the Companys independent registered public accounting firm shall have failed to perform the SAS 100 review or to deliver, if and when requested by Buyer in accordance with Section 5.12(d), the consents and letters described in Section 5.12(d) within the timeframes specified in such Section 5.12(d); 

   

 (c) by the Company, if (i) on or after March 31, 2008 (the " _Outside Date_ "), (A) all the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 would be satisfied or waived if the Closing Date were at the time of such termination and (B) the Company stands ready to satisfy all the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (other than those already satisfied or waived) and has notified Buyer in writing thereof and Buyer has not consummated the Merger on or before the close of business on the Outside Date, or (ii) there has been a material violation or material breach by Buyer of any covenant contained in this Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the Company, the CSE Holders, the Stockholders and Hill at the Closing and such violation or breach has not been waived by the Company or cured by Buyer to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company within fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof to Buyer by the Company (provided that the failure of Buyer to deliver the Merger Consideration as required pursuant to Article I above shall not be subject to cure hereunder) (it being understood that, if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c), then the Company shall be paid the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b)); 

   

 (d) by the Company or Buyer if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) shall not be available to a Party whose failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement (with the Company having responsibility for the performance of 

    ##### 

  

    

the Stockholders and Hill in this regard) has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before such date
except in the case of a termination pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) by Buyer
provided that Buyer pays the Termination Fee to the Company; 

   

 (e) by the Company or Buyer if a Governmental Authority shall have issued an order or taken any other action, in each case, which has become final and non-appealable and which restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Merger; and 

   

 (f) by Buyer within two (2) Business Days following the date hereof if the Stockholder Consent, executed by the Stockholders who in the aggregate hold a majority of the voting power represented by all the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock entitled to vote on the Merger and pursuant to which such Stockholders adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the DGCL, is not delivered to the Company and Buyer within two (2) hours following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by all the Parties hereto. 

   

 8.2 _Effect of Termination_  

  

 (a) Except as provided in this Section 8.2, in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement (other than this Section 8.2 and Sections 5.1(c), 8.3 and Article IX, each of which shall survive such termination) will forthwith become void, and there will be no liability on the part of any Party or any of their respective officers or directors to any other Party and all rights and obligations of each Party will cease, except that nothing herein will relieve any Party (for this purpose, the Company shall have responsibility for any CSE Holder breach) from liability for any willful breach, prior to termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ that in circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b), such fee (together with interest thereon as provided in Section 8.2(b) and attorneys fees as provided in Section 9.1, in each case to the extent applicable) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the CSE Holders and their Affiliates with respect thereto and with respect to the termination of this Agreement and any breach by Buyer in such circumstances. 

   

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(d) at a time when the Company could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Buyer shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) days following such termination) pay an amount equal to the Termination Fee to the Company. The Parties agree that the Termination Fee is intended to compromise any dispute over the damage that the Company, the CSE Holders and any of their Affiliates would suffer as a result of such a termination, that it is a reasonable measure of the damage the Company, the CSE Holders and any such Affiliates would actually suffer and is in no respect whatsoever a penalty. Payment of the Termination Fee is in lieu of damages to which the Company, the CSE Holders and any of their Affiliates would be entitled as a result of Buyers breach of this Agreement or any other document contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent paid, is the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the CSE Holders and their Affiliates for a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or pursuant to Section 8.1(d) at a time when the Company 

    ##### 

  

    

could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (and for any
Buyers breach in such circumstances). The Company, the CSE Holders and Buyer
acknowledge that the agreement contained in this Section 8.2(b) is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that without this agreement, the Company, the CSE Holders and Buyer would not
have entered into this Agreement. The Company shall be entitled to interest
on the Termination Fee, at the Overnight Money Market rate as published by
the bank used by Buyer to invest overnight funds, for the period commencing
on the date that is ten (10) days following the date of such termination and
ending on the date that the Termination Fee is paid. 

   

 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_  

  

 Except as set forth in Article VII or in Sections 1.7, 1.19(b), 1.19(e), 5.7, 5.9(g), 5.16, 9.1 and this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the HSR Act and Competition Law filing costs incurred by the Parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by Buyer. 

  

 8.4 _Amendment_  

  

 This Agreement may be amended at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided that this Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the Company, the Stockholders Representative (who shall, subject to the terms set forth in Section 1.20, be authorized to act for the CSE Holders in this regard) and Buyer. 

  

 8.5 _Waiver_  

  

 At any time prior to the Effective Time, any Party may extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts required hereunder, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument signed by the Party to be bound thereby.

 9.8 _Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver_  

  

 No failure or delay on the part of any Party in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.

 This Agreement and the rights and duties of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Law of the State of New York; provided that the effectiveness of the Merger shall be governed by the DGCL.
