 5.6 _Loan Loss Reserve_.

Any notice relating to the inaccuracy or change in the Disclosure Schedule

Notwithstanding the foregoing, FIBS representatives shall not be permitted to attend any portion of a meeting and First Western shall not be required to provide FIBS with any materials, if the attendance or provision would violate applicable Law or constitute a waiver of the attorney client privilege by First Western or a Target Subsidiary.

material fact or will omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading or necessary to correct

Target Subsidiary employees will retain credit for unused vacation and sick days which are accrued or will be accrued with a Target Subsidiary as of the Closing. If any Target Subsidiary employees become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of FIBS or its subsidiaries, FIBS shall cause, to the extent permitted by such plans and Law, each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the applicable medical, dental or health plans of First Western, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such employees and their beneficiaries under similar plans of First Western from the beginning of First Westerns plan year, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee or such employees beneficiaries on or after the Closing to the extent such employee or such employees beneficiaries had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the Closing.

Unless or until this Agreement is terminated, First Western will not, and will cause each Target Subsidiary not to, directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or proposals from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any nonpublic information to or consider the merits of any unsolicited inquiries or proposals from any Person relating to any offer or potential transaction for the acquisition of the controlling interest in any of First Western or the Target Subsidiaries, or the merger, share exchange or other reorganization of First Western or Target Subsidiaries with any Person or the sale of assets by First Western or a Target Subsidiary outside of the ordinary course of business.

 7.1.2 By either First Western or FIBS upon written notice to the other party if a request for Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or recommendation of a Regulator unless within the fifteen (15) Business Day period following such denial or withdrawal FIBS elects to file, and First Western consents to the filing of, a petition for rehearing, amended application or other request for review of the application; provided, however, that no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement if the denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal of the application shall be caused by a Material Default of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement. 

   

 7.1.3 By either FIBS or First Western if the Closing Date is not on or before July 11, 2008 unless the failure of the Closing Date to occur on or before such date is caused by a Material Default of the party desiring to terminate.

the Required Financing is not available to FIBS on any terms. 

   

 7.1.6 By either First Western or FIBS if there shall have been a Material Default by the other party providing that the terminating party is not then in Material Default. 

  

 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. 

   

 7.2.1 If FIBS or First Western terminates this Agreement (a) by reason of failure of Shareholder Approval to timely occur, or (b) by reason of a failure in the condition stated in Section 6.2.6 relating to the S Election, First Western shall promptly pay to FIBS, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, the sum of $5,000,000.00 (the "First Western Termination Fee"). The First Western Termination Fee shall be paid to FIBS within two (2) business days following written notice of the demand and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by FIBS in the notice. 

   

 7.2.2 If FIBS terminates this Agreement under Section 7.1.5(a) or by reason of a failure of the condition stated in Section 6.3.5(a), FIBS shall promptly pay to First Western, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, the sum of $5,000,000.00 (the "FIBS Termination Fee").

 7.3 _Termination Fee in Lieu of Damages_.

 7.4 _Remedies_. Unless a party is entitled to receive a termination fee, upon the occurrence of a Material Default by a party which remains uncured for the period of time accorded under this Agreement, a party shall be entitled to pursue such rights and remedies as may be accorded at law or in equity, and in addition to and not in limitation of any other right or remedy, to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party in the terminating partys discretion.

from, any and all loss, cost, damage, penalty or expense, including, without
limitation, attorneys fees, arising out of or related to: 

   

 8.1.1 With respect to the Deferred Liabilities (a) the existence, or assertion by any Person of the existence of, liability or obligation for Deferred Liabilities which in the aggregate cause the Deferred Liabilities to be in excess of the Deferred Liability Amount or (b) the failure of any Deferred Liability, or any document, agreement, resolution, plan or similar instrument creating a Deferred Liability, to comply with Law or (c) the imposition or attempt to impose any tax, penalty, surcharge, interest or other amount by reason of the Deferred Liabilities or (d) the failure of the representation and warranty stated in Section 4.30 to be materially true and correct as of the Closing. 

   

 8.1.2 The travel matters described in the letter of First Western dated as of August 15, 2007, including, without limitation, any injury, death or damage suffered by any employee of the Target Subsidiaries in connection with such travel.

 8.1.4 The failure of any representation or warranty of First Western to be materially true and correct as of the date made or deemed made by First Western, except to the extent such failure is disclosed to FIBS in writing prior to the Closing and in accordance with Section 5.9. 

   

 8.1.5 The failure of the Financial Statements or Closing Financial Statements, provided by First Western or Banks after the Effective Date to (a) fairly and accurately present the respective financial position, assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Target Subsidiaries at the respective dates of, and for the periods referred to in, such statements or (b) include any material assets or omit to state any material liabilities, absolute or contingent, or other facts, which inclusion or omission would render such financial statements misleading in any material respect. 

   

 8.1.6 The assertion, whether successful on the merits or otherwise, by any Person of any right, title or interest in or to the Target Subsidiary Stock or the failure of the representation and warranty of First Western under Section 4.4 to be materially true and correct. 

   

 8.1.7 The obligation of a Target Subsidiary to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent for any loss, cost, expense, damage, award, penalty or attorneys fees arising out of or related to an act, omission or occurrence prior to

the Closing except to the extent such obligation is reimbursed or paid
directly under insurance policies. 

   

 8.1.8 The assertion, whether successful on the merits or otherwise, of any claim (a) arising out of or related to the matters described in the letter dated September 14, 2007 referred to in Section 4.14 of the Disclosure Schedule or (b) arising out of or related to a loan or other extension of credit made by a Bank and sold, participated in whole or in part or otherwise transferred to or for the benefit of First Western or a First Western Affiliate (other than a Bank) on or prior to the Closing Date.

 8.1.10 The failure of the contemplated transactions to qualify as a purchase of Target Subsidiary assets by FIBS for all purposes of the Code and regulations thereunder, including, without limitation, the loss of any item of deduction by FIBS or FIBS Affiliates for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the indemnification under this Section 8.1.10, the parties acknowledge and agree that the costs, expenses and damages of the failure of the contemplated transactions to qualify as a purchase of Target Subsidiary assets under the Code and regulations would be impossible or impractical of calculation as of the time of such determination and, therefore, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, the parties agree to establish for all purposes of this Section 8.1.10, the amount of such indemnification to be Thirty One Million Dollars ($31,000,000.00), such amount to be in addition to any amount to which FIBS may be entitled to under Section 8.1.9. 

  

 8.2 _Limitations on First Western Indemnification Obligations_. FIBS and FIBS Affiliates shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to this Agreement until all Indemnification Demands of FIBS or FIBS Affiliates, net of any tax benefits to FIBS and insurance coverage available to FIBS or FIBS Affiliates including the Target Subsidiaries, exceed the sum of $500,000.00, at which time all such claims for indemnification including the first $500,000.00 of such liabilities that are actually incurred or sustained by FIBS, FIBS Affiliates or the Target Subsidiaries, net of any tax benefits and insurance coverage that may be available to them, may be asserted. For these purposes, "tax benefits available to FIBS, FIBS Affiliates or the Target Subsidiaries" (a) shall be calculated based upon the consolidated income tax liability of FIBS and its consolidated subsidiaries for the relevant fiscal year and (b) after giving effect to the inclusion in income or other tax effects of any required or proposed indemnification payment and (c) shall not be applied in any respect to the matter described in Section 8.1.10. In no event shall First Western be obligated to indemnify FIBS or FIBS Affiliates in an aggregate amount which exceeds the sum of $31,000,000.00 with respect to Section 8.1.10 of this Agreement or the sum of $19,000,000.00 with respect to Section 8.1.1 through Section 8.1.9 of this Agreement.

 8.3.1 If FIBS shall demand indemnification under this Agreement, it shall notify First Western by written notice to First Western (the "Indemnification Demand"). FIBS shall provide written notice to First Western of any Indemnification Demand as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days, after discovery by FIBS of such claim. Failure to give such notice within thirty (30) days of discovery by FIBS of such claim shall not abrogate or diminish First Westerns obligations under this Article 8.0 if either First Western had or received knowledge of the existence of any such claim by any other means or if such failure does not materially prejudice First Westerns ability to defend such claim. The Indemnification Demand shall set forth: 

   

 (a) the estimated amount of indemnification required under this Agreement; 

   

 (b) the nature and basis of the Indemnification Demand with reasonable specificity as to the events, occurrences or information giving rise to the Indemnification Demand; and 

   

 (c) the date upon which such events, occurrences or information became known to FIBS. 

   

 8.3.2 If the Indemnification Demand shall arise out of or be related to any litigation, administrative proceeding, negotiation or arbitration or pertaining to any demand of a third party asserting liability of FIBS or the Target Subsidiaries (the "Third Party Claim"), First Western shall have the right to select counsel to represent FIBS at First Westerns sole cost and expense, subject to FIBS consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, and to otherwise control such litigation, proceedings, negotiations or arbitration, so long as First Western notifies FIBS in writing within ten (10) business days after notice of such Third Party Claim that First Western will defend and indemnify FIBS against such Third Party Claim as provided in Section 8.1 and so long as such Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief. So long as First Western is conducting the defense of such Third Party Claim, FIBS may, but shall not be obligated to, retain separate counsel at its sole cost and expense and may participate in defense of such claim, but shall not control the defense, and First Western will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the written consent of FIBS, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld. The parties shall cooperate in the defense of any such claim, including providing to the other party on request any information and documentation in their possession which is reasonably necessary to defend such claim and providing reasonable access to all books, records and personnel in their possession or under their control which would have a bearing on the defense of such claim. If First Western shall fail to notify FIBS in writing within ten (10) business days after notice from FIBS of such Third Party Claim that First Western will defend and indemnify FIBS against such Third Party Claim as

provided in Section 8.1 or if First Western shall notify FIBS in writing
within such time period that First Western declines to defend such Third
Party Claim, FIBS shall have the right, but not the obligation, to undertake
the defense of and to compromise or settle such Third Party Claim on behalf,
for the account and at the expense of First Western subject to the right of
set-off described in Section 9.5, but FIBS will not consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party
Claim without the written consent of First Western, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld. 

  

 8.4 _Termination of First Western Indemnification Obligations_. The indemnification obligations of First Western shall terminate: (a) with respect to the matters described in Sections 8.1.1, on the first anniversary of the date upon which the last payment on the respective Deferred Liability was due and payable in accordance with its terms; (b) with respect to the matters described in Section 8.1.2, the second anniversary of the date upon which the travel is completed, and (c) with respect to Section 8.1.8, the third anniversary of the Closing Date and (d) with respect to Sections 8.1.9 and 8.1.10, the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the date upon which the final Tax or informational returns of First Western or First Western Affiliates for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date or that include the Closing Date are actually filed, such termination date to be extended, however, by the period of time, if any, during which the statute of limitations for any such return or filing is extended by consent or agreement of First Western or First Western Affiliates or by operation of Law or (ii) the date of delivery to FIBS of a copy of a closing agreement signed by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its audit of the built-in gains on the termination of the S Election with respect to Target Subsidiaries and allocation of gain on sale of the Target Subsidiaries under the pre-filing agreement program of the Internal Revenue Service and (e) unless otherwise provided, on the second anniversary of the Closing Date. The termination of the indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall not apply to any Indemnification Demand provided to First Western prior to the indemnification termination date but which has not been fully and finally resolved as of such date. First Westerns indemnification obligations shall continue in full force and effect until all such Indemnification Demands shall have been fully and finally resolved. 

  

 8.5 _Continuation of Indemnification_. The indemnification obligations shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, their respective successors and assigns, it being the express intention of the parties that First Westerns indemnification obligations shall survive the merger, dissolution or liquidation of First Western or any affiliate of First Western or the transfer of the Preferred Stock. 

  

 8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. FIBS acknowledges and agrees that the indemnification provisions in this Article 8.0 shall be, in the absence of actual fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy of FIBS and FIBS Affiliates or First Western or First Western Affiliates with respect to the matters described in Section 8.1. 

  

 8.7 _Arbitration_. In the event of any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to an Indemnification Demand, the parties agree to exercise their best efforts to 

 

 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
       |   |   
   STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT   |   | Page 45  
    ##### 

  

    

resolve the dispute as soon as possible. The parties shall, without delay,
continue to perform their respective obligations under the Agreement which
are not affected by the dispute. Any controversies or disputes arising out of
or relating to an Indemnification Demand that is not resolved by the parties
within sixty (60) days following the delivery of the Indemnification
Demand shall be resolved by binding arbitration upon demand of either party
and in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association. Such dispute is not required to be
submitted to the American Arbitration Association for resolution if
the parties mutually agree to forego such submission. In the event the
parties do not agree, then such dispute shall be submitted to the American
Arbitration Association. The parties shall endeavor to select a mutually
acceptable arbitrator knowledgeable about issues relating to the subject
matter of any dispute. In the event the parties are unable to agree to such a
selection within ten (10) Business Days following a partys demand for
arbitration, each party will immediately select an arbitrator and the
arbitrators in turn shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitration shall
take place at a location that is reasonably centrally located between the
parties, or otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties. All documents,
materials, and information in the possession of each party that are in any
way relevant to the claim(s) or dispute(s) shall be made available to
the other party for review and copying no later than thirty (30) days after
the demand for arbitration is served. The arbitrator(s) shall not have the
authority, power, or right to alter, change, amend, modify, add, or subtract
from any provision of the Agreement or to award punitive damages. The
arbitrator shall have the power to issue mandatory orders and restraining
orders in connection with the arbitration. The award rendered by the
arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be
entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction. During the continuance of
any arbitration proceeding, the parties shall continue to perform their
respective obligations under the Agreement. Fees, costs and expenses of the
arbitrator shall be borne equally by FIBS and First Western and each party
shall be responsible for their respective fees and costs incurred, including
their respective attorneys fees. 

  

 8.8 _Interest_. All amounts for which FIBS or FIBS Affiliates are entitled to indemnification shall bear interest at the fixed rate of 6.75% per annum from the date the Indemnification Demand is made until amounts due or to become due under the Indemnification Demand are satisfied. 

 

9.0 _Post Closing Covenants_. 

   

 9.1 _Limitation on Business Activities_. First Western and First Western Affiliates, with the exception of the Insurance Agency in the ordinary course of its general insurance agency activities existing on the Effective Date, shall refrain, for a period of three (3) years commencing on the Closing Date from (a) soliciting, directly or indirectly, the banking or financial business or relationship of any individual or entity (i) with a principal place of business within a thirty (30) mile radius of any office of a Target Subsidiary or (ii) that is, or was within twelve (12) months prior to the Closing Date a loan or deposit customer of a Bank, or (b) owning any interest in a depository organization with an office within a thirty (30) mile radius of any office of a

Target Subsidiary (excluding, however, ownership of interests in publicly
traded entities). 

  

 9.2 _First Western Name and Marks_. On and after the Closing Date, First Western and First Western Affiliates shall cease using the First Western name and associated marks, tradenames and trademarks and shall change its or their corporate name to a name not similar to First Western and otherwise reasonably acceptable to FIBS; provided, however, for so long as the Agency Agreement remains in effect, First Western may use and permit the Insurance Agency to use the First Western name and associated marks, tradenames and trademarks consistent with the Insurance Agencys prior practices. If requested by FIBS within 180 days following the termination or expiration of the Agency Agreement, First Western shall and shall cause the Agency to promptly cease use of the First Western name and associated marks, tradenames and trademarks. 

  

 9.3 _Liquidation or Dissolution._ First Western shall provide (a) FIBS prior written notice of the submission to the Board of Directors of First Western of a plan of liquidation or dissolution at any time prior to the termination of all indemnification obligations of First Western including final resolution of all Indemnification Demands, and (b) FIBS copies of all plans, notices, creditor notices and filings with any governmental agency or authority arising out of or related to such plan of liquidation or dissolution. First Western shall not dissolve or liquidate without the prior written consent of FIBS, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 9.4 _Transfer of Preferred Stock_. Except with the prior written consent of FIBS which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and provided First Western has complied with all transfer restrictions set forth in this Agreement, the Preferred Stock or otherwise required by applicable Securities Laws, prior to the full and final satisfaction of, and termination of, the indemnification obligations of First Western under this Agreement and the satisfaction of all Set-Off Amounts, neither First Western nor any permitted successor shall sell, assign, transfer, pledge, grant a security interest in or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in or to the FIBS Securities, including, without limitation, any distribution by First Western or any permitted successor to or for the benefit of any First Western shareholder. Without limiting the foregoing, as a condition to the consent of FIBS, FIBS may in its discretion require any transferee or other successor to First Western in or to the FIBS Securities to execute and deliver documents or instruments necessary or appropriate in the judgment of FIBS (a) for the compliance with any Law including, without limitation, the Securities Laws, or (b) relating to the right of setoff or other remedy of FIBS with respect to the Preferred Stock. 

  

 9.5 _Set Off_. First Western grants to FIBS, for and on behalf of itself and any legal successor and future holders of the Preferred Stock, a right of setoff against all dividends, distributions or other payment FIBS may make on or with respect to the Preferred Stock, whether in redemption or otherwise, for any obligation of First Western to indemnify FIBS or an FIBS Affiliate under this Agreement. The right of 

 

 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
       |   |   
   STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT   |   | Page 47  
    ##### 

  

    

setoff is in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other right or remedy
available to FIBS under this Agreement, at law or in equity. 

   

 9.5.1 First Western may, in its discretion, designate a liquidating trust or other entity for the benefit of the shareholders of First Western. Subject to the prior written consent of FIBS as provided in this Agreement and in the terms of the Preferred Stock, First Western may distribute all of the Preferred Stock as soon as practicable following the Closing to the trustee of such trust (or other entity reasonably acceptable to FIBS). Notwithstanding the distribution or transfer of any of the Preferred Stock, with or without the consent of FIBS, FIBS shall be entitled to set-off against the Preferred Stock, subject to the provisions of this Section 9.5, for any amounts due to it from First Western pursuant to the indemnification provisions of Article 8.0. Upon request of FIBS, and as a condition to FIBS consent, if any, to any transfer of the Preferred Stock, FIBS may require any successor holder of the Preferred Stock to execute and deliver such instruments and documents as FIBS may reasonably request evidencing, among other things, the successors acknowledgement of the indemnification and setoff provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 9.5.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, FIBS shall not be entitled to exercise its rights of set-off in respect of any Indemnification Demand under this Agreement until such time as either (i) First Western has agreed to pay such Indemnification Demand or (ii) such Indemnification Demand has been reduced to a final, non-appealable judgment in the case of a Third Party Claim or (iii) the amount of such Indemnification Demand has been otherwise resolved by arbitration or otherwise under this Agreement. In the event an Indemnification Demand is disputed in part by First Western, First Western agrees to approve for set-off the undisputed amount of such Indemnification Demand. The amount of any Indemnification Demand that First Western agrees to pay or the amount of any such Indemnification Demand determined by judgment or arbitration is referred to herein as the "Set-Off Amount". 

   

 9.5.3 Once a Set-Off Amount is so determined, FIBS shall give First Western and the record holders, if different, written notice of at least five (5) business days of its intention to effectuate the set-off pursuant to this Section 9.5, which notice (a "Notice of Set-Off") will specify in reasonable detail the basis for the set-off, the effective date of the set-off, the Set-Off Amount and the method of effecting the set-off in this Section 9.5.3. Such Set-Off Amount shall be made first by withdrawal of the Escrowed Dividends (as defined below), if any; second by setoff against not more than seventy-five percent (75%) of any subsequent dividends or other distributions payable to the holders of the Preferred Stock; and, third by setoff against any liquidating payments payable to the holder(s) of the Preferred Stock. In addition, and not in limitation of the foregoing, FIBS may redeem, by written notice to the holder of the Preferred Stock, that number of shares (and fractions thereof as applicable) of Preferred Stock having a liquidation amount (initially $10,000.00 per share) equal to the 

 

 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
       |   |   
   STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT   |   | Page 48  
    ##### 

  

    

remaining Set-Off Amount remaining unpaid at any time. Except as provided in
the preceding sentences, nothing in this Section 9.5 shall relieve FIBS from
paying dividends when declared on the Preferred Stock in accordance with its
terms. Within ten (10) business days of the date of receipt of the notice of
redemption, the holder of the Preferred Stock shall submit to FIBS for
cancellation certificates representing a liquidation amount of Preferred
Stock equal to or exceeding the Set-Off Amount. FIBS shall promptly cause to
be issued and delivered to the then holder certificates representing the
excess shares (and fractions thereof as applicable) of Preferred Stock
submitted, registered in the name of the then holder. The redemption of
Preferred Stock for the payment of a Set-Off Amount is within the sole
discretion of FIBS and subject to the prior approval of Regulators
having jurisdiction over FIBS. Nothing in this Agreement is intended, or
shall be interpreted to require, FIBS to redeem all or any portion of the
Preferred Stock at any time or under any circumstances. 

   

 9.5.4 The maximum aggregate Set-Off Amount shall not exceed the sum of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00). No dividends previously paid prior to the date of an Indemnification Demand on the Preferred Stock shall be subject to set-off or recoupment. 

   

 9.5.5 For so long as an Indemnification Demand is disputed, outstanding, unresolved, or unpaid seventy-five percent (75%) of each dividend declared and paid on the Preferred Stock (the "Escrowed Dividends") shall be paid by FIBS to an escrow account to be established by FIBS with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., U.S. Bank, N.A. or Zions Bank or, if none of the foregoing banks are willing or able to serve as escrow agent, a bank selected by FIBS with capital in excess of $1.0 billion and not then affiliated with FIBS (the "Escrow Agent") to be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in United States Treasury obligations (or such other investments as directed from time to time by the joint written instructions of FIBS and First Western to the Escrow Agent), and the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of each such dividend shall be paid to the holder of the Preferred Stock. The Escrow Agent shall distribute the Escrowed Dividends and any and all earnings thereon to FIBS or the holder when and to the extent that such Indemnification Demand is resolved in accordance with the joint written instructions of FIBS and First Western. Income taxes due on amounts earned on the Escrowed Dividends shall be payable by the parties entitled to such Escrowed Dividends in the proportions ultimately distributed to them. FIBS shall furnish First Western and the holder of the Preferred Stock with a copy of the escrow agreement for review and comments before it is executed and with a signed copy of the escrow agreement when it is executed. 

   

 9.5.6 For purposes of FIBS notice and other obligations under this Agreement, the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be the Person or Persons registered as the legal owner of the Preferred Stock upon FIBS books and records.

 9.6 _Termination of FIBS Representations and Warranties_. Except for the representations and warranties of FIBS stated in Section 3.4, 3.5, 3.8 and 3.9 the representations and warranties of FIBS shall terminate immediately following the Closing. The representations and warranties of FIBS stated in Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.8 and 3.9 shall survive the Closing and terminate upon the earlier of the redemption of all shares of Preferred Stock or the conversion of the respective shares of Preferred Stock to Common Stock. 

  

 9.7 _Plans_. Neither FIBS nor FIBS Affiliates are assuming any obligation or liability under the Plans. First Western shall be solely responsible for the administration, maintenance and funding of the Plans following the Closing. First Western shall retain all liability and responsibility, whether imposed by state or federal law, for providing continuation coverage of health insurance to all employees and former employees of First Western or the Target Subsidiaries whose "qualifying events" occur on or before the Closing Date, and FIBS shall not be considered a "successor employer" or to maintain a "successor plan" to First Westerns group medical plan for purposes of such continuation health coverage. First Western acknowledges that closing of the contemplated transactions will cause a partial termination of the Plans and may cause employees of the Target Subsidiaries to become vested under the Plans and that all funding or other costs of such partial termination or vesting shall be borne solely by First Western. First Western shall take all actions necessary to cause all Plans to remain qualified under ERISA and the Code following the Closing, except to the extent any failure to remain so qualified does not create or impose any liability or other obligation of the Target Subsidiaries, FIBS or FIBS Affiliates. 

  

 9.8 _Information_. Each of First Western and FIBS shall, and shall cause its respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents and representatives to, cooperate render assistance and provide access to information, records, books, personnel and properties reasonably requested by the other party in connection with the preparation, filing or completion of any tax, regulatory, financial, securities or similar returns, audits, reports or filings or to otherwise effectuate the intent of this Agreement and the contemplated transactions. 

  

 9.9 _Purchase Price Allocation_. First Western and FIBS shall each allocate the Purchase Price among the assets of the Target Subsidiaries as of the Closing for Tax purposes. Each party shall use commercial reasonable efforts to prepare such allocation within one hundred twenty (120) days of the Closing after taking into account any appraisals of assets other than tangible personal property that may be obtained by First Western and FIBS, the applicable Treasury Regulations under the Code and the fair market value of such items. First Western and FIBS agree that the fair market value of the tangible personal property, including computer hardware and software, but excluding tangible personal property segregated from real property as a result of cost segregation studies, is the Target Subsidiaries income tax basis thereof. Each of First Western and FIBS shall prepare for filing all Tax returns that may be required with respect to the transaction provided for herein pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code, any Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, any other similar provision of the Code and any other similar, applicable foreign, state or local tax law or regulation. FIBS and

       |   |

First Western shall provide the other copies of all valuation, appraisal, and
similar reports or information that each party intends to rely on for
purposes of determining the allocation of Purchase Price for Tax purposes in
addition to any other reports or information that may be required by either
party for the purpose of preparing any Tax returns. 

  

 9.10 _Payment of Deferred Liabilities_. FIBS agrees to pay or to cause the Target Subsidiaries to pay all Deferred Liabilities to the employees or payees thereof at the respective times and in the respective amounts required by and in accordance with the Deferred Liability Documents and up to the Deferred Liability Amount. 

 

10.0 _General Provisions_. 

   

 10.1 _Public Statements; Confidentiality_. Neither FIBS or FIBS Affiliates nor First Western or First Western Affiliates shall make any public announcement or statement with respect to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any related transactions without the approval of FIBS and First Western; provided, however, that FIBS and First Western may, upon reasonable notice to the other party, make any public announcement or statement that it reasonably believes is required by Law. Between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, each of First Western and FIBS shall, and shall cause their respective directors, officers, agents and employees to, maintain in confidence all information relating to the contemplated transactions except for disclosures (a) made with the consent of the other party, (b) necessary or appropriate for seeking any consents or approvals of the contemplated transactions including the Regulatory Approvals, (c) necessary or appropriate for the enforcement or interpretation of this Agreement in legal proceedings, or (d) in the reasonable judgment of the party making the disclosure, required for compliance with Law.

 _Exhibit A_ 

   

Statement of Designations, Rights, Preferences and Limitations 
 for the 
 First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. 
 Series A Preferred Stock 

   

 First Interstate BancSystem, Inc., a Montana corporation (the "Corporation"), hereby designates 5,000 shares of the Corporations presently authorized preferred stock, without par value ("Preferred Stock"), as "6.75% Series A Noncumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock" (the "Series A Preferred Stock"). The Series A Preferred Stock shall be a single series of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and shall be issued on terms and subject to rights and conditions required under Federal Reserve regulations and policy statements generally applicable to bank holding companies for qualification as Tier 1 capital, including, without limitation, Federal Reserve Regulation Y, Appendix A. The preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and other terms and conditions of the Series A Preferred Stock are as follows: 

  

 1. _Rank_. The Series A Preferred Stock will, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation of the Corporation, rank senior to all classes or series of the Corporations common stock, without par value ("Common Stock"), and to all equity securities whether now or hereafter issued by the Corporation. 

  

 2. _Dividends_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 2(f), holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors"), out of funds legally available therefor, noncumulative cash dividends at a rate per annum equal to 6.75% of the liquidation preference thereof from, and including, [date of issue] (the "Issue Date"). Such dividends shall be payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year (each, a "Dividend Payment Date"), commencing [date] and shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in such Dividend Period (as defined below); provided, however, that if any Dividend Payment Date other than a Redemption Date (as defined in Section 4(a)) falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined below), then any dividends payable shall be paid on, and such Dividend Payment Date shall be moved to, the next succeeding Business Day, and additional dividends shall accrue for each day such payment is delayed as a result thereof. Dividends declared in respect of a Dividend Payment Date shall be payable to the holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock appearing in the stock records of the Corporation at the close of business on the applicable record date (whether or not a Business Day), which shall be a date designated by the Board of Directors for the payment of dividends that is not less than 10 nor more than 60 calendar days immediately preceding such Dividend Payment Date (each, a "Dividend Record Date"). 

    

"Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on
which banking institutions in the City of New York or Billings, Montana are
permitted or required by law, executive order or regulation to close. 

   ##### 

  

   

"Dividend Period" means (i) in the case of the initial period, the period
from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the initial Dividend
Payment Date (the "Initial Dividend Period") and (ii) thereafter, the period
from, and including, the first day following the end of the preceding
Dividend Period to, but excluding, the applicable Dividend Payment Date or,
in the case of the last Dividend Period, the related Redemption Date, as
applicable. 

  

 (b) No dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be authorized or declared or paid or set apart for payment by the Corporation if at such time (i) the terms and provisions of any agreement of the Corporation, including any agreement relating to its indebtedness, prohibits such authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment or provides that such authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would constitute a breach or default thereunder or (ii) such authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment shall be restricted or prohibited by law. 

   

 (c) Except as otherwise specified herein, the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends in excess of the full noncumulative dividends declared thereon. In addition, no interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. 

   

 (d) Except as provided in the next succeeding sentence, if any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividends or other distributions shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment, and no other dividend or distribution shall be declared or made upon, the Corporations Common Stock or any other equity securities of the Corporation unless full dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid for three consecutive Dividend Periods, the most recent of which is the then current Dividend Period, or, if there have been fewer than three Dividend Periods since the Issue Date, for each Dividend Period commencing on or after such Issue Date. When dividends are not paid in full upon the Series A Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series A Preferred Stock shall be authorized and declared by the Corporation on a pro rata basis so that the amount of dividends per share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be the same. 

   

 (e) If any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, none of the Corporations Common Stock or other equity securities shall be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired, directly or indirectly, for any consideration (or any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption thereof) by the Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for the Corporations Common Stock or other equity securities ranking, as to dividends and upon liquidation, junior to the Series A Preferred Stock) unless full dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid for three consecutive Dividend Periods, the most recent of which is the then current Dividend Period, or, if there have been fewer than three Dividend Periods since the Issue Date of Series A Preferred Stock, for each Dividend Period commencing on or after such Issue Date. 

   

 (f) If declared by the Board of Directors, dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be paid in cash or immediately available funds on the applicable Dividend Payment Date; provided, however, that the Corporation shall have the right to direct that the 

    ##### 

  

    

dividends otherwise payable to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall be made to the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Section
7. 

   

 3. _Liquidation_. 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 3(e), in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (collectively, a "liquidation"), holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to stockholders (after payment or provision for payment of all debts and other liabilities of the Corporation) an amount equal to the liquidation preference of $10,000 per share, plus (i) all accrued but unpaid dividends for the then current Dividend Period (whether or not earned or declared) until the date of payment and (ii) all accrued but unpaid dividends that have been declared with respect to one or more prior Dividend Periods (but without accumulation of any previously undeclared and unpaid dividends for prior Dividend Periods), before any distribution of assets is made to holders of the Corporations Common Stock or any other equity securities. After payment of the full liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. 

   

 (b) If, upon any liquidation of the Corporation, the legally available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to make full payment to holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, then the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. 

   

 (c) The following events, individually or as part of a series of transactions, shall not be considered a liquidation of the Corporation within the meaning of this Section 3: (i) a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another entity; (ii) the merger of another entity with or into the Corporation; (iii) a statutory share exchange by the Corporation; or (iv) a sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of less than 50% of the Corporations assets. 

   

 (d) Written notice of any liquidation of the Corporation, stating the amount of any resulting liquidating distributions and the payment date when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by the Corporation by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days immediately preceding the payment date stated therein, to each holder of record of Series A Preferred Stock at its address appearing in the stock records of the Corporation. 

   

 (e) Liquidating payments to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be paid in cash or immediately available funds; provided, however, that the Corporation shall have the right to direct that the liquidating payments otherwise payable to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be made to the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Section 7. 

   

 4. _Redemption_. 

  

 (a) The shares of Series A Preferred Stock are not redeemable prior to the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date, except as set forth in Section 4(j). After the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date, the Corporation, at its option, upon the giving of written notice as provided in 

    ##### 

  

    

Section 4(d) and subject to the receipt by the Corporation of prior approval
from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, if then required
under the capital guidelines or policies of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, may redeem shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, in
whole or from time to time in part, for cash at a redemption price per
share (the "Redemption Price") equal to $10,000 per share, plus (i) all
accrued but unpaid dividends for the then current Dividend Period (whether or
not earned or declared) to, but excluding, the date such shares shall be
considered redeemed (the "Redemption Date") and (ii) all accrued but
unpaid dividends that have been declared with respect to one or more prior
Dividend Periods (but without accumulation of any previously undeclared and
unpaid dividends for prior Dividend Periods). The Corporation may redeem
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or from time to time
in part, pursuant to the exercise of its setoff rights as set forth in
Section 7. 

   

 If any Redemption Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then such Redemption Date shall be the next succeeding Business Day, and no additional dividends shall accrue on the related payment as a result of such delay. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 4(j), the Redemption Price for shares of Series A Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall be paid by the Corporation in immediately available funds against presentation and surrender of such shares at a place specified for such purpose in the notice described in Section 4(d), and such shares shall thereupon be canceled; provided, however, that if such Redemption Date falls after a Dividend Record Date and on or prior to the related Dividend Payment Date, then the dividends payable on such Dividend Payment Date shall be paid to the holders of record on the close of business on such Dividend Record Date notwithstanding the redemption thereof on such Redemption Date or the Corporations default in the payment of such dividends on such Dividend Payment Date. 

   

 (c) If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed in accordance with Section 4(a), the shares to be redeemed shall be redeemed pro rata (including fractional shares as may be applicable) from all holders of Series A Preferred Stock. If fewer than all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock represented by any certificate therefor are to be redeemed, the Corporation shall issue without charge to the holder thereof a new certificate representing the shares of Series A Preferred Stock not so redeemed. 

   

 (d) Notice of redemption will be mailed by the Corporation or its agent, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days immediately preceding the applicable Redemption Date, to the holders of record of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses appearing in the stock records of the Corporation, and to any transfer agent for the shares. In addition to any information required by law, each written notice shall state: (i) the applicable Redemption Date; (ii) the Redemption Price; (iii) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all of the shares of a particular holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed; (iv) the place or places where the holders of Series A Preferred Stock may present and surrender their shares for payment of the Redemption Price; and (v) that dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to accrue on such Redemption Date. 

    ##### 

  

  

 (e) At its election, the Corporation may, prior to the applicable Redemption Date, irrevocably deposit the Redemption Price for the shares of Series A Preferred Stock designated for redemption in trust with a bank or trust company that is not affiliated with the Corporation, in which case the notice of redemption to holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall: (i) state the date of such deposit, (ii) specify the office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the Redemption Price and (iii) require such holders to present and surrender their related shares at such place on such Redemption Date against payment of the Redemption Price therefor. Any monies so deposited which remain unclaimed at the end of two years after the Redemption Date shall be returned by the bank or trust company to the Corporation, and after the return of such monies, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall look solely to the Corporation for payment of the Redemption Price without interest. 

   

 (f) Notice having been mailed in accordance with Section 4(d), from and after the applicable Redemption Date (unless the Corporation defaults in payment of the Redemption Price), all dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall cease to accrue and all rights of the holders thereof, except the right to receive the Redemption Price therefor, shall terminate with respect to such shares, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the Corporations stock records (except with the consent of the Corporation) or be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, unless full dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid for the then current Dividend Period, (i) no shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed and (ii) the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 

   

 (h) Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock that have been redeemed by the Corporation shall, after such redemption, have the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock, without designation as to series, until once more designated as part of a particular series of Preferred Stock by the Board of Directors. 

   

 (i) The Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to the benefit of, or be subject to, any sinking fund and shall not be subject to mandatory redemption or redemption at the option of the holders thereof. 

   

 (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Corporation shall have the right to direct that the Redemption Price otherwise payable to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be paid to the Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Section 7\. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be redeemable prior to the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date only in the event the Corporation is entitled to exercise its setoff rights as set forth in Section 7, subject to prior approval of any governmental authority having regulatory jurisdiction over the Corporation. 

   

 5. _Voting Rights_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights, except as required by law or as set forth herein. 

   

 (b) Whenever full dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall not have been paid for the immediately preceding three consecutive calendar quarters and thereafter until the Corporation has paid full dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for 12 consecutive calendar quarters (a "Preferred Dividend Default") the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock (voting as a single class) shall be entitled to elect two additional directors (the "Preferred Stock Directors") to the Board of Directors at a special meeting called by the holders of record of at least 10% of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 calendar days before the date fixed for the next annual meeting of stockholders) or, if the request for a special meeting is received by the Corporation less than 90 calendar days before the date fixed for the next annual meeting of stockholders, at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each subsequent annual meeting if a Preferred Dividend Default then exists. Upon election, the Preferred Stock Directors shall become directors of the Corporation and the authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall thereupon automatically be increased by two. 

   

 (c) A Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the vote or consent of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote or consent of, the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock then having the voting rights set forth in Section 5(b) voting as a single class. Any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director may be filled by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock then having the voting rights set forth in Section 5(b) voting as a single class. Each Preferred Stock Director shall be entitled to one vote on any matter considered by the Board of Directors. 

   

 (d) On any matter in which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote (as expressly provided herein or as may be required by law), including any action by written consent, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote and a plurality of the voting power of such stock shall determine any such matter. 

   

 (e) When a Preferred Dividend Default no longer exists, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be divested of the voting rights set forth in Section 5(b) and the term of office of the Preferred Stock Directors elected pursuant to Section 5(b) shall terminate (subject to revesting in the event of each and every Preferred Dividend Default). 

   

 (f) The Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of record of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting, (i) authorize, create or issue, or increase the authorized, created or issued amount of, any class or series of the Corporations equity securities ranking, as to dividends or upon liquidation, on a parity with or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock, or reclassify any authorized class or series of equity securities of the Corporation into any such equity securities, or authorize, create or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such equity securities or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation (including this Statement of Designations, Rights, Preferences and Limitations), whether by merger or 

    ##### 

  

    

consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any
right, preference, privilege or voting power of the Series A Preferred
Stock. 

   

 (g) The foregoing voting provisions shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the action with respect to which such vote or consent would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and funds sufficient to effect such redemption shall have been irrevocably deposited in trust for the holders thereof with a bank or trust company that is not affiliated with the Corporation. 

   

 6. _Conversion_. 

  

 (a) The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may convert such shares, at the option of the holder, in whole or in part, into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock on the first day of any calendar quarter following the tenth anniversary of the Issue Date. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock at a ratio of eighty (80) shares of Common Stock for every one share of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Conversion Rate"). The Conversion Rate shall be subject to proportional adjustment for stock splits, reverse splits and similar transactions undertaken by the Corporation; provided, however, that, following the Issue Date, the Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted or otherwise increased or decreased based on the increase or decrease in the fair market value of the Common Stock or the credit standing of the Corporation. 

   

 (b) Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office, of the election to convert all or a portion of the Series A Preferred Stock and shall state the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees of such holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled. 

   

 (c) Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Common Stock, he shall execute and deliver to the Corporation a shareholder agreement as the Corporation may request at the time of conversion provided such agreement is substantially similar in form and substance to the form of shareholder agreement then being used by the Corporation with other non-affiliated holders of the Common Stock. Such agreement may include, without limitation, restrictions upon the holders right to transfer shares, including the creation of an irrevocable right of first refusal in the Corporation, and provisions requiring the holder to transfer the shares to the Corporation in certain circumstances. Execution and delivery of a shareholder agreement by the holder pursuant to the foregoing shall be a condition precedent to the right to convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock. 

    ##### 

  

  

 7. _Corporation s Setoff Rights Regarding Indemnification Obligations_. 

  

 (a) Each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock, by its acceptance thereof, acknowledges and agrees that (i) a true and complete copy of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of September 18, 2007 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") by and between the Corporation and First Western Bancorp., Inc., a South Dakota corporation ("First Western"), has been received by or made available to such holder; (ii) First Western is liable for various indemnification obligations as set forth in Article 8.0 of the Stock Purchase Agreement; (iii) all shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, including any dividends (except as set forth herein and in the Stock Purchase Agreement), liquidating payments, redemption proceeds, distributions and other proceeds thereof, are subject to the indemnification obligations of First Western and the setoff rights of the Corporation under the Stock Purchase Agreement; and (iv) such holder may not be entitled to some or all of the dividends, liquidating payments, redemption proceeds, distributions and other proceeds of the Series A Preferred Stock in the event the Corporation exercises its setoff rights in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7\. Defined terms used in the Section 7 without definition herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. 

   

 (b) Each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock, by its acceptance thereof, grants to the Corporation a right of setoff against all dividends, distributions or other payments the Corporation may make on or with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock, whether in redemption or otherwise, for any obligation of First Western to indemnify the Corporation or any of its affiliates under the Stock Purchase Agreement. This right of setoff is in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other right or remedy available to the Corporation under the Stock Purchase Agreement, at law or in equity. 

   

 (c) First Western may, in its discretion, designate a liquidating trust or other entity for the benefit of the shareholders of First Western. Subject to the prior written consent of the Corporation, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, and all other transfer restrictions applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock, First Western may distribute all of the Series A Preferred Stock as soon as practicable following the Closing to the trustee of such trust (or other entity reasonably acceptable to the Corporation). Notwithstanding the distribution or transfer of any of the Series A Preferred Stock, with or without the consent of the Corporation, the Corporation shall be entitled to set-off against the Series A Preferred Stock, subject to the provisions of this Section 7, for any amounts due to it from First Western pursuant to the indemnification provisions of Article 8.0 of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Upon request of the Corporation, and as a condition to the Corporations consent, if any, to any transfer of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation may require any successor holder of the Series A Preferred Stock to execute and deliver such instruments and documents as the Corporation may reasonably request evidencing, among other things, the successors acknowledgement of the indemnification and setoff provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Corporation shall not be entitled to exercise its rights of set-off in respect of any Indemnification Demand until such time as either (i) First Western has agreed to pay such Indemnification Demand or (ii) such Indemnification Demand has been reduced to a final, non-appealable judgment in the case of a Third Party Claim or (iii) the amount of such Indemnification Demand has been otherwise   ##### 

  

  

  

resolved by arbitration or otherwise under the Stock Purchase Agreement. In
the event an Indemnification Demand is disputed in part by First Western,
each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock shall accept for set-off the
undisputed amount of such Indemnification Demand. The amount of any
Indemnification Demand that First Western agrees to pay or the amount of any
such Indemnification Demand determined by judgment or arbitration is referred
to herein as the "Set-Off Amount." 

   

 (e) Once a Set-Off Amount is so determined, the Corporation shall give First Western and the record holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, if different, written notice of at least five (5) business days of its intention to effectuate the set-off pursuant to this Section 7, which notice will specify in reasonable detail the basis for the set-off, the effective date of the set-off, the Set-Off Amount and the method of effecting the set-off in this Section 7(e). Such Set-Off Amount shall be made first by withdrawal of the Escrowed Dividends, if any; second by setoff against not more than seventy-five percent (75%) of any subsequent dividends or other distributions payable to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock; and, third by setoff against any liquidating payments payable to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Corporation may redeem, by written notice to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, that number of shares (and fractions thereof as applicable) of Series A Preferred Stock having a liquidation amount ($10,000.00 per share) equal to the remaining Set-Off Amount remaining unpaid at any time. Except as provided in the preceding sentences, nothing in this Section 7 shall relieve the Corporation from paying dividends when declared on the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof. Within ten (10) business days of the date of receipt of the notice of redemption, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall submit to the Corporation for cancellation certificates representing a liquidation amount of Series A Preferred Stock equal to or exceeding the Set-Off Amount. The Corporation shall promptly cause to be issued and delivered to the then holders certificates representing the excess shares (and fractions thereof as applicable) of the Series A Preferred Stock submitted, registered in the name of the then holders. The redemption of Series A Preferred Stock for the payment of a Set-Off Amount is within the sole discretion of the Corporation, subject to the prior approval of Regulators having jurisdiction over the Corporation. Nothing in the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock is intended, or shall be interpreted to require, the Corporation to redeem all or any portion of the Series A Preferred Stock at any time or under any circumstances. 

   

 (f) The maximum aggregate Set-Off Amount shall not exceed the sum of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00). No dividends previously paid prior to the date of an Indemnification Demand on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to set-off or recoupment. 

   

 (g) For so long as an Indemnification Demand is disputed, outstanding, unresolved, or unpaid, seventy-five percent (75%) of each dividend declared and paid on the Series A Preferred Stock (the "Escrowed Dividends") shall be paid by the Corporation to an escrow account to be established by the Corporation with Wells Fargo Bank, U.S. Bank, Zions Bank or, if none of the foregoing banks are willing or able to serve as escrow agent, a bank selected by the Corporation with capital in excess of $1.0 billion and not then affiliated with the Corporation (the "Escrow Agent") to be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in United States Treasury obligations (or such other investments as directed from time to time by the joint   ##### 

  

  

  

written instructions of the Corporation and First Western to the Escrow
Agent), and the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of each such dividend
shall be paid to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Escrow
Agent shall distribute the Escrowed Dividends and any and all earnings
thereon to the Corporation or the holders when and to the extent that such
Indemnification Demand is resolved in accordance with the joint written
instructions of the Corporation and First Western. Income taxes due on
amounts earned on the Escrowed Dividends shall be payable by the parties
entitled to such Escrowed Dividends in the proportions ultimately distributed
to them. The Corporation shall furnish First Western and the then holders of
the Series A Preferred Stock, if different, with a copy of the escrow
agreement for review and comment before it is executed and with a signed copy
of the escrow agreement when it is executed. 

   

 (h) For purposes of any Corporation notice and other obligations hereunder, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be the Person or Persons registered as the legal owner of the Series A Preferred Stock upon the Corporations books and records. 

   

 8. _Exclusion of Other Rights_. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions other than those specifically set forth in this Statement of Designations, Rights, Preferences and Limitations. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have the benefit of, and shall not be subject to, any preemptive or similar rights. 

  

 9. _Headings_. Headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of any of the provisions hereof. 

  

 10. _Severability of Provisions_. If any preference, right, voting power, restriction, limitation as to dividends or other distributions, qualification or other term or condition of the Series A Preferred Stock is invalid, unlawful or incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of law or public policy, all other preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and other terms or conditions of the Series A Preferred Stock which can be given effect without the invalid, unlawful or unenforceable provision thereof shall, nevertheless, remain in full force and effect, and no preference, right, voting power, restriction, limitation as to dividends or other distributions, qualification or other term or condition of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed dependent upon any other provision thereof unless so expressed therein. 

  

 11. _Restrictions on Transfer_. 

  

 (a) Neither the Series A Preferred Stock nor the Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof (collectively, the "Securities") have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and, until so registered, may not be offered or sold except in a transaction exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Additional restrictions on the sale or transfer of the Securities are set forth herein. 

   

 (b) Except with the prior written consent of the Corporation, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and provided First Western has complied with all transfer   ##### 

  

  

  

restrictions applicable to the Series A Preferred Stock, prior to the full and
final satisfaction of, and termination of, the indemnification obligations of
First Western under the Stock Purchase Agreement and the satisfaction of all
Set-Off Amounts, neither First Western nor any permitted successor shall
sell, assign, transfer, pledge, grant a security interest in or
otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in or to the Securities,
including, without limitation, any distribution by First Western or any
permitted successor to or for the benefit of any First Western shareholder.
Without limiting the foregoing, as a condition to the consent of the
Corporation, the Corporation may in its discretion require any transferee or
other successor to First Western in or to the Securities to execute and
deliver documents or instruments necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Corporation (i) for the compliance with any law, rule or regulation,
including, without limitation, applicable federal and state securities laws,
or (ii) relating to the right of setoff or other remedy of the Corporation
with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock as set forth in Section 7. 

   

 (c) Except as set forth in Section 11(b), no holder of the Series A Preferred Stock may sell, assign, transfer, pledge, grant a security interest in or otherwise dispose of any right, title or interest in or to the Securities. 

   

 (d) Unless and until shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are registered under the Securities Act, prior to (i) the date that is two years (or such shorter period of time specified in Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act) after the later of the date of original issuance of the applicable shares and the last date on which the Corporation or any Affiliate (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Corporation was the owner of such shares and (ii) such later date, if any, as may be required by applicable law, all certificates representing the Securities, and any securities issued in respect thereof or exchange therefore, shall bear the following legend and be subject to the restrictions specified therein:
