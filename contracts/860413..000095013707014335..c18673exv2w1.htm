Closing to the trustee of such trust (or other entity reasonably acceptable to FIBS).
Notwithstanding the distribution or transfer of any of the Preferred Stock, with or without

non-appealable judgment in the case of a Third Party Claim or (iii)&nbsp;the amount of such
Indemnification Demand has been otherwise resolved by arbitration or otherwise under this
Agreement. In the event an Indemnification Demand is disputed in part by First Western,
First Western agrees to approve for set-off the undisputed amount of such Indemnification

conditions required under Federal Reserve regulations and policy statements generally applicable to
bank holding companies for qualification as Tier 1 capital, including, without limitation, Federal
Reserve Regulation&nbsp;Y, Appendix&nbsp;A. The preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and other terms and conditions
of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock are as follows:

annum equal to 6.75% of the liquidation preference thereof from, and including, <B>&#091;date of issue&#093;</B>
(the &#147;Issue Date&#148;). Such dividends shall be payable quarterly in arrears on January&nbsp;1, April&nbsp;1,

Period (as defined below); provided, however, that if any Dividend Payment Date other than a
Redemption Date (as defined in Section&nbsp;4(a)) falls on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined
below), then any dividends payable shall be paid on, and such Dividend Payment Date shall be moved
to, the next succeeding Business Day, and additional dividends shall accrue for each day such
payment is delayed as a result thereof. Dividends declared in respect of a Dividend Payment Date
shall be payable to the holders of record of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock appearing in the stock
records of the Corporation at the close of business on the applicable record date (whether or not a
Business Day), which shall be a date designated by the Board of Directors for the payment of
dividends that is not less than 10 nor more than 60 calendar days immediately preceding such

September&nbsp;18, 2007 (the &#147;Stock Purchase Agreement&#148;) by and between the Corporation and First
Western Bancorp., Inc., a South Dakota corporation (&#147;First Western&#148;), has been received by or made

accordance with the provisions of this Section&nbsp;7. Defined terms used in the Section&nbsp;7 without

Agreement, at law or in equity.

has been reduced to a final, non-appealable judgment in the case of a Third Party Claim or (iii)

Set-Off Amount and the method of effecting the set-off in this Section&nbsp;7(e). Such Set-Off Amount

foregoing, the Corporation may redeem, by written notice to the holders of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred
Stock, that number of shares (and fractions thereof as applicable) of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock
having a liquidation amount ($10,000.00 per share) equal to the remaining Set-Off Amount remaining
unpaid at any time. Except as provided in the preceding sentences, nothing in this Section&nbsp;7 shall
relieve the Corporation from paying dividends when declared on the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof. Within ten (10)&nbsp;business days of the date of receipt of the
notice of redemption, the holders of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock shall submit to the Corporation
for cancellation certificates representing a liquidation amount of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock equal
to or exceeding the Set-Off Amount. The Corporation shall promptly cause to be issued and
delivered to the then holders certificates representing the excess shares (and fractions thereof as
applicable) of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock submitted, registered in the name of the then holders.
The redemption of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock for the payment of a Set-Off Amount is within the sole
discretion of the Corporation, subject to the prior approval of Regulators having jurisdiction over
the Corporation. Nothing in the terms of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock is intended, or shall be
