following receipt of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement to review the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and to notify Buyer in writing if it disputes
any of the items set forth on the Preliminary Adjustment Statement (the
"Disagreement Notice") which shall include (i) the items of the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement with which Sellers disagree; (ii) the adjustments that
Sellers propose to be made to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement (a
"Disputed Item"); and (iii) the specific amount of such disagreement and
reasonable supporting documentation and calculations thereof. Any items as to
which there is no disagreement shall be deemed agreed. In connection with
Sellers' review of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, Sellers and their
respective Representatives shall have reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to all relevant work papers,
schedules and other supporting documents prepared by Buyer or its
Representatives and used in connection 

with its calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash Amounts and Closing Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount and to
finance personnel and accountants of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and any other
information which Sellers reasonably request, and Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Representatives to, cooperate reasonably with Sellers and their respective
Representatives in connection therewith. In the event that Sellers deliver a
Disagreement Notice to Buyer, Buyer may, within ten (10) Business Days of such
Disagreement Notice and only with respect to any Disputed Item or item related
to a Disputed Item, supplement or revise its position, and deliver an updated
Preliminary Adjustment Statement to Sellers. Any line items so supplemented or
revised would also be deemed Disputed Items if Sellers disagree in writing
with Buyer's supplemented or revised position on such line items within ten
(10) Business Days after delivery to Sellers of such supplemental or revised
items.

(d) In the event that Sellers deliver a Disagreement Notice to Buyer, Buyer
and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly
as practicable and, upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and/or the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash Amounts and Closing
Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount shall be made in writing in accordance with
the agreement of Buyer and Sellers. If Sellers do not deliver a Disagreement
Notice to Buyer before the expiration of the Review Period, effective as of
12:01 a.m., New York City Time, on the day immediately following the last day
of the Review Period, the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash Amounts and Closing Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount, as
applicable, as shown in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall become
final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and shall constitute the
"Final Net Working Capital", "Final Indebtedness", "Final Cash Amounts" and
"Final Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount", respectively, for purposes of
Section 2.4(h) and Section 2.4(j).

(e) If Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve any Disputed Items within
twenty (20) Business Days or such longer period as Buyer and Sellers shall
mutually agree in writing after Sellers' delivery of the Disagreement Notice
(the "Resolution Period"), such Disputed Items shall be promptly submitted to
Grant Thornton LLP, or if such firm is not able or willing to serve in such
capacity, to a mutually acceptable nationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants that has not provided material services to either
Sellers or Buyer or their respective Affiliates in the preceding three years,
or if no such firm is available and willing to serve, then a mutually
acceptable expert in public accounting, in each case, upon which Buyer and
Sellers shall have mutually agreed (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). If the
parties are unable to agree on the Independent Accounting Firm within fifteen
(15) days following the expiration of the Resolution Period, either party may
request the President of the American Arbitration Association to appoint a
senior partner in a nationally recognized accounting firm to serve as the
Independent Accounting Firm.

(f) If any remaining Disputed Items (the "Unresolved Items") are submitted to
the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, each of Buyer and Sellers
shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the
other party on the same day), within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may
include supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the
Unresolved Items. Each of 

Buyer and Sellers may (but shall not be required to) submit to the Independent
Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other party on the same day),
within twenty (20) Business Days after the date of the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to the initial memorandum
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by the other party. Unless
requested by the Independent Accounting Firm in writing, no party hereto may
present any additional information or arguments to the Independent Accounting
Firm, either orally or in writing. The Independent Accounting Firm shall not
review any line items or make any determination with respect to any matter
other than with respect to Unresolved Items. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall be given reasonable access to all relevant records of the Business to
calculate the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
Amounts and Closing Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount, as applicable.

(g) The Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator to calculate, based solely on the written submissions of Buyer, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, and not by independent
investigation, the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash Amounts and Closing Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount, as applicable,
and shall be instructed that its calculation (i) must be made in accordance
with the requirements of this Agreement, including the Transaction Accounting
Principles, and (ii) with respect to each Unresolved Item, must be within the
range of values established for such amount as determined by reference to the
value assigned to such amount by Sellers in the Disagreement Notice and by
Buyer in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall submit such verification and calculation to Sellers and Buyer as soon as
practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the Unresolved
Items are submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. Except for any dispute
to the extent relating to any interpretation of Law or terms of this Agreement
(other than Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
Amounts and Closing Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount, as applicable, its
constituent definitions and this ARTICLE II), the determination by the
Independent Accounting Firm of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash Amounts and Closing Section 338(h)(10) Election
Amount, as applicable, as set forth in a written notice delivered to Buyer and
Sellers by the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with this Agreement
shall be, absent Fraud or manifest error, binding and conclusive on Buyer and
Sellers.

(h) (i) The Closing Net Working Capital as determined after all disputes have
been resolved in accordance with this Section 2.4 is referred to herein as the
"Final Net Working Capital", (ii) the Closing Indebtedness as determined after
all disputes have been resolved in accordance with this Section 2.4 is
referred to herein as the "Final Indebtedness", (iii) the Closing Cash Amounts
as determined after all disputes have been resolved in accordance with this
Section 2.4 is referred to herein as the "Final Cash Amounts" and (iv) the
Closing Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount, as determined after all disputes
have been resolved in accordance with this Section 2.4 and as adjusted, as
necessary, to reflect the Final Net Working Capital, Final Indebtedness and
Final Cash Amounts, is referred to herein as the "Final Section 338(h)(10)
Election Amount." 

(i) Buyer and Sellers agree that the procedures set forth in this Section 2.4
for resolving disputes with respect to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
and the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Cash Amounts and Closing Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount, as
applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; provided that this provision shall not prohibit any party from
instituting litigation to enforce any decision pursuant to the terms hereof by
the Independent Accounting Firm in any court of competent jurisdiction;
provided, further, that with respect to the Closing Section 338(h)(10)
Election Amount, in the event of any conflict between this Section 2.4(i)
(insofar as it relates to the Closing Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount) and
Section 5.16, Section 5.16 shall control. The substance of the Independent
Accounting Firm's determination shall not be subject to review or appeal,
absent a showing of fraud or manifest error. It is the intent of the parties
to have any determination of Unresolved Items by the Independent Accounting
Firm proceed in an expeditious manner; provided, however, that any deadline or
time period contained herein may be extended or modified by agreement of the
parties and the parties agree that the failure of the Independent Accounting
Firm to strictly conform to any deadline or time period contained herein shall
not be a basis for seeking to overturn any determination rendered by the
Independent Accounting Firm. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer and Sellers based on
the inverse of the percentage that the Independent Accounting Firm's
determination (before such allocation) of the amount awarded to each party
bears to the total amount of the total Disputed Items as originally submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm. For example, if Sellers claim that the
Closing Net Working Capital is $1,000 greater than the amount claimed by
Buyer, if Buyer contests only $500 of such amount claimed by Sellers and if
the Independent Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding
Sellers $300 of the $500 so contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of
the Independent Accounting Firm will be allocated sixty percent (60%) (i.e.,
300 ÷ 500) to Buyer and forty percent (40%) (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Sellers. Any
fees, costs, and expenses allocated to and to be borne by Buyer or Sellers
pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be paid by such party, or its
designee, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of any invoice or bill for
such fees, costs and expenses.

(j) The final purchase price (the "Final Purchase Price") shall be an amount
in cash equal to the Base Price, (i) plus the Final Net Working Capital
Adjustment, (ii) minus the Final Indebtedness, (iii) plus the Final Cash
Amounts and (iv) minus, if applicable, the Final Section 338(h)(10) Election
Amount. The difference (either positive or negative) between the Initial
Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price is referred to as the "Final
Closing Adjustment", and the Final Closing Adjustment shall be determined by
subtracting the Initial Purchase Price from the Final Purchase Price.

(k) Buyer (if the Final Closing Adjustment is a positive number) or Sellers
(if the Final Closing Adjustment is a negative number), as the case may be,
shall, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final
Closing Adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.4, make payment to the other
(or, in the case of a payment by Buyer, to Sellers or one or more of Sellers'
respective designees identified in writing to Buyer prior to Closing) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
the other an amount equal to the absolute value of the Final Closing
Adjustment as determined pursuant to this Section 2.4. 



Section 2.5 Casualty Loss.

(a) No later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing, Sellers shall
provide Buyer a list of any Retail Site that contributed revenue to 2019 or
2020 operations of the Business (other than any Retail Sites permanently
closed prior to December 31, 2019 and any Planned Closing Retail Sites) (i)
which has been damaged or destroyed at any time after December 31, 2018 and on
or prior to such date by fire, theft, vandalism, flood, wind, hurricane,

Closing Retail Sites) (i) which has been damaged or destroyed at any time
after December 31, 2018 and on or prior to the Closing Date (the portion of
any Retail Site so damaged or destroyed, the "Damaged Retail Site") whether by
fire, theft, vandalism, flood, wind, hurricane, explosion, lightning storm,
hail, subversion, earthquake, act of God, act of terrorism or other causality
(such event, a "Casualty Event") and (ii) the repairs and restoration of which
were not completed on or before the Closing Date. The Casualty Event Notice
shall include (i) a reasonable description of the facts and circumstances
surrounding the Casualty Event, (ii) Sellers' preliminary assessment of the
effect of the Casualty Event on the relevant Retail Site, including the
estimated dollar amount of the Casualty Loss Amount and the portion of such
Casualty Loss Amount actually paid by Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries prior
to Closing to repair or restore such Damaged Retail Site, (iii) the date upon
which each such Damaged Retail Site sustained a Casualty Event and (iv) the
status of repair and restoration of each Damaged Retail Site.

(c) With respect to each Damaged Retail Site, Seller Parent shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) repair and restore such Damaged Retail Site,
including making any required expenditures, in the Ordinary Course of
Business. With respect to each Damaged Retail Site (i) that has been damaged
or destroyed by a Casualty Event before the Closing resulting in damages in
excess of $25,000 individually (a "Casualty Loss Adjustment Site") and (ii)
the repairs and restoration of which has not been completed on or before the
Closing Date, promptly following the determination of the aggregate Casualty
Loss Amount for the Casualty Loss Adjustment Sites, Sellers shall pay, on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day after the Closing Date, to Buyer as an
advancement of expenses for each Casualty Loss Adjustment Site: (x) the
applicable Casualty Loss Amount less (y) the portion of such Casualty Loss
Amount actually paid by Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries prior to Closing to
repair or restore such Casualty Loss Adjustment Site.

(d) With respect to each Damaged Retail Site that has been damaged or
destroyed by a Casualty Event prior to the Closing such that either the front
court or back court of the Damaged Retail Site is not operational and closed
as of the Closing Date (including, in the event of any Casualty Event
impacting a Leased Real Property, (i) if the applicable landlord has 

the right to terminate the applicable Real Property Lease as a result thereof
(and such right has not been exercised or waived and the time period, if any,
for exercising such right has not expired and does not expire prior to the
Closing) and (ii) if the applicable landlord validly exercises a right to
terminate the applicable Real Property Lease as a result thereof prior to
Closing), promptly following the determination of the Casualty Loss Amount,
Sellers shall pay, on or before the forty-fifth (45th) day after the Closing
Date, to Buyer for each such closed Damaged Retail Site an amount equal to the
sum of (x) the applicable Casualty Loss Amount less the portion of such
Casualty Loss Amount actually paid by Seller Parent or its Subsidiaries prior
to Closing to repair or restore such Damaged Retail Site and (y) (i) the
average monthly EBITDA generated by such Damaged Retail Site for all full
calendar months in which such Damaged Retail Site was fully operational during
the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately preceding the date of such
Casualty Loss Amount multiplied by (ii) the number of months (or fraction
thereof) required to repair and restore such Damaged Retail Site (provided
that in no event shall such estimated period pursuant to this clause (y)
exceed twelve (12) months).

(e) With respect to any Casualty Loss Adjustment Site, Sellers shall promptly
submit to Buyer a reasonably detailed summary of the plan to repair or restore
any such Damaged Retail Site not repaired or restored prior to Closing,
including a good faith estimate of the cost to repair such damage by a
reputable independent third party who is selected by Sellers and is reasonably
approved by Buyer.

(f) With respect to any Casualty Loss Adjustment Site, such Casualty Loss
Adjustment Site and the Casualty Event relating thereto shall have no effect
for purposes of determining whether Buyer's conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 6.2 have been fulfilled.

ARTICLE III

Except as set forth on (a) the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents filed by Seller Parent with, or furnished to, the SEC, with respect

respect to the Closing Date, following January 1, 2019, and publicly available
(excluding any disclosures contained or references therein under the captions
"Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" and any other disclosures
contained therein relating to information, factors or risks that are general,
forward-looking or cautionary statements) solely to the extent of disclosures
in such reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents where it is
readily apparent on its face to apply to the Business, the Acquired Assets or
Assumed Liabilities, or (b) the Seller Disclosure Schedule, each of Seller
Parent and each Seller, as applicable, severally and jointly, represents and
warrants to Buyer as of the Signing Date and as of the Closing Date as follows
(it being understood that the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty contained in this ARTICLE III is not intended to
imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material
for purposes of this Agreement):

Section 3.1 Due Organization and Good Standing. Seller Parent, each Seller and
each Acquired Entity is, or, solely with respect to any Acquired Entity formed
after the Signing Date 

pursuant to the terms of Section 5.7, if any, will be as of the Closing, duly
organized and validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing (to the
extent such concept is legally recognized under the laws of the jurisdiction
of its organization or formation) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization or formation, except as would not individually or in the
aggregate reasonably be expected to be material to the Business. Each of
Seller Parent and each Seller is, and each Acquired Entity is, or will be as
of the Closing, qualified or otherwise authorized to act as a foreign
corporation and, where applicable, is or will be, as the case may be, in good
standing (to the extent such concept is legally recognized under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its organization or formation) under the Laws of every
other jurisdiction in which the ownership, leasing or operation of the
Acquired Assets, or the conduct of the Business, requires such qualification
or authorization under applicable Law, except where the failure to be so
qualified or otherwise authorized or in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has not initiated
any Action for the dissolution, liquidation or insolvency of any Seller or
Acquired Entity. Each Seller (solely with respect to the Business) has, and
the Acquired Entities will have as of the Closing (but without giving effect
to the Sale), the requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own,
lease and operate the Acquired Assets and to carry on the conduct of the
Business as now conducted, except as would not individually or in the
aggregate reasonably be expected to be material to the Business.

Seller has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and
each other agreement, document and instrument to be executed and delivered by

transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller Parent and each Seller of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and each other agreement, document and instrument to be executed
and delivered by Seller Parent or such Seller pursuant hereto or thereto and
the consummation by Seller Parent or such Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Seller Parent or such Seller and no
other corporate acts or proceedings on the part of Seller Parent or such
Seller are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by
Seller Parent or such Seller of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and
each other agreement, document and instrument to be executed and delivered by
such Seller pursuant hereto or thereto or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Seller Parent and each Seller and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Buyer and each other party hereto, constitutes, and
each Ancillary Agreement (to the extent Seller Parent or such Seller is a
party thereto), when executed and delivered by Seller Parent or such Seller
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
thereto) shall constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller
Parent or such Seller, enforceable against Seller Parent or such Seller in
accordance with its terms, except that such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws now
or hereafter in effect affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and
general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in
equity) (collectively, the "Bankruptcy and Equity Principles").

existing or outstanding that provide a right to vote the Equity Interests of
any Acquired Entity (or are convertible into, or exchangeable for, Equity
Interests of any Acquired Entity having the right to vote) or provide for the
sale or issuance of any Equity Interest of, or any other equity interest in,
any Acquired Entity (other than this Agreement and the Organizational
Documents of the Acquired Entities). Except for this Agreement, there are no
outstanding rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of
any kind (whether conditional or not) obligating the issuance, sale, transfer,

the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance by
Seller Parent and each Seller (and, with respect to any applicable Ancillary

or cancel (i) any term or provision of the Organizational Documents of Seller
Parent, any Seller or any Acquired Entity, (ii) any Permit or (iii) any
Material Contract; or (c) result in the creation of any Encumbrance (other
than Permitted Encumbrances) on the Acquired Company Interests or any Acquired

such matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Business.

each Seller (and its Subsidiaries) shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and subject to Buyer's right to consent or
withhold consent with respect to the foregoing matters, complete control and
supervision of the operations of the Business. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that nothing
in this Section 5.1 shall be deemed to limit the transfer of the Excluded
Assets or the Retained Liabilities prior to, at or after the Closing.

Section 5.2 Employment Matters.

(a) Employment.

(i) The employment of each Business Employee who is employed as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time by an Acquired Entity shall continue 

uninterrupted immediately following the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing
Date, each Seller shall take all actions necessary to (A) transfer the
employment of each Business Employee who is not otherwise employed by an
Acquired Entity to an Acquired Entity, and (B) transfer the employment of each
employee who is not a Business Employee from an Acquired Entity to a Seller or
an Affiliate of any Seller (other than an Acquired Entity).

(ii) If, despite its reasonable best efforts, any Seller identifies, after the
Closing Date (but no later than three (3) months after the Closing Date), a
Business Employee who was inadvertently not transferred to an Acquired Entity
prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer of such fact,
and, to the extent Buyer consents and, in its sole discretion, determines is
appropriate, Buyer shall, or shall cause an Acquired Entity to, offer
employment to such Business Employee as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, and the employment of such Business Employee with Buyer shall
commence upon the date on which such individual actually commences employment
with Buyer.

(iii) All Business Employees whose employment continues with or transfers to
Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.2 (including those referred in Section
5.2(a)(ii)) are collectively referred to herein as "Transferred Employees".

(iv) The Acquired Entities (or in the case of a transfer following the
Closing, Buyer or its Affiliates) shall, effective as of the date of a
Transferred Employee's employment by an Acquired Entity (or for a transfer
following the Closing, Buyer or its Affiliates), assume or retain all
Liabilities and obligations related to the employment and the continuation or
discontinuation of employment of each Transferred Employee, and the terms and
conditions of employment of all Transferred Employees, regardless of whether
such Liability or obligation occurs prior to, on or after the Closing.

(b) Collective Bargaining Agreements. Buyer will take all necessary action to
assume the Business CBAs effective as of the Closing (and after such date
shall continue to comply with the terms of the Business CBAs) and shall assume
or shall cause the Acquired Entities to retain all obligations under the
Business CBAs, regardless of whether such obligation arises or relates to
events occurring prior to, on or after the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing,
if reasonably requested by Buyer, Sellers and/or Seller Parent shall cooperate
with Buyer to assist Buyer in its negotiations with the unions party to the
Business CBAs to the extent required by Law to allow for the implementation of
the covenants contained in this Section 5.2.

(c) Compensation and Benefits Continuation Generally.

(i) General. The Acquired Entity Plans shall continue uninterrupted
immediately following the Closing Date, and Buyer shall honor, assume, fulfill
and discharge the Liabilities and obligations under all Acquired Entity Plans
in accordance with the terms of such Acquired Entity Plans. Except as
otherwise provided for under the terms of any Seller Plan, Sellers shall take
all necessary actions to cause the Transferred Employees to cease, effective
as of no later than the Closing Date, any active 

participation in (including eligibility to contribute to) and any benefit
accrual under any and all Seller Plans. Sellers and such Seller Plans shall
retain any Liability or obligation under Seller Plans with respect to benefits
accrued or benefit claims incurred by Transferred Employees prior to the
Closing Date, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.2. With respect
to Transferred Employees who are not represented by a labor union or otherwise
covered by the terms of a CBA, until at least one year after the Closing Date
(or such longer period required by applicable Law) (the "Continuation
Period"), Buyer and its Affiliates shall provide to each Transferred Employee
(A) a base salary or base wage rate and incentive compensation opportunity, in
each case that is no less than that in effect for such Transferred Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
any equity and equity-based compensation and any Protection Awards), (B)
employee and fringe benefits (other than retirement benefits under a defined
benefit pension plan and severance benefits) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such Transferred Employee immediately prior
to the Closing Date under the applicable Seller Plans and Acquired Entity
Plans, or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and (C) with respect to any
severance eligible termination of employment (as determined under the
applicable Seller Plan or Acquired Entity Plan identified in Section 5.2(c)(i)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule applicable to such Transferred Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Applicable Severance Plan"))
occurring during the Continuation Period, severance pay and benefits that are
no less favorable than the severance pay and benefits that would have been
provided to such Transferred Employee under the Applicable Severance Plan,
taking into account such Business Employee's additional period of service and
increases (but not decreases) in compensation following the Closing; provided,
that this Section 5.2(c)(i)(C) shall not apply to any Transferred Employee who
is subject to a Protection Award. In addition, the Acquired Entity Plan that
provides post-retirement healthcare benefits shall be maintained, without
amendment except as required by applicable Law or a Business CBA, until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date

(ii) Service Credit. Buyer shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to,
recognize all service of the Transferred Employees who are not represented by
a labor union or otherwise covered by the terms of a Business CBA with the
Business, the Acquired Entities, Sellers and all of their current or former
Affiliates that are recognized under any Seller Plan applicable to service-
related or measured entitlements under applicable Law (collectively, the
"Service Credits"). Buyer shall take Service Credits into account for purposes
of determining, as applicable, the eligibility for participation, vesting and
level of benefits (but excluding benefit accruals and participation
eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan and any post-retirement
medical plan that is not an Acquired Entity Plan) under any employee benefit
plan established or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates under which any
Transferred Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Closing
Date to the same extent recognized by the applicable Seller under comparable
Seller Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.2(c) shall be construed to require
crediting of service that would result in a duplication of benefits for the
same period of service. 

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.2(c), nothing
in this Section 5.2(c) shall apply to any Business Employees who are subject
to the Business CBAs, for whom the terms of the Business CBAs shall govern
with respect to the subject matters in this Section 5.2(c), including, but not
limited to, honoring such covered Transferred Employees' seniority, past
service, accrued vacation, sick leave and personal time off consistent with
the terms of the Business CBAs and applicable Law.

(d) Pre-Existing Conditions. To the extent that any Business Employee
participates in any health or other group welfare plan of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates following the Closing Date, Buyer shall: (i) waive any limitation
on healthcare and other welfare benefit coverage of Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions under any applicable
healthcare and welfare benefit plans of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, to the
extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the Transferred Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to credit Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents with all payments credited against out-of-pocket maximums and
deductible payments and co-payments paid by such person, in each case, under
the healthcare plans of the applicable Seller or its Affiliates prior to the
Closing Date during the year in which the Closing occurs (or, if later, prior
to the first date of participation during the year in which such participation
first commences) for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such
person has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached
the out-of-pocket maximum under any healthcare plan of Buyer or an Affiliate
of Buyer for such year.

(e) Speedway Retirement Plan. With respect to the Speedway Retirement Plan,
(i) on or promptly following the Signing Date, Sellers shall cause the
Speedway Retirement Plan to be closed to new entrants, including re-hires
(i.e., with respect to the resumption of benefit accruals) and (ii) prior to
the Closing, Sellers shall take all necessary action to cause sponsorship of
the Speedway Retirement Plan to be transferred to a Seller or an Affiliate of
Sellers (other than any Acquired Entity). No later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Sellers' external actuary shall, after consultation with
Buyer's actuary, determine (i) all liabilities under the Speedway Retirement
Plan as of the last day of the calendar quarter ending at least one (1) month
prior to the Closing calculated on PBGC plan termination basis and (ii) the
actual value of the Assets held in the Seller Master Trust that are
attributable to the Speedway Retirement Plan based on the information
available as of the last day of such calendar quarter, and the sum of (A)
fifty percent (50%) of the excess of clause (i) over clause (ii), plus (B)
$500,000 (such sum, the "Speedway Retirement Plan Sharing Amount") shall
reduce Indebtedness dollar for dollar.

(f) Defined Contribution Plans.

(i) The Speedway Sub-Plan. On or as soon as reasonably practicable (and no
later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date), Buyer shall provide
that each Transferred Employee who is eligible to participate in the Speedway
Retirement Savings Sub-Plan (the "RSSP") under the Marathon Petroleum Thrift
Plan, as amended from time to time (the "Seller Thrift Plan"), shall be
eligible to participate in an 

"eligible retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code) of Buyer or one of its Affiliates (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan") and each
such Transferred Employee shall be given the option to receive a distribution
of his or her account balance under the RSSP and, in accordance with
applicable Law, elect to roll over such amount, including any notes
corresponding to outstanding Loans, into the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

(ii) Transferred Employees Participating in the Seller Component of the Seller
Thrift Plan. With respect to Transferred Employees who participate in the
Seller component of the Seller Thrift Plan (the "Grandfathered Participants"),
Buyer shall cause the Grandfathered Participants to be eligible to participate
in the Buyer 401(k) Plan, effective as of the Closing Date. Each Grandfathered
Participant shall, as of the Closing Date, be treated as a terminated
participant under the Seller Thrift Plan. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date and in accordance with the terms of the Seller Thrift Plan, each
Grandfathered Participant shall be given the option to receive a distribution
of his or her account balance under the Seller Thrift Plan from such plan and,
in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the Buyer 401(k) Plan,
elect to roll over such amount including any notes corresponding to
outstanding loans into the Buyer 401(k) Plan to the extent permitted under
such Buyer 401(k) Plan.

(g) Deferred Compensation Plans.

(i) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall establish or designate
nonqualified deferred compensation plans (collectively, the "Buyer Deferred
Compensation Plans") for the benefit of (A) the Business Employees and (B)
Former Business Employees whose employment terminated from an Acquired Entity
on, or during the thirty-six (36)-month period preceding, the Closing Date
(collectively the "Business Employee DCP Participants"), in each case, who,
immediately prior to the Closing, were participants in one of the nonqualified
deferred compensation plans maintained by any Sellers and their Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries) that are listed in
Section 5.2(g)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Seller
Deferred Compensation Plans"). From and after the Closing, Buyer and the Buyer
Deferred Compensation Plans shall assume all Liabilities with respect to or
relating to Business Employee DCP Participants under the applicable Seller
Deferred Compensation Plan, and Sellers and their Affiliates and the Seller
Deferred Compensation Plans shall be relieved of all such Liabilities under
such Seller Deferred Compensation Plans with respect to the Business Employee
DCP Participants.

(ii) From and after the Closing, the Acquired Entities shall continue to
sponsor the nonqualified deferred compensation plans listed in Section
5.2(g)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Acquired Entity Deferred
Compensation Plans") and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Section 5.2(g)(ii), shall retain all Liabilities under the Acquired Entity
Deferred Compensation Plans. Sellers shall establish or designate 

nonqualified deferred compensation plans (collectively, the "New Seller
Deferred Compensation Plans") for the benefit of individuals who are employed
on the Signing Date by Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Entities and their Subsidiaries) (other than the individual identified on
Section 5.2(g)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule the Liability for whom
shall remain with the Acquired Entities) (collectively, the "Non-Business
Employee DCP Participants") who, immediately prior to the Closing, are
participants in one of the Acquired Entity Deferred Compensation Plans. From
and after the Closing, Sellers and the New Seller Deferred Compensation Plans
shall assume all Liabilities with respect to or relating to the Non-Business
Employee DCP Participants under the applicable Acquired Entity Deferred
Compensation Plan, and Acquired Entities and the Acquired Entity Deferred
Compensation Plans shall be relieved of all such Liabilities under such
Acquired Entity Deferred Compensation Plans with respect to the Non-Business
Employee DCP Participants.

(iii) From and after the Closing, Sellers shall retain, or shall cause an
Affiliate of Sellers (other than any Acquired Entity) to retain, the
nonqualified deferred compensation plans listed in Section 5.2(g)(iii) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Retained Deferred Compensation Plans") and
all Liabilities under such plans, including any such Liabilities in respect of
Business Employees or Former Business Employees. Subject to Sellers' provision
of a list setting forth the following, as of the Closing Date, for each
Transferred Employee who participates in each Retained Deferred Compensation
Plan: (i) the participant's name and (ii) any applicable distribution event,
Buyer shall (a) notify Sellers of the occurrence of the "separation from
service" of, or other distribution event under Section 409A of the Code and
used in the applicable Retained Deferred Compensation Plan that is applicable
to, any Transferred Employee who participates in a Retained Deferred
Compensation Plan, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days thereafter, and (b) if requested by Sellers, cooperate with
Sellers and their Affiliates to facilitate payment of amounts due to any
Transferred Employee under a Retained Deferred Compensation Plan, including,
if requested by Sellers no later than ten (10) Business Days following
notification to Sellers of the "separation from service" of, or other
distribution event under Section 409A of the Code and used in the applicable
Retained Deferred Compensation Plan that is applicable to, such Transferred
Employee, by paying such amounts subject to applicable Tax withholding and
remitting the Tax withholding and payroll Taxes to the appropriate Tax
authority, subject to reimbursement (including the employer's portion of any
payroll Taxes or other applicable Taxes) by Sellers within thirty (30) days
following the applicable payment date.

(h) Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time. Buyer shall recognize and
assume all Liabilities with respect to accrued but unused (as of the Closing
Date) vacation, sick leave and personal time for all Transferred Employees who
are not represented by a labor union or otherwise covered by the terms of a
CBA. Following the Closing Date and until the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall allow all Transferred Employees who are not represented by a
labor union or otherwise covered by the terms of a CBA to use the vacation, 

sick leave and personal time recognized or established in accordance with the
first sentence hereof in accordance with the terms of the Seller Plans in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, (i)
the covenants in this Section 5.2(h) shall govern the Transferred Employees'
post-Closing use of accrued but unused vacation, sick leave, and personal
time, but not the post-Closing accrual of vacation, sick leave, or personal
time (which shall be governed by the covenants in Section 5.2(c)(i)), and (ii)
the treatment of vacation, sick leave, and personal time off for all
Transferred Employees represented by a labor union or otherwise covered by the
terms of a CBA shall be governed by the terms of the applicable CBA, rather
than the terms of this Section 5.2(h).

(i) Workers' Compensation. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be responsible for all workers' compensation benefits payable
to or on behalf of the Business Employees or Former Business Employees,
whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing Date; provided, however,
that with respect to all workers' compensation benefits payable to or on
behalf of any Business Employee or Former Business Employee relating to
injuries or other events occurring during the period on or prior to the
Closing Date, Sellers shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against
all Liabilities arising from such injuries or events for which greater than
$250,000 remains to be paid on such individual claim following the Closing
Date.

(j) Certain Actions. Sellers shall take the actions set forth in Section
5.2(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

(k) Employee Communications. Prior to the Closing, any employee notices or
communication materials (including website postings) from Buyer or its
Affiliates or any Seller or its Affiliates to the Business Employees relating
to (i) the compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement, or
(ii) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or employment thereafter
shall be subject to the prior review, comment, and approval of the other
party, except as otherwise required by applicable Law, provided, however, that
the party whose consent is required shall confer in good faith with the other
party regarding approval of such communications.

(l) Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding and inure
solely to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall confer upon any employee, independent
contractor, any beneficiary or any other Person any rights or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Nothing contained
herein, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, policy or scheme;
(ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Acquired Entities, Buyer or any
of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement, arrangement, policy or scheme at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; or (iii) shall prevent
the Acquired Entities, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates from
terminating the employment of any employee or service of an independent
contractor after the Closing Date. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the terms set forth in this Agreement shall not create any right in any
employee or independent contractor or any other individual service provider to
any continued employment with the Acquired Entities, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever, or otherwise alter any existing or at- 

will employment relationship between any employee of the Acquired Entities,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates.

Section 5.3 Access to Information.

(a) Subject to Section 5.4, until the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of ARTICLE VII,
each of Seller Parent and each Seller shall cause its Representatives to
afford Representatives of Buyer reasonable access during normal business
hours, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and in accordance with the
reasonable procedures established by Seller Parent or such Seller, in
furtherance of the consummation of the Sale and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to the officers, directors, employees, MSOs,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Business and the Acquired
Assets (including all Business Real Property) and the books and records
relating thereto (in each case solely to the extent relating to the Business,
the Acquired Assets, Assumed Liabilities or Acquired Entities or in connection
with the Separation Activities); provided that such access shall only be upon
the reasonable advance request of Buyer and shall not unreasonably disrupt
personnel, operations and properties of the Business; provided, further, that
Seller Parent and each Seller shall make available, or cause its Subsidiaries
to make available, to the extent required or requested by Buyer, Business
Employee or Former Business Employee personnel files or other information
relating to the Business Employees and Former Business Employees that is
relevant to any Acquired Entity Plan (provided that, unless required by Buyer
to satisfy its obligations under Section 5.2, no Seller shall make, or cause
to be made, available medical records, workers' compensation records or the
results of any drug testing; and that Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
each Seller and its Affiliates (including the other Subsidiaries of such
Seller (other than Acquired Entities)) harmless from any Liabilities arising
out of or relating to Buyer's and its Affiliates' use of such personnel
files). In exercising its rights under this Section 5.3(a), Buyer shall
conduct itself so as not to unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the
Business prior to the Closing. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any contact
or communication by Buyer and its Representatives with officers, employees or
agents of the Business hereunder shall be arranged, and, if so determined in
Seller Parent's reasonable judgement, supervised (provided that Buyer shall
have the right to reasonably request that such contact or communication be
unsupervised and, upon such request, Seller Parent or such applicable Seller
shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent), by
Representatives of the applicable Seller or Seller Parent, unless such Seller
or Seller Parent otherwise expressly consents in writing with respect to any
specific contact. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement but subject to Sellers' obligations pursuant to Section 5.22, no
Seller nor any Affiliates of any Seller (including the Acquired Entities)
shall be required to disclose to Buyer or any of its Representatives any: (i)
information to the extent: (A) relating to any acquisition, sale or
divestiture process conducted by such Seller or its Affiliates for the
Business or such Seller's or its Affiliates' (or their Representatives')
evaluation of the Business in connection therewith, or any information
concerning the Sale Process, in each case, including projections, financial or
other information relating thereto; (B) doing so could reasonably be expected
to violate any Contract (provided that each Seller shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain consents or waivers from third parties under any such
Contract in order to disclose such information to Buyer (it being understood
that in no event shall any Seller or its Affiliates be obligated to pay any
consent fee or other consideration in connection with their 

efforts to obtain such consents or waivers)) or Law to which any Seller or any
of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) is a party or is subject
or which it believes in good faith would reasonably be expected to result in a
loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of attorney-client
privilege; or (C) if any Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation and such information is reasonably pertinent thereto; provided,
however, that in the event the restrictions of this clause (i) apply, such
Seller shall provide Buyer with a reasonable description of the information
not provided, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and such Seller shall
cooperate in good faith to design and implement alternative disclosure
arrangements to enable Buyer to evaluate any such information without
resulting in any such violation; or (ii) Tax Return or any other information
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns (other than information relating solely to
the Business and the Acquired Entities). Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Buyer shall not have the right to perform or conduct, or cause
to be performed or conducted, any environmental sampling or testing at, in, on
or underneath any Business Real Property prior to the Closing without the
prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, if such sampling or testing is reasonably
requested by an insurance underwriter in connection with the Environmental
Insurance Policy.

(b) Except as provided otherwise in Section 5.16, Buyer shall retain the
books, records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings,
evidence of title and other papers relating to the Business, the Acquired
Entities, the Assumed Liabilities and the Acquired Assets in its possession or
the possession of its Affiliates until seven (7) years following the Closing
Date or such longer period as may be required by Law or applicable court
order.

(c) After the Closing, upon reasonable advance written request, Buyer shall
furnish or cause to be furnished to Sellers and their respective
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to employees
of the Business (including to prepare and appear as witnesses) and such
information as existing on the Closing Date (including the right to make
copies), cooperation and assistance relating to the Business and the Acquired
Entities as is necessary for any reasonable business purpose, including
insurance matters, financial reporting and accounting matters, the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return, the defense of any Tax Proceeding, in connection
with any disclosure obligation or the defense of any Action (including any
Action that constitutes a Retained Liability, but excluding Actions between
any Buyer Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates shall be required to disclose to any Seller or any of its
Representatives any information to the extent: (A) doing so could violate any
Contract (provided that Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to obtain consents
or waivers from third parties under any such Contract in order to disclose
such information to any Seller (it being understood that in no event shall
Buyer or its Affiliates be obligated to pay any consent fee or other
consideration in connection with their efforts to obtain such consents or
waivers)) or Law to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party or is
subject or which it believes in good faith would reasonably be expected to
result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of attorney-
client privilege or (B) if Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller, on the other hand, are adverse
parties in a litigation and such information is reasonably pertinent thereto.
In exercising its rights under this Section 5.3(c), each Seller shall conduct
itself so as not to unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the Business. 

Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in assisting any Seller pursuant to this Section 5.3(c).

(d) During the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller
Parent and Sellers and their respective Representatives shall cooperate with
Buyer and its Representatives with respect to providing information and making
determinations with respect to the identification of, and the potential impact
and liabilities under Section 280G of the Code associated with, Business
Employees and Former Business Employees who are or may be determined to be
"disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) as
a result of, or due to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.4 Confidentiality.

(a) Buyer and its Representatives shall treat all nonpublic information
obtained in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated
by reference and shall continue in full force and effect following the
Closing, except that Buyer's confidentiality obligations in the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to information to the extent relating
to the Business, the Acquired Entities, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities will terminate effective upon, and only upon, the Closing;
provided, however, that Buyer acknowledges that its obligations of
confidentiality and non-disclosure with respect to any and all other
information provided to it by or on behalf of Sellers, their Subsidiaries, the
Acquired Entities or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives,
concerning the Excluded Businesses, Sellers, Sellers' Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates (other than to the extent related to the Business,
the Acquired Entities (and Subsidiaries thereof), the Acquired Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities) shall continue to remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. The parties expressly agree that,
notwithstanding any provision of the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, including with respect to termination thereof, if, for any reason,
the Closing does not occur and this Agreement is terminated, and the remaining
term of the Confidentiality Agreement is less than twelve (12) months, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as provided
in Section 7.2 for a period of twelve (12) months following termination of
this Agreement and otherwise in accordance with its terms, and this Agreement
shall constitute the requisite consent of the parties to amend the
Confidentiality Agreement accordingly.

(b) From and after the Closing, each of Seller Parent and Sellers shall, and
shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, keep confidential and not use for any purpose or disclose
to any third party all confidential and proprietary or nonpublic information
to the extent relating to Buyer, the Acquired Entities, the Acquired Assets,
the Business and the Assumed Liabilities of which such Person may be aware
("Confidential Business Information"); provided that the term "Confidential
Business Information" will not include any information (i) that becomes
available to Sellers or their Affiliates or their respective Representatives
from and after the Closing, from a third party source that is not known by any
Seller, after reasonable inquiry, to be under any obligations of
confidentiality in respect of such information, (ii) that is or becomes
generally available to, or known by, the public (other than as 

a result of disclosure in violation hereof or in violation of any other
obligation of confidentiality) or (iii) that is or was derived independently
by any Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives without use of or reference to Confidential Business
Information; provided, further, that the applicable Seller and its
Representatives may disclose Confidential Business Information if required by
judicial or administrative process or by any other requirements of applicable
Law, regulation or legal or regulatory process. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict any
use or disclosure by any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives of any Confidential Business Information or protected
information under the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent such use or
disclosure is necessary for such party and such Representatives to handle
post-Closing matters as expressly required or permitted by this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, including in connection with any adjustment to the
Initial Purchase Price, the provision of services and the performance of other
obligations pursuant to any of the Ancillary Agreements, for the purpose of
complying with the terms of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements
or any Contract that has not been assigned or transferred pursuant to Section
5.7, any indemnification claim made by any Buyer Indemnified Party, any post-
Closing Tax filings, any filings with or audit by any Governmental Entity, the
preparation of financial statements or Tax Returns or in furtherance of any
other reasonable business purposes.

(c) If any party is required by Law, regulation, stock exchange rule or legal
or regulatory process to disclose any nonpublic information contemplated by
Section 5.4(b), such party being required to make such disclosure (the
"Disclosing Party") shall (i) if and as may be requested by the other party
and at such other party's sole cost and expense, take reasonable steps to
preserve the confidentiality of such information, including requesting that
such information not be disclosed to non-parties or the public; (ii) disclose
only that portion of the information that such party is advised by counsel is
required to be disclosed; (iii) to the extent permissible under applicable
Law, give the other party prompt prior written notice of such request or
requirement so that such other party may seek, at its sole cost and expense,
an appropriate protective order or other remedy; and (iv) cooperate with the
other party, at such other party's sole cost and expense, to obtain such
protective order. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained, such Disclosing Party will furnish only that portion of such
information which, on the advice of such Disclosing Party's counsel, is
legally required to be disclosed and, upon the other party's request and at
the other party's sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts
to seek confidential treatment (to the extent available) of such information.

Section 5.5 Efforts.

(a) Each of Buyer and each Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to promptly do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other in doing, all things
reasonably necessary and proper under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Sale and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable and in any event prior to the Outside Date,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings in connection therewith and 

(ii) subject to Section 5.5(c), the defending of any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Sale.

(b) Buyer and Sellers shall promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Signing Date, file (or cause to be filed) any and all
required pre-merger notification and report forms under the HSR Act with
respect to the Sale. Buyer and Sellers shall request early termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws and shall respectively use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of such
waiting periods, and shall supply to the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice ("Antitrust Division") or the United States
Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information or documents that may be requested pursuant to any Law.
Any filing fees payable to Governmental Entities in connection with filings
pursuant to the HSR Act shall be borne by Sellers.

(c) In furtherance of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section
5.5, (i) if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any
proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the Sale as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the parties
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction, or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that results from such action or proceeding and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Sale on or before the Outside Date
and (ii) Buyer and Sellers shall each take all such further action as may be
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust
Law so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in
any event no later than the Outside Date), and including proposing,
negotiating, committing and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order,
or otherwise, to (x) sell, divest, dispose of or otherwise hold separate
(including by establishing a trust or otherwise), any of the businesses,
assets or properties of Buyer, the Acquired Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates, including the Business and the Acquired Assets and (y)
otherwise take or commit to take actions that after the Closing would limit
Buyer's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to operate and/or
retain any of the businesses, assets or properties of Buyer, the Acquired
Entities or any of their respective Affiliates (other than any Seller or any
Affiliate of any Seller following the Closing), including the Business and the
Acquired Assets (the actions described in the foregoing clauses (x) and (y)
being "Divestiture Actions"); provided, however, notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required to propose, negotiate, commit
to, effect or agree to Divestiture Actions relating to the businesses, assets
or properties of Buyer, the Acquired Entities or any of their respective
Affiliates that, directly or indirectly, generated in the aggregate EBITDA in
excess of four-hundred million dollars ($400,000,000) during the twelve (12)
calendar months ended December 31, 2019. The parties hereto agree that solely
for the purposes of this Section 5.5(c), (1) "EBITDA" means store-level EBITDA
calculated in a manner consistent with the methodology set forth in Section
5.5(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and (2) the calculation of store-
level EBITDA shall be measured by reference to the store-level EBITDA of the
Acquired Entities for each such overlapping business, asset or property
required to be divested to satisfy the conditions to Closing, regardless of
which business, asset or property Buyer actually divests or agrees to divest.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Seller nor any
Affiliate 

of any Seller shall be obligated to take or agree or commit to take any action
(i) that is not conditioned on the Closing or (ii) that relates to any
Excluded Assets or Excluded Businesses; and in no event shall any Seller or
any of its Affiliates be required to be the licensing, selling, divesting,
leasing, transferring, disposing or encumbering party under any such
agreements unless required by the relevant Governmental Entity or applicable
Law, and, in any case, no Seller nor any Affiliate of any Seller shall have
any direct or indirect obligation or Liability in respect of any such
agreements, transactions or relationships, including any indemnification
obligations, for which such Seller and its Affiliates are not fully
indemnified by Buyer.

(d) Buyer shall have the right (subject to compliance with Section 5.5(e) and
its other obligations under this Section 5.5) to determine, direct and have
control over the strategy and process by which the parties will seek required
approvals under the Antitrust Laws and to control the defense or prosecution
of any claims, actions or proceedings relating thereto, including all matters
relating to any Divestiture Actions.

(e) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all filings, notifications, communications,
submissions, and any other actions pursuant to this Section 5.5, and, subject
to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, Buyer and Sellers shall keep each other apprised on a current basis of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by Buyer and Sellers, as the case may
be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, from any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions.
Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Buyer and
Sellers shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed notifications or filings and any substantive
written communications or submissions to any Governmental Entity; provided,
however, that materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Business and the Acquired Assets or information
concerning the Sale Process, or proposals from third parties with respect
thereto, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual agreements, and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Buyer
and Sellers agree not to participate in any meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate.

Section 5.6 Consents. Each Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to promptly do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with Buyer to obtain all consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.7 Separation Activities.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, subject to Section 5.7(b), Section 5.7(c), and

Acquired Companies, and the Acquired Companies shall accept the assignment,
transfer, conveyance and delivery of, all Equity Interests in the Acquired
Entities (other than the Acquired Companies) free and clear of all
Encumbrances at Closing (other than transfer restrictions under securities
Laws and any encumbrances granted to any lender at the Closing in connection
with any financing by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby), (D)
Seller Parent and each of its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Entities)
shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver to an Acquired Entity, or cause to
be assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered to an Acquired Entity (other

Entity) shall accept the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of, and
(as applicable) assume, all of the Acquired Assets free and clear of all
Encumbrances at Closing (other than Permitted Encumbrances) and only those
Liabilities set forth on Section 1.1(AL) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, in
each case to the extent that any such Equity Interest, Acquired Asset or
Assumed Liability is not already owned and held directly or indirectly by the
Acquired Companies or another Acquired Entity, as applicable, (E) Tesoro
Refining and Marketing Company LLC and Treasure Franchise Co. LLC shall assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to the Newco Entity or cause to be assigned,
transferred, conveyed and delivered to the Newco Entity, and the Newco Entity
shall accept the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of, and (as
applicable) assume, all of the Acquired Assets free and clear of all
Encumbrances at Closing (other than Permitted Encumbrances) and the Retail
Business Liabilities, and (F) none of Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to an Acquired Entity, or cause to be
assigned, transferred, conveyed and delivered to an Acquired Entity, and none
of the Acquired Entities shall accept the assignment, transfer, conveyance and
delivery of, or assume, any Liability other than those Liabilities set forth
on Section 1.1(AL) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and, solely with respect
to Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company LLC and Treasure Franchise Co. LLC to
the Newco Entity, the Retail Business Liabilities; (i) the Acquired Entities
shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Sellers or the Retained
Subsidiaries, and Sellers and the Retained Subsidiaries shall accept the
assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery of, all of the Excluded Assets
and the Retained Liabilities, in each case to the extent that any such
Excluded Asset or Retained Liability is owned or held directly or indirectly
by any Acquired Entity, as applicable ((i) and (ii) collectively, the
"Separation Activities"); and (i) as contemplated by Section 5.7(c) and
Section 5.7(d), each Seller shall otherwise provide the Acquired Entities the
right to use or the economic benefits of any Acquired Assets, and the Acquired
Entities shall pay, perform or discharge any liabilities or obligations under
any Assumed Liabilities, in each case, that are not transferred to an Acquired
Entity at or prior to the Closing pursuant to the Separation Activities. This
Section 5.7(a) shall not be deemed to apply to any Business Permits, and
Sellers' obligations with respect to Business Permits shall be governed by
Section 5.7(b). Sellers shall be entitled to, and Buyer may reasonably request
Sellers to, modify or amend the Separation Plan from time to time, provided
that (x) in the case that Sellers determine to make any modification or
amendment to the Separation Plan, (1) Sellers shall deliver a statement
setting forth such modified or amended 

Separation Plan to Buyer as promptly as practicable following any such
decision to modify or amend, and (2) Sellers shall not modify or amend the
Separation Plan without Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (y) in the case that
Buyer requests Sellers to make any modification or amendment to the Separation
Plan, (1) Buyer shall deliver a statement setting forth such proposed modified
or amended Separation Plan to Sellers, (2) Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer
using reasonable best efforts to consider and agree to such modification and
amendment so long as such modification would not reasonably be expected to
adversely affect Sellers, other than in any de minimis respect and (3) Sellers
and Buyer agree that any incremental Transfer Taxes imposed solely on any such
modification or amendment to the Separation Plan requested by Buyer and agreed
to by Sellers pursuant to this Section 5.7(a)(y) shall be borne solely by
Buyer (determined on a "with and without" basis). If the Separation Plan is so
modified, Section 3.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and the definition
of "Sellers" shall be deemed to be automatically amended to reflect such
modifications to the extent applicable.

(b) Prior to the Closing, (x) each Seller shall transfer (or cause to be
transferred) the Seller Business Permits to one or more Acquired Entities, (or
if not permitted by applicable Law or the terms of such Seller Business
Permit, shall obtain a replacement for such Seller Business Permit), in each
case, at such Seller's sole cost and expense, and (y) shall cause the Acquired
Entities to maintain all Business Permits. To the extent any Business Permits
are not held by the Acquired Entities as of the Closing, (i) each Seller shall
transfer (or cause to be transferred) any Seller Business Permit not held by
the Acquired Entities as of the Closing, (or if not permitted by applicable
Law or the terms of such Seller Business Permit, shall obtain a replacement
for such Business Permit), as soon as practicable after the Closing at such
Seller's sole cost and expense, (ii) Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other in good faith and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
implement appropriate arrangements (to the extent permitted under applicable
Law and applicable Business Permits) so as to allow the continued operation of
the Business by the Acquired Entities notwithstanding the absence of such
Business Permits; provided that Sellers shall have no further obligation
hereunder with respect to any Seller Business Permit if Buyer's failure to
perform any covenant or obligation under this Section 5.7 has been a principal
cause of the failure to transfer or obtain a replacement for such Seller
Business Permit prior to the Closing). For the avoidance of doubt, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, from and after the Closing, the cost of
maintaining any Permit necessary or appropriate to operate the Business shall
be Buyer's responsibility at its sole cost and expense. Each Seller and its
Affiliates shall be obligated, at such Seller's or Affiliate's sole cost and
expense, to provide any guarantees, letters of credit, surety bonds, similar
credit assurances or replacements or substitutions thereof that may be
required in connection with the foregoing until Closing, and such instruments
shall be deemed Seller Guaranties and subject to the terms and conditions of
Section 5.20 after the Closing. The foregoing obligations are in addition to
the Governmental Filings contemplated by Section 5.5 and shall in no way limit
or affect the respective obligations of the parties under Section 5.5.

(c) To the extent that the sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery
to, or the assumption by, any Acquired Entity of any Acquired Asset (including
any Assigned Contract) or Assumed Liability is prohibited by any applicable
Law or would require any consent, permit, authorization, clearance, waiver or
approval (each, an "Approval") and such Approval shall not have been obtained
on or prior to 

the Closing Date, then, unless the parties hereto shall otherwise agree, the
transfer or assignment of such Acquired Asset or the assumption of such
Assumed Liability, as the case may be, shall be automatically deemed deferred
and any such purported transfer, assignment or assumption shall be null and
void until such time as all legal or Contract impediments are removed or such
Approval has been obtained or made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
Asset or Liability shall continue to constitute an Acquired Asset or Assumed
Liability, as applicable, for all other purposes of this Agreement.

(d) If after the Closing Date any Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability is owned
or held by Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired
Entities), then, insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by
Law and any applicable Contract: (i) Seller Parent or such Subsidiary owning
or holding such Asset shall thereafter hold such Asset for the use and benefit
of Buyer (at the expense of Buyer); (ii) Buyer shall, or shall cause one of
its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Entities) to, pay, perform and
discharge such Liability, on a timely basis and in accordance with the terms
thereof, on behalf of Seller Parent or such Subsidiary holding such liability;
and (iii) Seller Parent or such Subsidiary owning or holding such Asset or
Liability shall treat such Asset or Liability in the Ordinary Course of
Business and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by Buyer
(at such Sellers' sole expense) in order to place Buyer in a substantially
similar position as if such Asset or Liability had been transferred, assigned,
assumed or retained in connection with the Closing to or by the party entitled
thereto and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Asset or
Liability, including use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion,
control and command over such Asset or Liability, and all costs and expenses
related thereto, shall inure from and after the Closing Date to Buyer.

(e) To the extent that the sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery
to, or the assumption by, any Seller or any Retained Subsidiary of any
Excluded Asset or Retained Liability is prohibited by any applicable Law or
would require any Approval and such Approval shall not have been obtained on
or prior to the Closing Date, then, unless the parties hereto shall otherwise
agree, the transfer or assignment of such Excluded Asset or the assumption of
such Retained Liability, as the case may be, shall be automatically deemed
deferred and any such purported transfer, assignment or assumption shall be
null and void until such time as all legal or Contract impediments are removed
or such Approval has been obtained or made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such Asset or Liability shall continue to constitute an Excluded Asset or
Retained Liability, as applicable, for all other purposes of this Agreement.

(f) If after the Closing Date any Excluded Asset or Retained Liability is
owned or held by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Entities),
then, insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by Law and
any applicable Contract: (i) Buyer or its Subsidiary owning or holding such
Asset shall thereafter hold such Asset for the use and benefit of Sellers (at
the expense of Sellers); (ii) the applicable Seller shall, or shall cause one
of its Retained Subsidiaries to, pay, perform and discharge such Liability, on
a timely basis and in accordance with the terms thereof, on behalf of Buyer or
its Subsidiary holding such liability; and (iii) Buyer or its applicable
Subsidiary owning or holding such Asset or Liability shall treat such Asset or
Liability in the Ordinary Course of Business in accordance with past practice
and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by such Seller (at
such Seller's sole expense) in order to place such Seller in a substantially
similar position as if such Asset or 

Liability had been transferred, assigned, assumed or retained in connection
with the Closing to or by the party entitled thereto and so that all the
benefits and burdens relating to such Asset or Liability, including use, risk
of loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such Asset
or Liability, and all costs and expenses related thereto, shall inure from and
after the Closing Date to such Seller.

(g) Following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate using their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly any consents, permits,
authorizations, clearances, waivers or approvals required for the assignment
and transfer of any Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities to an Acquired
Entity or transfer any Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities to a Seller or
Retained Subsidiary that were not transferred prior to Closing. If and when
any such Approval for the assignment and transfer of any such Acquired Assets
or Assumed Liabilities is obtained or Buyer notifies Sellers that Buyer has
determined that such Approval is no longer necessary, Sellers shall promptly
convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be conveyed, transferred,
assigned and delivered, such Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities to Buyer
or an Acquired Entity for no further consideration. If and when any such
Approval for the assignment and transfer of any such Excluded Assets or
Retained Liabilities is obtained or any Seller notifies Buyer that such Seller
has determined that such Approval is no longer necessary, Buyer shall promptly
convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be conveyed, transferred,
assigned and delivered, such Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities to such
Seller or Retained Subsidiary for no further consideration.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except as
provided in Section 5.7(a)(y)(3), (i) all Taxes imposed on the Separation
Activities and (ii) any Transfer Taxes reasonably expected to be imposed on or
payable in connection with the Sale as a result of the Separation Activities,
shall be the sole responsibility of Sellers. Except as provided in Section
5.7(a)(y)(3), Sellers agree that Buyer shall not have any Liability or
responsibility whatsoever to Sellers for any Taxes imposed on the Separation
Activities.

Section 5.8 Publicity. Sellers, Seller Parent and Buyer agree to communicate
with each other and cooperate with each other prior to any public disclosure
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall coordinate the
timing of any public disclosure. Sellers, Seller Parent and Buyer agree that
no public release, filings, notifications, announcement or other
communications (including any proxy statement or other communication with
shareholders and Governmental Filings) concerning the terms, conditions or
substance of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
issued, released, filed, disseminated or published by any party or its
Affiliates without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that each of
Sellers and Buyer may issue (a) an initial joint press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement that has been agreed upon by Sellers, Seller
Parent and Buyer, (b) any press release or public announcement so long as any
statements contained therein concerning the Sale or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consistent with previous releases or
announcements made by the applicable party with respect to which such party
has complied with the provisions of this Section 5.8 and (c) such other
release or announcement that, upon the advice of outside counsel, is likely
required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which
the securities of any Seller, Seller Parent or Buyer, as applicable, or any of
their respective Affiliates, are listed. Each party shall, to the extent
practicable, allow the other 

party reasonable time to review and comment on all public releases, filings,
notifications, announcement or other communications (including proxy statement
and other communications with shareholders and Governmental Filings)
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby in advance of their issuance,
release, filing, dissemination or publication. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Section 5.8 shall preclude any party from disclosing this
Agreement or the substance or any relevant details of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on a confidential basis to any of its
Representatives, provided that such Representatives have been informed of such
party's confidentiality obligations hereunder and under the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Section 5.9 Further Assurances.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, and without limiting or expanding the
obligations of the parties under any other provision of this Agreement,
including those set forth in Section 5.5, each of the parties hereto agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all action, to do
or cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other party hereto in
doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including: (i) the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the
parties hereto including preparing for the provision of and receipt of the
transition services contemplated under the Transition Services Agreement; (ii)
the obtaining of all applicable Permits, authorizations, approvals, consents
and waivers of any Governmental Entity or third party, including any Approval
necessary to sell, assign, transfer and convey (or cause to be sold, assigned,
transferred and conveyed, as applicable) any Assigned Contract to the Acquired
Entities and for the Sale; (iii) the defending of any Actions, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the performance of
the obligations hereunder; (iv) the good faith negotiation of the final forms
of the Ancillary Agreements (consistent with the applicable Exhibits hereto
and with such changes as Sellers and Buyer may otherwise agree in good faith);
and (v) the execution and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such
other actions as the other party hereto may reasonably require in order to
carry out the intent of this Agreement. Sellers and Sellers' Affiliates (other
than the Acquired Entities) shall be obligated to, or, prior to Closing,
Sellers shall cause the Acquired Entities to, make any payments (including to
the extent required in connection with the transfer of Permits contemplated by
Section 5.7(b)) or pay consideration to any third party to obtain any
applicable consent, waiver or approval.

(b) Each of Sellers, Seller Parent and Buyer shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, take all actions reasonably necessary so as to allow
Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, to be ready and able to provide the goods and
services contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements at the Closing.

(c) Subject to Section 5.7, within five (5) years after the Closing Date, if
any party discovers that any Acquired Assets were not transferred to the
Acquired Entities or Buyer as part of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then any such Assets shall be deemed to have
been held in trust by Sellers and the Retained Subsidiaries, and Seller Parent
shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (if applicable) to
promptly 

transfer, assign and convey such assets to an Acquired Entity or Buyer as
directed by Buyer without any additional consideration therefor.

(d) Subject to Section 5.7, within five (5) years after the Closing Date, if
any party discovers that any of the Acquired Entities owns any Assets that
constituted or should have constituted Excluded Assets as of the Closing Date,
or that any Assets that have otherwise been transferred by any Seller or any
of its Affiliates to Buyer or any of its Affiliates were or should have
constituted Excluded Assets as of the Closing Date, then any such Assets shall
be deemed to have been held in trust by the Acquired Entities, Buyer or their
Affiliates for Sellers and the Retained Subsidiaries, and Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Acquired Entities and its other Affiliates to, promptly
transfer, assign and convey such assets to Sellers (or any of their Affiliates
as designated by Sellers) without any consideration therefor. With respect to
each Retail Site, on or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall use
reasonable best efforts to remove all Excluded Assets (other than those
Excluded Assets owned by third Persons) from the Business Real Property, as
well as signs, signage or advertising bearing or displaying Excluded Assets or
any Excluded Marks except, in each case, to the extent required to continue
ongoing operations of such Business Real Property in the Ordinary Course of
Business (such as branded fuel signage for a brand that will continue to be
utilized past the Closing Date). Unless otherwise agreed between Seller Parent
and Buyer, any such Excluded Assets not removed from the applicable Retail
Site within three (3) months after the Closing shall be deemed abandoned by
Sellers, and Buyer may dispose of such Excluded Assets in whatever manner
Buyer may elect.

Section 5.10 Contacts. During the period commencing on the date hereof and
ending on the Closing Date and without limiting the rights or obligations of
the parties contained in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the provisions of Section 5.3(a)), without the prior written consent of
the applicable Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall not, and shall cause its officers,
directors, employees and other Representatives not to, contact any material
suppliers, vendors or dealers to, franchisees of, or others having material
business relationships with, the Business in connection with or pertaining to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.
In the event such Sellers provides such consent, such Seller shall have the
option to require that a management employee or other Representative of such
Seller accompany Buyer's Representative(s) to any meeting with such suppliers
or customers and participate with Buyer's Representative in any such
discussions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.10 shall not limit
or otherwise restrict Buyer or its Affiliates from contacting or having
business dealings with any such Person with whom Buyer or such Affiliate has
or may have business dealings, so long as such contact or business dealings
relate to Buyer's or its Affiliates' operation of their business and not to
such Seller's or its Affiliates' business dealing with such Person with
respect to the Business or the Acquired Assets or with respect to any aspect
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

Section 5.11 Termination of Inter-Company Agreements and Balances.

(a) Except for (i) this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) those
Contracts, if any, set forth on Section 5.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, Sellers shall terminate, on or prior to the Closing, all Contracts,
written or oral, between any Seller (solely with respect to the Business), any
Retained Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates 

(other than the Acquired Entities), on the one hand, and any Acquired Entity,
on the other hand (the "Terminating Contracts").

(b) Except as set forth on Section 5.11(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
and other than any payables, receivables or other inter-company accounts under
any Ancillary Agreement, Sellers shall, as of the Closing, eliminate (by way
of capital contribution, cash settlement or as otherwise determined by Sellers
in their sole discretion) all inter-company accounts existing prior to the
Closing, whether payables or receivables, between any Seller, any Retained
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Entities), on the one hand, and the Acquired Entities, on the other hand. Any
such inter-company accounts that are settled after the Effective Time but in
connection with and contemporaneously with the Closing shall be deemed for
purposes of this Section 5.11 to have been settled as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Intercompany balances and accounts solely among any of the
Acquired Entities (or Subsidiaries thereof) shall not be affected by the above
provisions of this Section 5.11(b).

Section 5.12 Termination of Certain Support Services. Buyer acknowledges that
the Business currently receives from Sellers and their Affiliates certain
administrative and corporate services and benefits of a type generally
provided to other businesses and Subsidiaries of Sellers (the "Support
Services"). Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that all Support Services shall
cease at Closing, and all agreements and arrangements (whether or not in
writing) in respect thereof shall terminate as of the Closing Date, with no
further obligation of any party thereto, except to the extent set forth and in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Transition Services Agreement,
Transportation Services Agreement or as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 5.13 Insurance Matters. Buyer acknowledges that the policies and
insurance coverage maintained in favor of the Business, the Acquired Entities
and the Acquired Assets are part of the corporate insurance program maintained
by Sellers and their Affiliates (such policies, the "Corporate Policies"), and
such coverage will not be available or transferred to Buyer or any Acquired
Entity. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Buyer agrees
not to and, from and after the Closing, agrees to cause the Acquired Entities
not to bring any claim for recovery under any of the Corporate Policies,
whether or not such Person may be so entitled in accordance with the terms of
such Corporate Policies. It is understood that Sellers shall be free at their
discretion at any time from and after the Closing to cancel or not renew any
of the Corporate Policies.

Section 5.14 Certain Intellectual Property Matters.

(a) Following the Closing and except to the extent permitted under any
Ancillary Agreement or other document or instrument delivered under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Entities and each of Buyer's other Affiliates to: (i) cease to make
any use (in any form or manner) of (Y) any names or Trademarks that include
the terms "Marathon" or "Marathon Corporation," or any other Trademark owned
by any Seller or any of its Affiliates other than as set forth on Section
5.14(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and/or (Z) any name or Trademark
that is derived from, a variant of or otherwise related to, or that contains
or comprises any the foregoing names or 

Trademarks (in part or whole, including any formatives thereof), and including
any contractions, combinations, abbreviations, derivations, translations or
transliterations of any such names and/or Trademarks, and any names or
Trademarks confusingly similar to, or likely to be confusingly similar to, or
dilutive of, any of the foregoing, in any jurisdiction in the world (and
regardless of whether alone or in combination with any other words, phrases or
designs) (collectively, all such names and Trademarks, the "Excluded Marks"),
including as part of any company name or Internet domain name; and (i) cease
to, and not at any time thereafter, hold itself or themselves out as having
any affiliation or association with any Seller or any of its Affiliates. For
the avoidance of doubt, "Excluded Marks" shall not include any Business
Intellectual Property. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
within ninety (90) days following the Closing, Buyer shall cause each of the
Acquired Entities having a name, Trademark or logo that includes the Excluded
Marks to change its name to a name that does not include the Excluded Marks,
including making any Governmental Filings necessary to effect such change,
and, within ninety (90) days following the Closing, Buyer shall complete the
removal of the Excluded Marks from all products, signage, vehicles,
properties, technical information, stationery and promotional or other
marketing materials and other assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Acquired Entities) shall be deemed to have violated this
Section 5.14, even after the periods provided above, by reason of: (i) their
use of equipment and other similar articles used in the Business as of the
Closing, notwithstanding that they may bear one or more of the Excluded Marks
(provided that it is not reasonably practicable to remove or cover such
Excluded Mark); (ii) the appearance of the Excluded Marks on any manuals, work
sheets, operating procedures, other written or electronic data, materials or
assets (including computer source code) that are used for internal purposes
only in connection with the Business; (iii) the appearance of the Excluded
Marks in or on any third party's publications, marketing materials, brochures
or instruction sheets that were distributed prior to the Closing and that are
not used by Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Acquired Entities) after such ninety (90) day period; or (iv) the use by Buyer
and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Entities) of
any Excluded Marks in a non-disparaging and non-trademark manner in textual
sentences that is factually accurate and non-prominent for purposes of
conveying to customers or the general public that the Business is no longer
affiliated with Sellers or to reference historical details concerning or make
historical reference to the Business. Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with
Buyer for the period from the Signing Date until the Closing to prepare the
Business and the Acquired Entities for the transition process described in
this Section 5.14.

(b) Sellers shall be responsible for any and all costs and expenses incurred
in assigning, transferring and recording any and all right, title and interest
of Sellers in the Business Intellectual Property and Business IT Assets to the
Acquired Entities, including the filing and recordation of assignment and
other instruments in order to evidence the transfer of any Business
Intellectual Property or Business IT Assets.

Section 5.15 Mail and Other Communications; Payments.

(a) After the Closing Date, each of Sellers, Buyer and their respective
Subsidiaries may receive mail, packages, facsimiles, email and other
communications properly belonging to the other (or the other's Subsidiaries).
Accordingly, at all times after the Closing 

Date, each of Sellers and Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries authorizes
Sellers and their Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, as the case may be, to receive and open
(acting solely as agent for the other party) all mail, packages, facsimiles,
email and other communications received by it and not unambiguously intended
for such other party (or its Subsidiaries) or any of such other party's (or
its Subsidiaries') officers or directors, and to retain the same to the extent
that they relate to the business of the receiving party or, to the extent that
they do not relate to the business of the receiving party, the receiving party
shall promptly deliver such mail, packages, facsimiles, email or other
communications (or, in case the same relate to both businesses, copies
thereof) to the other party. The provisions of this Section 5.15 are not
intended to, and shall not be deemed to, constitute an authorization by any of
Sellers, Buyer or their respective Subsidiaries to (i) permit the other to
accept service of process on its behalf and neither party is or shall be
deemed to be the agent of the other for service of process purposes or (ii)
waive any rights or privileges in respect of any such mail, package,
facsimile, email or other communication or the information contained therein.

(b) Sellers shall, or shall cause their applicable Affiliate to, promptly, but
in any case no later than ninety (90) days after receipt thereof, pay or
deliver to Buyer (or its designated Affiliates) any monies or checks that have
been sent to any Seller, any Retained Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Closing Date by customers, suppliers or other contracting
parties of the Business or the Acquired Entities or their Subsidiaries to the
extent that they constitute an Acquired Asset and are the property of Buyer or
the Acquired Entities hereunder.

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, promptly, but in
any case no later than ninety (90) days after receipt thereof, pay or deliver
to Sellers (or their respective designated Affiliates) any monies or checks
that have been sent to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Business
and the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries) after the Closing Date to
the extent that they constitute an Excluded Asset and are the property of any
Seller or its Affiliates hereunder.

Section 5.16 Tax Matters.

(a) Purchase Price Allocation.

(i) For all U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) Tax purposes,
Sellers and Buyer shall and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
allocate the Final Purchase Price and any other amounts treated as
consideration for such Tax purposes among the assets of the Acquired Companies
deemed sold for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes. No later than one-hundred
twenty (120) days after the date on which the Final Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.4, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers a proposed
allocation of the Final Purchase Price and any other items that are treated as
additional consideration for Tax purposes among the assets of the Acquired
Companies deemed sold for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes, which allocation
shall be determined in a manner consistent with Sections 338 (if applicable)
and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
("Buyer's Allocation"). Sellers may provide any comments on Buyer's Allocation
to Buyer within thirty (30) days after delivery of Buyer's Allocation, 

and Buyer shall consider in good faith and incorporate any reasonable comments
timely received from Sellers in accordance with this Section 5.16(a)(i).
Buyer's Allocation, as revised (the "Final Allocation"), shall be conclusive
and binding on Buyer and Sellers. The Final Allocation shall be adjusted, as
necessary, to reflect any subsequent payments treated as adjustments to the
purchase price pursuant to Section 5.16(f). Any such adjustment shall be
allocated, consistent with this Section 5.16(a)(i), to the asset or assets of
the Acquired Entity or Acquired Entities to which such adjustment is
attributable.

(ii) Sellers and Buyer shall not and shall cause their respective Affiliates
not to take any position inconsistent with the Final Allocation on any Tax
Return (including any of the Section 338(h)(10) Forms, if applicable), in
connection with any Tax Proceeding or otherwise, in each case, except to the
extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign Law). In the event that the Final Allocation is disputed by any Taxing
Authority, the party to this Agreement receiving notice of such dispute shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of such notice and resolution of
the dispute.

(b) Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, except for and without duplication of any reimbursement from Buyer
to Seller attributable to Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 9.4(b), Sellers
shall be liable for and shall pay (or cause to be paid) when due and shall
indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against all Transfer Taxes imposed
on the Sale. The party responsible under applicable Law for filing the Tax
Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file such
Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other party
for such party's review and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date therefor. Any comments on such Tax Return shall be provided to the party
responsible under applicable Law for filing such Tax Returns within ten (10)
days of receipt of any such Tax Return, and such party shall consider in good
faith any reasonable comments timely received in accordance with this Section
5.16(b). Sellers and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other filings
relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or
exclusion from the application or imposition of any such Transfer Taxes.

(c) Tax Sharing Agreements. To the extent relating to the Acquired Entities,
Sellers shall terminate or cause to be terminated, on or before the Closing
Date, the rights and obligations of the Acquired Entities pursuant to all Tax
sharing agreements or similar agreements (other than this Agreement), if any,
to which any of the Acquired Entities, on the one hand, and Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities), on the other
hand, are parties, and no Seller nor any of its Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Entities), on the one hand, nor any of the Acquired Entities, on the
other hand, shall have any rights or obligations to each other after the
Closing in respect of such agreements or arrangements.

(d) Tax Matters Cooperation. Each of Buyer and Sellers shall and shall cause
its respective Affiliates to cooperate fully, and as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns of the Acquired Entities and in respect of the Business or the
Acquired Assets, in connection with any Tax Proceeding or in connection 

with determining a liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request)
the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Sellers and Buyer shall retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to each of the Acquired Entities or the Acquired
Assets relating to any taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Buyer or Sellers, any extensions thereof), and shall abide
by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority.

(e) Treatment for United States Income Tax Purposes. For United States federal
Income Tax purposes and, to the greatest extent permitted by Law, for state
and local Income Tax purposes, each of Buyer and Sellers shall treat the
purchase and sale of the Acquired Company Interests, other than the purchase
and sale of the Section 338(h)(10) Eligible Subsidiaries, as a purchase and
sale of the Acquired Assets and shall treat the purchase and sale of each of
the Section 338(h)(10) Eligible Subsidiaries as a purchase and sale of the
Equity Interests in such subsidiaries; provided, however, that each of Buyer
and Sellers shall treat the purchase and sale of the Section 338(h)(10)
Subsidiaries, if any, as (i) a deemed transfer of all of the assets of such
Section 338(h)(10) Subsidiary to an unrelated person in exchange for
consideration that includes the discharge of liabilities in a single
transaction at the close of the Closing Date and, after such deemed asset sale
and while such Section 338(h)(10) Subsidiary is a member of the consolidated
group of which Seller Parent is the common parent, such Section 338(h)(10)
Subsidiary transferred all of its assets to members of such consolidated group
and ceased to exist and (ii) an acquisition by Buyer of the stock of such
unrelated person following the transactions deemed to have occurred in clause
(i) (the deemed transactions described in clauses (i) and (ii), the "Deemed
Section 338(h)(10) Election Transactions"). Each of Buyer and Sellers will
take no position inconsistent with such treatment or the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, if applicable, on any Income Tax Return or in any proceeding before
the IRS or any state and local Taxing Authority.

(f) Characterization of Payment. For all Tax purposes, the parties agree to
treat any and all payments under Section 2.4, and any indemnity payments made
between the parties pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the
purchase price.

(g) Elections.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Signing Date, Sellers
shall engage an accounting firm of nationally recognized standing (the
"Section 338(h)(10) Election Accounting Firm") to determine (i) the Tax basis,
for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes, of Sellers (or their relevant
Subsidiaries) in the stock of each of the Section 338(h)(10) Eligible
Subsidiaries (the "Stock Basis") and (ii) the Tax basis, for U.S. federal
Income Tax purposes, of each Section 338(h)(10) Eligible Subsidiary in its
assets (the "Asset Basis"). Sellers shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of
the status of the preparation of the Basis Information (as defined below), and
shall allow 

Buyer to consult with the Section 338(h)(10) Election Accounting Firm with
respect to its progress and determination. Sellers shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) to Buyer, no later than seventy-five (75) days after the Signing
Date, a statement setting forth the final Stock Basis and the Asset Basis,
together with any supporting documentation prepared by the Section 338(h)(10)
Election Accounting Firm to the extent reasonably necessary to allow Buyer to
meaningfully review the Stock Basis and the Asset Basis (such statement,
together with any such supporting documentation, the "Basis Information"). If
Buyer has any comments or disagrees with the calculation of Stock Basis or
Asset Basis, Buyer may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Basis
Information, deliver a written notice to Sellers to such effect, specifying
Buyer's comments to or those items as to which Buyer disagrees and setting
forth Buyer's proposed Stock Basis and/or Asset Basis, as applicable. If such
notice is duly and timely delivered, Buyer and Sellers shall, during the
thirty (30) days following such delivery, negotiate in good faith to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the Stock
Basis and/or Asset Basis, as applicable. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to
reach such agreement, then, no later than the expiration of the thirty (30)
day period described in the immediately preceding sentence, they shall submit
any remaining disputes to the Independent Accounting Firm and instruct the
Independent Accounting Firm to resolve such disputes within thirty (30) days
of such submission. Any costs and expenses of the Section 338(h)(10) Election
Accounting Firm and the Independent Accounting Firm incurred pursuant to this
Section 5.16(g)(i) shall be borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand. Within thirty (30) days of the later of (x)
Sellers' delivery of the Basis Information or, if applicable, the resolution
of any dispute with respect to the calculation of Stock Basis and/or Asset
Basis or (y) the completion of all reorganization and separation steps set
forth on the Separation Plan pursuant to Section 5.7(a), Buyer shall provide
written notice to Sellers stating whether it is electing to make joint
elections with Sellers under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
corresponding elections under applicable state or local Law) with respect to
any of the Section 338(h)(10) Eligible Subsidiaries (any such election, a
"Section 338(h)(10) Election"), which notice shall specify the Section
338(h)(10) Subsidiaries, if any. To the extent Buyer elects not to make a
Section 338(h)(10) Election with respect to any Section 338(h)(10) Eligible
Subsidiary (collectively, the "Stock Purchase Subsidiaries"), then there shall
be subtracted from the Final Purchase Price an amount equal to (A) the Basis
Adjustment Amount multiplied by (B) the quotient of 25.5% and 74.5% (the
"Section 338(h)(10) Election Amount").

(ii) Buyer and Sellers shall (and shall cause their relevant Affiliates to)
make and timely file the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, if any.

(iii) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, Buyer and
Sellers shall (and shall cause their relevant Affiliates to) cooperate in the
preparation of all forms, attachments and schedules necessary to effectuate
any Section 338(h)(10) Elections, including IRS Form 8023, IRS Form 8883 and
any similar forms under applicable state and local Law (such forms,
collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Forms"), in a manner 

consistent with the Final Allocation. Buyer and Sellers shall timely file (or
cause to be timely filed) the Section 338(h)(10) Forms with the applicable
Taxing Authorities.

(iv) Prior to the deadline for filing IRS Form 8023, Sellers and Buyer shall
each deliver to the other party one or more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 that
reflect any Section 338(h)(10) Elections (and any analogous forms required to
effectuate such Section 338(h)(10) Elections for state or local Tax purposes),
each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such other party.

(v) Buyer and Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
(A) report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
consistent with any Section 338(h)(10) Elections for all Tax purposes and (B)
except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state
or local Law), take no Tax position contrary to any Section 338(h)(10)
Elections or any Section 338(h)(10) Forms on any Tax Return, in any Tax
Proceeding or otherwise.

(vi) Buyer and Sellers shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
not to, take any action to (A) modify any of the forms or other documents
(including any corrections, amendments or supplements thereto) that are
required in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, if any, or (B)
modify or revoke any of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections after the filing of
the Section 338(h)(10) Forms without the prior written consent of the other
party.

(vii) With respect to any Acquired Entity that is properly classified as a
partnership and does not have in effect a valid election under Section 754 of
the Code for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, Sellers shall use reasonable
best efforts to request such Section 754 election be made for the Tax period
that includes the Closing Date.

(viii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.16(g), Buyer shall not, and shall not
cause or permit any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities after
the Closing) to (A) make or cause to be made any election with respect to any
Acquired Entity (including any entity classification election pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3) effective on or prior to the Closing
Date, (B) change or cause to be changed any method of Tax accounting or any
Tax accounting period of any Acquired Entity, which change has retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Period (or any portion thereof) or (C) take any
action or enter into any transaction on the Closing Date or after the Closing
that would reasonably be expected to increase any Tax liability (x) of any
Seller or any of its Affiliates (taking into account any indemnification
obligations pursuant to this Agreement) or (y) required to be reflected as a
reserve in Final Net Working Capital (or otherwise require any Tax liability
to be reflected as a reserve or Liability in Net Working Capital that would
not otherwise be required to be so reflected) for purposes of calculating the
Final Purchase Price. 

(h) Liability for Taxes.

(i) Sellers shall be liable for, shall pay (or cause to be paid) and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against, without duplication, (A)
all Taxes other than Taxes described in clause (B) imposed on the Acquired
Entities or Sellers with respect to the Business (1) for any Pre-Closing
Period, including any Taxes imposed on any Deemed Section 338(h)(10) Election
Transactions, and (2) with respect to any taxable period beginning on or
before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period"), for the portion of such Straddle Period ending at the close of the
day on the Closing Date, calculated in accordance with Section 5.16(h)(iii),
(B) Transfer Taxes for which Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section
5.16(b), (C) all Taxes of any Person (other than the Acquired Entities) as a
result of having been, prior to the Closing, part of any consolidated,
combined, affiliated, aggregate, unitary or similar group for purposes of
filing Tax Returns or paying Taxes (including any liability under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law) or as a transferee or successor or by contract (other than
(x) commercial agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business, the
principal purposes of which are not related to Taxes and (y) contracts entered
into after the Closing), (D) Excluded Business Taxes, (E) all Taxes resulting
from, arising out of or in connection with any breach or inaccuracy of any of
the representations and warranties of Sellers in Section 3.16, (F) except as
provided in Section 5.7(a)(y)(3), all Taxes imposed on the Separation
Activities and allocated to Sellers pursuant to Section 5.7(h), and (G) all
Taxes resulting from, arising out of or attributable to any breach by any
Seller of a covenant in this Agreement related to Taxes. In the event of any
conflict or inconsistency between any provision in this Section 5.16(h)(i) and
any provision in ARTICLE VIII, the provisions of this Section 5.16(h)(i) shall
control and govern; provided, however, that, other than with respect to
paragraphs (j) and (m) of Section 3.16, Sellers shall not have any
responsibility pursuant to this Section 5.16(h)(i) in respect of any Taxes
resulting from, arising out of or in connection with any breach or inaccuracy
of any of the representations and warranties of Sellers in Section 3.16 to the
extent such Taxes are attributable to any Tax period (or portion thereof, as
calculated in accordance with Section 5.16(h)(iii)) beginning after the
Closing Date.

(ii) Buyer shall be liable for, shall pay (or cause to be paid) and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against,
without duplication, (A) all Taxes imposed on the Acquired Entities or on
Buyer or any Acquired Entity in respect of the Business, (1) for any Post-
Closing Period and (2) with respect to any Straddle Period, for the portion of
such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, calculated in
accordance with Section 5.16(h)(iii), (B) Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is
responsible pursuant to Section 5.7(a)(y)(3), and (C) all Taxes resulting
from, arising out of or attributable to any breach by Buyer of a covenant in
this Agreement related to Taxes.

(iii) For purposes of this Section 5.16, to the greatest extent permitted by
Law or administrative practice, the parties shall cause the taxable year of
each of the Acquired Entities for purposes of any Tax to close on the Closing
Date. Whenever it is 

necessary to determine the liability for Taxes that are payable with respect
to a Straddle Period, except as provided in the following sentence, the amount
of any such Taxes (including franchise Taxes or other Taxes providing the
right to do business) that is allocable to the portion of such period ending
on the Closing Date shall be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable
if the taxable year ended on the Closing Date (for clarification purposes, an
interim closing of the books). In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis (including real and personal property Taxes) for a Straddle Period,
Sellers shall be liable for the product of the amount of such Taxes for the
Straddle Period and a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the applicable Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date, and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire applicable
Straddle Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the remaining amount of such
Taxes. For purposes of any Tax that is payable for a Straddle Period
(including real and personal property Taxes), Buyer shall be responsible for
the timely payment of such Taxes and Buyer shall notify Sellers of the
proration of such Taxes as set forth herein. To the extent any such Tax that
is payable for a Straddle Period is a Tax for which Sellers would otherwise
have an indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 5.16(h)(i) (for the
avoidance of doubt, taking into account Section 8.5 to the extent applicable),
Sellers shall pay to Buyer their allocable share of such Taxes within five (5)
days following receipt of the notice of billing. The parties agree that any
Tax deduction arising from or attributable to any payment of compensation or
benefits described in Section 5.2(j)(1) or Section 5.2(j)(2) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule shall be allocable to the Pre-Closing Period (or the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date), except to the
extent otherwise required under applicable Law (in which case, if Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Entities)
actually realize any Tax benefit as a result of any such payment of
compensation or benefits by any Seller or their respective Affiliates
(determined on a "with and without" basis), then Buyer shall pay to Sellers
the amount of such Tax benefit within fifteen (15) days after such Tax benefit
is actually realized).

(iv) Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Section 5.16, any
indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 5.16 shall be
made within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party gives notice to the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
8.4(a).

(i) Tax Returns.

(i) Sellers shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) (A) any Combined Tax
Return and (B) all Tax Returns (other than any Combined Tax Return) that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Acquired Entities for taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date (each Tax Return described in
this clause (B), a "Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return"). For any Pre-Closing
Separate Tax Return that is required to be filed after the Closing Date,
Sellers shall (x) prepare (or cause to be prepared) such Pre-Closing Separate
Tax Return in a manner consistent with past practice of or with respect to any
applicable Acquired Entity and (y) deliver to Buyer for its review and comment
a copy of any such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date therefor (or, in the case of any Pre-Closing Separate
Tax Return with respect to Taxes other than Income Taxes, at least ten (10)
days prior to the 

due date therefor) (in each case taking into account any extensions). Buyer
shall provide any comments on such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return to Sellers
within ten (10) days of receipt of any such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return
(or, in the case of any Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return with respect to Taxes
other than Income Taxes, within five (5) days of receipt thereof), and Sellers
shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments timely received from
Buyer. Sellers shall revise such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns to reflect
any comments received from Buyer which Sellers considered in good faith and
with which Sellers agree and shall deliver, if applicable, a revised Pre-
Closing Separate Tax Return to Buyer, and solely to the extent any Tax shown
on such revised Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return is a Tax for which Sellers
would otherwise have an indemnification obligation pursuant to Section
5.16(h)(i) (for the avoidance of doubt taking into account Section 8.5 to the
extent applicable), together with the payment of such Taxes as shown on any
such Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return. Buyer shall timely file or cause to be
timely filed any Tax Returns required to be filed by Buyer and submit or cause
to be submitted any payment due therewith. Except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law), Buyer
shall not amend or revoke any Combined Tax Return or any Pre-Closing Separate
Tax Return (or any notification or election relating thereto) without the
prior written consent of Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). At Sellers' reasonable request, Buyer shall
file, or cause to be filed, amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns;
provided, however, that Sellers shall have the same obligation to prepare and
Buyer shall have the same rights to review and comment on such amended Pre-
Closing Separate Tax Returns as described in this paragraph for the original
Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide (or cause to be provided) to Sellers any information
reasonably requested by Sellers to facilitate the preparation and filing of
any Tax Returns described in this Section 5.16(i)(i), and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to prepare (or cause to be prepared) such
information in a manner and on a reasonable timeline requested by Sellers,
which information and timeline shall be consistent with the past practice of
the Acquired Entities, as applicable. Subject to Section 8.5 to the extent
applicable, Sellers shall bear all Buyer's reasonable costs and expenses of
filing such amended Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns and providing and
preparing information as requested by Sellers pursuant to this Section
5.16(i)(i).

(ii) Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be
filed) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
Acquired Entities, the Business or the Acquired Assets for taxable periods
ending after the Closing Date and all Tax Returns that relate to a Straddle
Period. With respect to any such Tax Return reflecting any amounts for which
Sellers are liable pursuant to Section 5.16(h)(i), Buyer shall (A) prepare (or
cause to be prepared) such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past
practice of or with respect to any applicable Acquired Entity and (B) deliver
to Sellers for their review, comment and approval, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date therefor (or, in the case of any Tax Return with respect
to Taxes other than Income Taxes, at least ten (10) days prior to the due date
therefor) (in each case, taking into account any applicable extensions), a
statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which Sellers are responsible
pursuant to Section 5.16(h)(i) and a copy of such Tax Return, 

together with any additional information that Sellers may reasonably request.
Sellers shall have the right to review such Tax Return, statement and
additional information, if any, prior to the filing of such Tax Return, and
Buyer shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments submitted by
Sellers within ten (10) days of receipt of any such Tax Return (or, in the
case of any such Tax Return with respect to Taxes other than Income Taxes,
within five (5) days of receipt thereof) (in each case taking into account any
applicable extensions). Buyer shall revise such Tax Return to reflect any
comments received from Sellers which Buyer considered in good faith and with
which Buyer agrees and shall deliver, if applicable, a revised Tax Return to
Sellers, and Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed such Tax
Return. If Buyer does not agree with any such comments, Buyer shall promptly
notify Sellers of such disagreement, and Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate in
good faith to resolve such disagreement. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to
resolve such disagreement within fifteen (15) days of Buyer's notification
thereof (or, in the case of any such Tax Return with respect to Taxes other
than Income Taxes, within such shorter period as is reasonable), Buyer and
Sellers shall submit such disagreement to the Independent Accounting Firm and
shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute within
thirty (30) days of such submission (or, in the case of any such Tax Return
with respect to Taxes other than Income Taxes, within such shorter period as
is reasonable). The Independent Accounting Firm's resolution of such dispute
shall be binding upon Buyer and Sellers, and Buyer and Sellers shall bear the
fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in resolving such dispute
equally. Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of
state, local or non-U.S. Law), Buyer shall not amend or revoke any Tax Return
reflecting any amounts for which Sellers are liable pursuant to Section
5.16(h)(i) (or any notification or election relating thereto) within the prior
written consent of Sellers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). At Seller's reasonable request, Buyer shall file, or
cause to be filed, amended Tax Return reflecting any amounts for which Seller
is liable pursuant to Section 5.16(h)(i); provided, however, that any such Tax
Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with this Section 5.16(i)(ii).
In the case of any amended Tax Return filed pursuant to the previous sentence,
subject to Section 8.5 to the extent applicable, Sellers shall bear all
Buyer's reasonable costs and expenses of filing any such amended Tax Return
and providing and preparing information as requested by Sellers pursuant to
this Section 5.16(i)(ii).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers and their
respective Affiliates shall not be required to provide Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Entities) with any Tax
Return or a copy of any Tax Return of (A) any Seller or any of such Seller's
Subsidiaries other than an Acquired Entity or (B) any consolidated,
affiliated, fiscal, loss sharing, combined or similar group of which any
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than an Acquired Entity) is a member
(including any Combined Tax Return).

(j) Tax Refunds. Sellers shall be entitled to retain, or receive prompt
payment from Buyer or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the
Acquired Entities) of, any refund (including any credit in lieu of a refund)
of Taxes for which Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 5.16(h),
including any interest paid thereon, received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer
or 

the Acquired Entities, no later than ten (10) days following receipt of such
refund (or, in the case of a credit obtained in lieu of such refund, no later
than ten (10) days following the filing of the Income Tax Return on which such
credit is used to offset tax otherwise payable), net of any out-of-pocket
costs incurred in obtaining such refund or credit (including any Income Taxes
impose thereon); provided, however, that to the extent any such refund to
which Sellers have been entitled pursuant to this Section 5.16(j) is
subsequently disallowed by a Governmental Entity, Sellers shall pay to Buyer
such amount that has been subsequently disallowed in addition to any out-of-
pocket costs incurred by Buyer attempting to prevent or contest such
disallowance, no later than ten (10) days prior to the date that such refund
must be paid to the relevant Governmental Entity (taking into account
extensions). Any refunds or credits of the Acquired Entities for any Straddle
Period shall be equitably apportioned between Sellers and Buyer in accordance
with the principles set forth in Section 5.16(h)(iii).

(k) Tax Proceedings.

(i) If any Governmental Entity asserts a claim with respect to Taxes that, if
pursued successfully, would reasonably be expected to serve as the basis for a
claim for indemnification under Section 5.16(h) (a "Tax Claim"), then the
party first receiving notice for such Tax Claim promptly shall provide written
notice thereof to the other party; provided, however, that the failure of such
party to give such prompt notice shall not relieve the other party of any of
its obligations under this Section 5.16, except to the extent that the other
party is materially and actually prejudiced by such failure (as determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction). Such notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant
portion of any correspondence received from the Governmental Entity.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

(A)Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities) shall have
the exclusive right to control any Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of
the Acquired Entities for any Pre-Closing Period; provided that, with respect
to a Pre-Closing Period that would reasonably be expected to increase or give
rise to a liability of Buyer or any Acquired Entity for Taxes related to a
Post-Closing Period, Sellers shall not settle or compromise any such Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, further, that, if
Sellers elect not to control the conduct and resolution of any such Tax
Proceeding, Sellers shall notify Buyer in writing, and Buyer shall have the
right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Proceeding, or portion
thereof, that is not controlled by Sellers; and

(B) Buyer shall have the right to control any Tax Proceeding of or with
respect to any of the Acquired Entities for any Post-Closing Period or that
relates to any Tax Return or Tax for a Straddle Period, provided, however,
that, in the case of any Tax Proceeding with respect to a Straddle 

Period or any Tax Proceeding for any Post-Closing Period that would reasonably
be expected to give rise to a liability of Sellers for Taxes (including
pursuant to this Agreement), Buyer shall defend such Tax Proceeding diligently
and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in connection with
such Tax Proceeding and Sellers shall have the right, at their own expense, to
participate in and consult with Buyer regarding any such Tax Proceeding to the
extent that such Tax Proceeding relates to any Acquired Entity or Acquired
Asset, such participation and consultation rights to include the right to
receive a reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding,
and to consult with Buyer before Buyer takes any significant action or submits
any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such Tax
Proceeding. Buyer shall not settle any Tax Proceeding that relates to any Tax
Return or Tax (x) for a Straddle Period or (y) for a Post-Closing Period if
such Tax Proceeding would reasonably be expected to give rise to a liability
of Sellers for Taxes (including pursuant to this Agreement), in the case of
each of clauses (x) and (y), without the prior written consent of Sellers,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sellers
shall have the exclusive right to control, and neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding with
respect to (A) any Tax Return of any Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Acquired Entities) or (B) any Tax Return of a consolidated,
affiliated, fiscal, loss sharing, combined or similar group of which any
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than an Acquired Entity) is a member
(including any Combined Tax Return).

(l) Like-Kind Exchange. Sellers shall have the right to structure all or part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a simultaneous or
deferred (reverse) exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (a "Like-Kind Exchange").
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in connection with
effectuating a Like-Kind Exchange, Sellers shall have the right, at or prior
to the Closing Date, to assign all or a portion of its rights under this
Agreement to a "qualified intermediary" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)), a "qualified exchange accommodation
titleholder" (within the meaning of Revenue Procedure 2000-37), or another
person reasonably selected by Sellers for the purpose of satisfying the
requirements of Section 1031 of the Code. Should Sellers choose to effectuate
a Like-Kind Exchange, the parties agree to cooperate with one another in the
completion of such an exchange, including the execution of all documents
reasonably necessary to effectuate a Like-Kind Exchange; provided, however,
that (a) the Closing Date shall not be delayed, prohibited, prevented or
restricted by reason of the Like-Kind Exchange and (b) Buyer shall incur no
additional unreimbursed costs, expenses, fees or liabilities as a result of or
in connection with the Like-Kind Exchange. Sellers do hereby and shall
release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer against any and all costs
and expenses reasonably incurred with respect to or in connection with the
Like-Kind Exchange.

(m) Tax Clearance Certificates. 

(i) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from the applicable Taxing Authority in jurisdictions that impose Taxes
on any of the Acquired Entities with respect to a Business or where any of the
Acquired Entities has a duty to file Tax Returns with respect to a Business,
to the extent such certificates are issued by an applicable state-level Taxing
Authority, tax clearance or similar certificates evidencing such Acquired
Entity's compliance with and satisfaction of its Tax obligations in such
jurisdictions ("Tax Clearance Certificates" ).

(ii) Following the Closing, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to promptly do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with Buyer to obtain all Tax
Clearance Certificates referred to in Section 5.16(m)(i) that were not
obtained prior to Closing.

(n) Motor Fuel Inventory. As soon as practicable, Sellers shall use reasonable
best efforts to resolve all ongoing or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, potential
Tax Proceedings with respect to the motor fuel Inventory of the Business.

(o) Coordination and Survival. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, indemnification and other payments in respect of Taxes and the
procedures relating thereto shall be governed exclusively by this Section 5.16
and Section 8.1(a), Section 8.4(a), Section 8.4(b) (first three sentences),
Section 8.5 (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Section 8.5(a)(i) and
Section 8.5(a)(ii)), Section 8.6, and Section 9.4, and the provisions of
ARTICLE VIII (other than Section 8.1(a), Section 8.4(a), Section 8.4(b) (first
three sentences), Section 8.5 (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Section
8.5(a)(i) and Section 8.5(a)(ii)) and Section 8.6) shall not apply. The
indemnification and other payment obligations contained in this Section 5.16
shall survive the Closing Date until sixty (60) days following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations; provided that if written notice of a
claim has been given to the indemnifying or paying party in good faith prior
to the end of the applicable survival period, then the indemnification or
payment obligations with respect to such claim shall survive until such claim
is finally resolved. The covenants and agreements in this Section 5.16 shall
survive the Closing until fully performed.

Section 5.17 Officers', Directors' and Managers' Indemnification. From and
after the Closing Date, for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date,
Buyer (a) shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Entities not to, except (and
then only) to the extent otherwise required by then applicable Law, modify the
provisions in the Acquired Entities' (or any successor's) Organizational
Documents in existence on the Signing Date or any agreement providing for
indemnification by any Acquired Entity in effect on the Signing Date, each as
set forth on Section 5.17 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, so as to reduce,
limit or otherwise adversely affect the rights with respect to (i) the
elimination of liability of current or former directors, officers, members or
managers on or prior to the Closing, (ii) indemnification of current or former
officers, managers, directors and employees of the Acquired Entities (in all
of their official capacities), as such provisions apply to any current or
former officers, managers, directors and employees of the Acquired Entities
prior to the Closing (the "Covered Parties") and (iii) advancement of expenses
to any Covered Parties contained in the Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Entities and (b) cause the 

Acquired Entities to comply with all such provisions and/or agreements. In the
event any claim or claims are asserted or made pursuant to the indemnification
rights set forth in this Section 5.17, all rights to indemnification in
respect of any such claim or claims shall continue to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the applicable Organizational Documents and/or agreements.
Any determination required to be made with respect to whether a Covered
Party's conduct complies with the applicable standard of conduct which governs
the availability of such indemnification shall be made by independent legal
counsel selected by the Covered Party and reasonably acceptable to Buyer.
Sellers shall cause the Acquired Entities to, at Sellers' request and sole
expense, obtain at or prior to the Closing Date a six (6) year "tail" policy
with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance providing
equivalent coverage as Sellers' and the Acquired Entities' existing
policy(ies).

Section 5.18 Notification of Certain Events. From the Signing Date until the
earlier to occur of (a) termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of
ARTICLE VII and (b) the Closing, each of Sellers and Buyer agrees to promptly
notify the other in writing of (x) any fact, event or circumstance that
becomes known to it that could reasonably be expected, either individually or
when taken together with any or all other existing facts, events and
circumstances known to it, to result in the failure of any of the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE VI to be satisfied, (y) any written notice or other
written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and (z) any written notice or other written communication from any
Governmental Entity (other than those to which Section 5.5 applies) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that
the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this Section 5.18 shall not, in
and of itself, be considered in determining whether the conditions set forth
in Section 6.2(b) or Section 6.3(b), as applicable, have been satisfied.

Section 5.19 Litigation Cooperation.

(a) Following the Closing Date, except (x) as the parties may otherwise agree
pursuant to Section 8.4 or (y) Actions set forth on Section 5.19 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, (i) Buyer shall have exclusive authority and control over
the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of all then pending Actions
primarily relating to or arising in connection with the Business, any Acquired
Assets or any Assumed Liabilities (each, a "Buyer Controlled Action"), and may
settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
any such Buyer Controlled Action without the consent of Sellers (as long as
such settlement, compromise or judgment (A) does not impose any liability or
obligation on any Seller or any of its Affiliates, (B) does not involve an
admission of wrongdoing by any Seller or any of its Affiliates and (C) would
not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on the reputation
of, or implicate the goodwill of, any Seller or any of its Affiliates, and in
the case that any of (A) through (C) above are true, the prior written consent
of Sellers will be required (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed)), and (ii) Sellers shall have exclusive authority and
control over the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of all then
pending Actions primarily relating to or arising in connection with the
Excluded Business, Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities (each, a "Seller
Controlled Action"), and may settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any such Seller Controlled Action without the
consent of Buyer (as long as such settlement, compromise or judgment 

(A) does not impose any liability or obligation on Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, (B) does not involve an admission of wrongdoing by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates and (C) would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse impact on the reputation of, or implicate the goodwill of, Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the Acquired Entities,
and in the case that any of (A) through (C) above are true, the prior written
consent of Buyer will be required (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed)). For the avoidance of doubt, each Action
pending following the Closing Date shall be either a Buyer Controlled Action
or a Seller Controlled Action, and no such Action will be both a Buyer
Controlled Action and a Seller Controlled Action. As soon as practicable
following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities to,
use reasonable best efforts to have any Seller and any Seller Indemnified
Parties removed as parties to any Buyer Controlled Action in which they are
named parties as soon as is reasonably practicable, and Sellers shall, and
shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to have
any Acquired Entity removed as a party to any Seller Controlled Action in
which they are named parties as soon as is reasonably practicable.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer shall use, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to make
available to each other, upon written request, their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents for fact finding, consultation and interviews
and as witnesses to the extent that any such Person may reasonably be required
in connection with any Actions in which the requesting party may from time to
time be involved relating to the Buyer Controlled Actions or Seller Controlled
Actions or the conduct of the Business or the Excluded Businesses. Each of
Sellers and Buyer agrees to retain, and provide the other party with
reasonable access to (including the right to make copies) to, all books and
records in their respective possession relating to any Buyer Controlled Action
or any Seller Controlled Action until such Action is fully and finally
resolved. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the provisions of this Section 5.19 shall not apply to Actions
brought between any Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities), on the other hand.

Section 5.20 Release of Guarantees.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate and shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to, terminate or cause to be
terminated, or cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all
respects for any Seller and any Retained Subsidiary (collectively, the "Seller
Guarantors") in respect of all obligations of Seller Guarantors under, or
replace or cause to be replaced, effective as of the Closing Date, any Seller
Guaranties and in each case obtain from the creditor or other counterparty to
each Seller Guaranty a full and irrevocable release of the Seller Guarantors
that are liable, directly or indirectly, to such creditor in respect of such
Seller Guaranty. Subject to Sellers' payment and other obligations in Section
5.7, none of Sellers, Seller Parent, Buyer nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be required to make any payment or incur any out of pocket
cost to obtain the foregoing terminations, substitutions or replacements of
any Seller Guaranties.

(b) In the event the actions provided for in Section 5.20(a) above are not
completed by the Closing Date, from and after the Closing, Sellers and Buyer
shall continue to 

cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to terminate, or
cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for
Seller Guarantors in respect of all obligations of Seller Guarantors under, or
replace or cause to be replaced, any such Seller Guaranties and in each case
obtain from the creditor or other counterparty to each Seller Guaranty a full
and irrevocable release of the Seller Guarantors that are liable, directly or
indirectly, to such creditor in respect of such Seller Guaranty, and Buyer
shall (i) not and shall not permit the Business, the Acquired Entities or its
Affiliates to (A) renew or extend the term of or (B) amend any contract to
increase the obligations under, or transfer to another third party, any
Contract or other obligation for which any Seller Guarantor is or would
reasonably be expected to be liable under such Seller Guaranty and (ii)
indemnify and hold harmless Seller Guarantors from and against all Liabilities
under any such Seller Guaranties; provided, however, that Sellers complied
with their obligations pursuant to Section 5.20(a) with respect to such Seller
Guarantee. To the extent that any Seller Guarantor continues to have any
performance obligations under any such Seller Guaranty (including any such
Seller Guaranty in respect of any Acquired Assets that are assigned,
transferred or conveyed after the Closing pursuant to Section 5.7) on or after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (x) perform, or
cause its Affiliates to perform, such obligations on behalf of such Seller
Guarantor or (y) otherwise take such action as reasonably requested by Sellers
so as to put such Seller Guarantor in the same position as if Buyer or one of
its Affiliates, and not such Seller Guarantor, had performed or were
performing such obligations.

Section 5.21 Governance Matters. The parties agree to comply with the
obligations set forth on Section 5.21 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

Section 5.22 Financial Information.

(a) Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare and deliver to Buyer
the Unaudited Financial Statements within ninety (90) days following the
Signing Date. Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to prepare and
deliver to Buyer not later than thirty (30) days or, with respect to annual
results, sixty (60) days following the date on which Seller Parent or any
Seller announces its financial and operating results for each quarterly or
annual fiscal period ending between the Signing Date and the Closing Date (and
in any event, Sellers shall prepare and deliver not later than sixty (60) days
for quarterly and ninety (90) days for annual after the end of such quarterly
or annual fiscal period), Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) (A)
as of the end of such quarterly fiscal period, an unaudited balance sheet of
the Business and (B) as of the end of such annual fiscal period, an audited
balance sheet of the Business and (ii) (A) for the fiscal quarter ended as of
the end of such quarterly period, unaudited statements of operations,
statements of change in net investment of the Business and (B) for the fiscal
year ended as of the end of such annual period, audited statements of cash
flows of the Business (collectively with the Unaudited Financial Statements,
the "Interim Financial Statements"); provided that (x) with respect to any
such quarterly fiscal period ended more than forty-five (45) days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver such Interim Financial Statements not later
than fifteen (15) days prior to Closing and (y) with respect to any such
annual fiscal period ended more than ninety (90) days prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers shall deliver such Interim Financial Statements not later than
fifteen (15) days prior to Closing. Other than as set forth on Section 3.10 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Interim Financial Statements shall be (x)
in the same format (or similar format) and include 

the same level of detail as the Audited Financial Statements, (y) derived from
the books and records of the Acquired Entities or Sellers (to the extent
related to the Business) in accordance with the Transaction Accounting
Principles and (z) shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto); provided
that the Interim Financial Statements may be subject to normal year-end
adjustments. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers shall be required to deliver
Interim Financial Statements in accordance with this Section 5.22 for each
fiscal quarter or year completed prior to the Closing Date, even if the
delivery obligation under this Section 5.22 would not be required to be
completed until after the Closing Date.

(b) Until the Closing occurs or this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer on or prior to the
thirtieth (30th) day after each month end, a report in substantially the form
attached to Section 5.22(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Sellers shall be responsible for any and all costs and expenses incurred
relating to the preparation or delivery of the Interim Financial Statements
and the reports required by this Section 5.22.

Section 5.23 Exclusivity. From the Signing Date until the earlier to occur of
(a) termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof
and (b) the Closing, Seller Parent shall, and each of Seller and Seller Parent
shall cause its respective controlled Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives, not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate,
entertain, consider, encourage, respond to or accept the submission of any
proposal, inquiry or offer from any third party relating to the acquisition
(whether by merger, purchase of stock, purchase of assets or otherwise) of all
or a significant portion of the Business or the Acquired Assets (other than
Inventory and Equipment in the Ordinary Course of Business) or (ii) initiate,
engage in or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish
any information (including by providing access to the books, records, assets,
business or personnel of any Seller or the Acquired Entities) with respect to,
assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any third party to do or
seek any of the foregoing. Each Seller and Seller Parent shall, and shall
cause its respective controlled Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and suspend any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with respect to the sale of the Business with any
third party other than Buyer and to request that all confidential information
previously furnished to any such Person in connection therewith be returned or
destroyed promptly. For the avoidance of doubt, no action taken by any Seller
or Seller Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives in
furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or relating to
a transaction involving all or substantially all of Seller Parent shall be a
breach of this Section 5.23; provided, nothing set forth in this Section 5.23
shall relieve any Seller, Seller Parent or any of their respective successors
or assigns of any of their obligations under this Agreement.

Section 5.24 Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy. Buyer has bound and
delivered to Sellers the draft representation and warranty insurance policy
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D to this Agreement (the "RandW
Insurance Policy") as of the Signing Date. Subject to the last sentence of
this Section 5.24, Buyer shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
complete the applicable conditions in the conditional binder (other than the 

condition that the Closing has occurred and Sellers' obligations under this
Section 5.24) to the RandW Insurance Policy within the times set forth in the
RandW Insurance Policy to maintain the RandW Insurance Policy in full force and
effect. Following the final issuance of the RandW Insurance Policy, Buyer agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the RandW Insurance Policy in
full force and effect for the policy period set forth in such policy. Upon its
final issuance, Buyer shall deliver the RandW Insurance Policy to Sellers. Buyer
acknowledges that Buyer obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy is a material
inducement to Sellers entering into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Sellers are relying on Buyer's covenants and obligations set
forth in this Section 5.24. In addition, the RandW Insurance Policy may not be
amended or waived by Buyer in any manner that is adverse to any Seller or any
of its Affiliates without such Seller's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the
subrogation provisions therein may not be amended or waived in any manner that
is adverse to any Seller or any of its Affiliates without such Seller's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) provided, however, that any (x) Interim Breach (as defined in the
RandW Insurance Policy) or (y) reduction in the scope of matters insured arising
from the operation of the terms and conditions of the RandW Insurance Policy in
effect as of the date hereof shall be deemed not to be such an adverse
amendment or waiver. In the event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates
otherwise amends, waives, modifies or cancels the terms of the RandW Insurance
Policy, in no event shall any Seller be liable under this Agreement for any
liabilities or obligations in excess of such liabilities or obligations as
they would have under this Agreement if the RandW Insurance Policy in the form
as of the Signing Date had not been so amended, waived, modified or cancelled.
Sellers shall pay all of the underwriting costs, deposit, premium and taxes
with respect to the RandW Insurance Policy at the Closing.

Section 5.25 Environmental Insurance Policy. Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain an Environmental Insurance Policy and cause coverage
thereunder to be in effect as of the Closing Date, and each Seller shall use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all
actions reasonably necessary and proper, and to promptly do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate in good faith with Buyer in obtaining such
Environmental Insurance Policy, including by (x) providing any information
reasonably requested by Buyer of the provider of such Environmental Insurance
Policy in connection therewith, in accordance with the provisions of Section
5.3 and (y) using reasonable best efforts to provide Buyer with access to all
written Phase I environmental reports for any Retail Site conducted during the
five (5) year period prior to the Signing Date (the "Business Environmental
Reports") in the possession of Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Acquired Entities) within sixty (60) days of the Signing Date.
Upon final issuance of the Environmental Insurance Policy, Buyer shall deliver
to Sellers a copy thereof. Sellers shall pay when due the underwriting costs,
deposit, premium and taxes arising out of or incurred with respect to the
Environmental Insurance Policy, not in excess of $10,000,000. In the event
that the Environmental Insurance Policy is not in full force and effect at
Closing, then Sellers shall pay at Closing to Buyer an amount equal to
$10,000,000; provided that, in no event shall Sellers pay Buyer an amount in
excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate under this Section 5.25.

Section 5.26 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation. The restrictive covenants
contained in this Section 5.26 are intended and necessary to protect the
Business, the Acquired Entities, the 

Acquired Assets and other interests and rights being acquired by Buyer under
this Agreement as well as the other legitimate business interests of Buyer,
the Acquired Entities and their respective Affiliates.

(a) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the fourth
(4th) anniversary thereof, except as expressly permitted under this Section
5.26, neither Seller Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Restricted Parties"), directly or indirectly, shall engage in the business of
owning, leasing or operating convenience stores or any facility that sells
motor fuels on a retail basis to consumers (collectively, "Restricted
Activities") in the geographic territories set forth on Section 5.26(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (the "Restricted Area"), nor shall any Restricted
Party, directly or indirectly, have any ownership interest in, participate in
or act as a consultant or lender to (as a member, principal, licensor,
trustee, broker, agent, stockholder or partner), operate, assist, represent,
advise or otherwise provide financial support to, any Person that engages in
the Restricted Activities in the Restricted Area.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything else contained in this
Agreement to the contrary but subject to Section 5.26(d), the restrictions in
Section 5.26(a) shall not apply to:

(i) owning four percent (4%) or less of the outstanding publicly-traded
securities of any Person so long as such ownership is a passive investment;

(ii) acquiring (or entering into an agreement to acquire) and, after such
acquisition, owning an interest in any Person (or its successor) (measured on
a consolidated basis with such Person's Affiliates acquired in such
transaction or series of related transactions) that is engaged in a business
activity that would otherwise violate Section 5.26(a) (a "Competing Business")
if (A) all such Competing Businesses generated less than twenty-five percent
(25%) of such Person's consolidated annual revenues for the prior twelve (12)
months and (B) regardless of whether the four (4) year period has expired, any
Seller enters, within eighteen (18) months after the consummation of such
acquisition, into a definitive agreement to cause the divestiture of all or
substantially all of the Competing Business of such Person and completes such
disposition within twenty-four (24) months of the date of such definitive
agreement;

(iii) complying with its obligations under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreements or engaging in any activities at the Business Real Property
consented to in writing by Buyer or its Affiliates; or

(iv) owning, operating or engaging in the Excluded Businesses; provided that
solely with respect to Excluded Businesses that are engaging in direct or
indirect ownership or operation of convenience stores or facilities that sell
motor fuels on a retail basis to consumers (other than Excluded Retail
Operations), such ownership, operation or engagement shall be in a manner
consistent in all material respects with current practice and at the same
level and scope as currently conducted; provided, 

however, notwithstanding the foregoing proviso, the Restricted Parties may (A)
operate a branded jobber or distributor business, (B) provide direct loans or
other financial support to its branded jobber and distributor customers, (C)
participate with their branded jobber or distributor customer business
(provided such participation involves 100 stores or fewer), (D) operate a
franchised location on a temporary basis or (E) operate through a direct
dealer channel (provided that any operation through a direct dealer channel
after the Closing shall not involve financing or leasing of any real property
to unaffiliated third parties, other than in the properties financed or leased
by Seller Parent and its Affiliates as of the date hereof (clauses (A) through
(E), the "Excluded Retail Operations")).

(c) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the third
(3rd) anniversary thereof, none of the Restricted Parties shall, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage,
cause, induce to hire or hire, interfere in the business relationship of or
enter into an employment agreement, consulting agreement or service
relationship with any Business Employee set forth on Section 5.26(c) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule. The foregoing restrictions shall not preclude
general solicitations in newspapers or similar mass media not targeted towards
Business Employees, the Acquired Entities or their respective Affiliates or
apply to any individual who has not been employed by the Acquired Entities
within the six months preceding any such action.

(d) Buyer shall have a purchase option ("ROFO") on each Competing Business in
the event any Restricted Party seeks to sell, franchise or divest all or any
portion of such Competing Business or convert any portion of such Competing
Business to be commissioned-marketer operated pursuant to Section 5.26(b)(ii)
(each such event, a "ROFO Event"). Prior to any Restricted Party seeking to
effect any such ROFO Event, such Restricted Party shall offer to Buyer the
right to purchase such Competing Business through a notice to Buyer of such
intent (a "ROFO Notice"), which notice shall contain, among other information,
the price for such Competing Business (which price shall be equal to the
allocated value of the Competing Business based on the allocated purchase
price of the applicable acquisition transaction identified in Section
5.26(b)(ii)). Buyer shall be entitled either (i) to accept the offer at the
price set forth in the ROFO Notice, in which case such Restricted Party shall
be obligated to consummate the sale to Buyer at such price; or (ii) to make an
offer by sending a response notice to such Restricted Party within thirty (30)
days of receipt of such ROFO Notice (a "Offer Notice"), which notice shall
contain the material terms and conditions (including the price and form of
consideration that Buyer is willing to pay (the "Offer Price")). If no Offer
Notice is timely sent, Buyer's ROFO, solely with respect to such ROFO Event
that is the subject of such ROFO Notice, shall expire and such Restricted
Party shall be permitted to sell or franchise all, but not less than all, of
the Competing Business covered by such ROFO Notice to a third party or convert
all, but not less than all, of such Competing Business to be commissioned-
marketer operated by a third party. If the applicable Restricted Party rejects
Buyer's offer, such Restricted Party shall be permitted to sell, franchise or
otherwise divest all, but not less than all, of such Competing Business to a
third party or convert all, but not less than all, of such Competing Business
to be a commissioned marketer operated by a third party (a "Divestiture
Event"); provided that if the price and form of 

consideration offered by a proposed acquirer, franchisee or commissioned
marketer shall be equal or less than the Offer Price (taking into
consideration the form of consideration) (the "New Price")), such Restricted
Party shall send a notice to Buyer of its intention to effect a Divestiture
Event (a "Sale Notice")). Buyer shall have the right to purchase such
Competing Business or such portion of the Competing Business covered by the
Sale Notice at the New Price by sending a response notice to such Restricted
Party within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such Sale Notice, which
notice shall specify that Buyer is willing and able to purchase such portion
of the Competing Business on the same material terms and conditions (including
the New Price) set forth in the Sale Notice. If no such response notice is
timely sent, Buyer's sale right, solely with respect to such offer in respect
of such Divestiture Event that is subject to such Sale Notice, shall expire,
and such Restricted Party may either sell, franchise or otherwise divest all,
but not less than all, of such Competing Business to any third party on the
terms set forth in the Sale Notice. If Buyer elects to exercise its ROFO with
respect to any such ROFO Event or exercise its sale right with respect to any
such Divestiture Event, such Restricted Party shall be obligated to consummate
such Divestiture Event with Buyer, and Buyer and such Restricted Party shall
negotiate in good faith and cooperate in promptly preparing definitive
documentation and consummating such transactions.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Section
5.26 shall be applicable (x) to any Person or any of its Affiliates (other
than Seller Parent and its Subsidiaries) that acquires a material interest in
Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement or
(y) to any Person as of and following such time that such Person ceases to be
a Subsidiary or Affiliate of Seller Parent.

Section 5.27 Cooperation.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities
to, use their reasonable best efforts to, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause Sellers' and the Acquired Entities' respective
Representatives to, provide to Buyer such customary cooperation as is

"Debt Financing"), including using reasonable best efforts to:

comply with Sellers' and the Acquired Entities' usage requirements to the
extent made available to Buyer prior to the Signing Date; and

(vii) cause Sellers' independent auditors to provide customary cooperation

Debt Financing that Buyer is arranging.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.27(a) above or
Section 5.27(d) below, (i) none of Sellers, nor the Acquired Entities nor any
of their respective Representatives shall be required to take or permit the
taking of any action pursuant to this Section 5.27 to (A) pay any commitment
or other fee or incur any liability, (B) execute or deliver any definitive
financing documents or any other agreement, certificate, affidavit, document,
evidence or instrument, or agree to any change to or modification of any
existing agreement, certificate, document or instrument (other than, solely in
the case of the Acquired Entities, documents, agreements, certificates,
instruments, changes or modifications are effective only upon and after the
Closing; provided that in no event shall any officer or director of an
Acquired Entity be required to execute or deliver any such document,
agreement, certificate, instrument,

after the Closing and is signing in such capacity), (C) provide access to or

5.22 above, (ii) none of Sellers', the Acquired Entities' or any of their
Subsidiaries' boards of directors or officers shall be required to adopt
resolutions or consents approving the agreements, documents or instruments
pursuant to which the Debt Financing is obtained or any Monetization
Transactions are arranged or consummated other than the boards of directors or

extent that they will remain in such positions after the Closing and (iii)
none of Sellers, the Acquired Entities nor any of their Subsidiaries nor any
of their respective Representatives shall be required to take or permit the
taking of any action that would (w) interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of Sellers or the Acquired Entities, (x) cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by Sellers or the
Acquired Entities, (y) cause any director, officer or employee or shareholder
or other Representative of any Seller or the Acquired Entities to incur any
personal liability or (z) result in a violation or breach of, or a default

any applicable Law. Buyer shall cause all non-public or other confidential
information provided by or on behalf of Sellers, the Acquired Entities or any
of their Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.27 to be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) (i) Buyer will promptly, upon request by Sellers, reimburse Sellers, the
Acquired Entities and any of their Subsidiaries, as applicable, for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt

indirectly, in connection with the Debt Financing, any Monetization
Transaction, any alternative financing, any actions taken under this Section
5.27 or any information provided in connection therewith (other than any
information provided in writing by or on behalf of Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection with the Debt Financing that
is inaccurate or misleading), in each case other than to the extent any of
such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, expenses (including attorneys'
fees), interest, judgements or penalties arise from Sellers', the Acquired
Entities' or any of their Subsidiaries' and their respective directors',
officers' and Representatives' gross negligence or willful misconduct, as
determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) whether or not the
Closing is consummated or this Agreement is terminated.

(d) In the event Buyer elects, in connection with arranging, obtaining and
syndicating any of the Debt Financing or the sale or other monetization of any
Owned Real 

Property to be effected contemporaneously with or following the Effective Time

lender's) title insurance policies (or bring-downs of or endorsements to any
of the existing title insurance policies, if available) from a nationally
recognized title company selected by Buyer, in amounts determined by Buyer or
counterparty to a Monetization Transaction, insuring the Acquired Entity's (or
the applicable counterparty's) interest in and to any of the Owned Real
Property, free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) or (ii) ALTA surveys of any Owned Real Property (or updates to
existing ALTA surveys, if applicable) from one or more licensed surveyors
selected by Buyer, sufficient to allow the title company to remove the "survey

applicable Owned Real Properties at times reasonably acceptable to Sellers and
upon reasonable notice. For purposes of this provision, all Leased Real
Property that is leased pursuant to a ground lease shall be deemed to be Owned
Real Property. Buyer shall be solely responsible for the costs and expenses of
the title policies, the surveys and any related item under this Section
5.27(d).

Section 5.28 Condemnation.

(a) If all or any part of any Retail Site (x) that contributed revenue to 2019
or 2020 operations of the Business (other than any Retail Sites set forth on
Section 3.15(i)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and any Planned Closing
Retail Sites) (y) is taken, or noticed or threatened for taking by eminent
domain (each, a "Condemnation Action"), Sellers shall, with respect to all
Condemnation Actions which occurred between January 1, 2019 and the Closing

or its Subsidiaries prior to Closing to correct or mitigate for such Partial
Condemnation Action) actually received by Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing Date as a result of the Partial
Condemnation Actions. If an Acquired Entity does not already have the right to
receive any future proceeds received in respect of any Partial Condemnation
Action or Total Condemnation Action, Sellers shall cause such right to be
assigned to the applicable Acquired Entity and shall remit to such Acquired
Entity any such proceeds received by any Seller.

(b) With respect to any Condemnation Action (x) involving a Retail Site that
contributed revenue to 2019 or 2020 operations of the Business (other than any
Retail Sites set 

forth on Section 3.15(i)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and any Planned
Closing Retail Sites) and (y) that occurred between January 1, 2019 and the
Closing Date that results in either the front court or back court of the
applicable Retail Site (i) being not operational and closed as of the Closing
Date (including, in the event of any Condemnation Action impacting a Leased
Real Property, (1) if the applicable landlord has the right to terminate the
applicable Real Property Lease as a result thereof (and such right has not
been exercised or waived and the time period, if any, for exercising such
right has not expired and does not expire prior to the Closing) and (2) if the
applicable landlord validly exercises a right to terminate the applicable Real
Property Lease as a result thereof prior to Closing), or (ii) the Condemnation
Action reduces the value of the applicable Retail Site by forty percent (40%)
or more (any such Condemnation Action described in clause (i) or (ii), a
"Total Condemnation Action") then in each case, Sellers shall pay to Buyer for
each such Retail Site the applicable amount as set forth on Section 5.28(b) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Sellers shall give Buyer written notice of any
Total Condemnation Action as promptly as practicable.

Section 5.29 Minimum Cash. At the Closing, Sellers shall cause the Acquired
Entities (i) to have an amount of Cash Amount equal to forty-two (42)
multiplied by the daily average Cash Amounts held by the Business (calculated

(12) weeks ended on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Closing Date),
or as otherwise mutually agreed in writing by Buyer and Sellers and (ii) to
have an amount of petty cash at the Retail Sites as required to operate the

commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith mutually agreeable
arrangements pursuant to the terms set forth on Section 5.30(e) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

the Signing Date, Sellers shall provide a true, correct and complete list of
all Real Property Leases with a remaining term, measures as of the Signing
Date, of fewer than seven (7) years and which contain no renewal options at
the discretion of an Acquired Entity, any Seller or Seller Parent. Seller
shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities to, in the Ordinary Course of
Business, use commercially reasonable efforts to extend all Near Term Real
Property Leases (other than those leases that Buyer elects to exempt from this
covenant) on customary market terms and consistent with prior ordinary course
practice; provided, that any extension of any Near Term Real Property Lease
with a rent increase of more than ten percent (10%) in any five (5) year

ARTICLE VII 

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing Date as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Sellers;

(b) by the written notice of either party to the other party if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before May 2, 2021 (the "Outside Date");
provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b)
shall (i) not be available to any party if the failure of such party to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or
shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to
such date and (ii) shall be subject to Section 9.10; provided, further, that
the Outside Date may be extended twice by a three (3) month period (but for a
period of no more than six (6) months in the aggregate) by either party upon
written notice to the other party if, as of the Outside Date, all conditions
to Closing set forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 have been
satisfied or waived by the applicable party in writing (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but which
are capable of being satisfied) other than the condition set forth in Section
6.1(a);

(c) by Sellers or by Buyer, upon written notice to the other, if any court of
competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental Entity shall have
issued a statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or injunction or taken any
other action permanently restraining, 

enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such statute, rule, regulation, order, decree or injunction or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable, unless in the case of
Buyer the failure to consummate the Closing because of such action by a
Governmental Entity shall be due to the failure of Buyer to have fulfilled any
of its obligations under this Agreement; provided that the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall have used
reasonable best efforts to remove or challenge such statute, rule, regulation,
order, decree or injunction;

(d) by Buyer upon written notice to Sellers, if there shall have been a
material breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants set forth in this Agreement on the part of any Seller or Seller
Parent which has rendered the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in
Section 6.2 incapable of fulfillment, such violation or breach has not been
waived by Buyer, and the breach is not capable of being cured prior to the
Outside Date or is not cured by the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following
Buyer's written notice to Sellers of such breach and (ii) the last Business
Day prior to the Outside Date; provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to Buyer if it is
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein; and

(e) by Sellers upon written notice to Buyer, if there shall have been a
material breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants set forth in this Agreement on the part of Buyer which has rendered

fulfillment, such violation or breach has not been waived by Sellers, and the
breach is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or is not cured
by the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following Sellers' written notice to
Buyer of such breach and (ii) the last Business Day prior to the Outside Date;
provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e)
shall not be available to Sellers if it is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained herein;

(f) by Sellers if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.2 have been satisfied or waived by Buyer in writing (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
which are capable of being satisfied), (ii) Sellers have confirmed in writing
at least three (3) Business Days prior to such termination that Sellers stand
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing, and (iii) Buyer has failed
to consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days of receipt by Buyer
of the written confirmation referred to in clause (ii) of this sentence.

Section 7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by a party hereto pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof, written notice
thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other parties
hereto, and this Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void and have
no effect, without any Liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto
or their respective directors, officers, employees, owners, Representatives or
Affiliates, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned
without further action by the parties hereto, except that the provisions of
Section 5.4, this Section 7.2, Section 9.1, Section 9.2, Section 9.4, Section
9.5, Section 9.6, Section 9.7, Section 9.9, Section 9.11 and Section 9.18
shall survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that if
such termination shall result from the willful and material breach by a party
of any of its representations, warranties, 

covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, Sellers or Buyer, as the
case may be, shall be fully liable for any and all Losses of the other parties
as a result of such breach, failure or termination. For purposes of this
ARTICLE VII, the term "willful and material breach" shall mean a material
breach of, or material failure to perform any of the covenants or other
agreements contained in, this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or
failure to act by the breaching or non-performing party with actual knowledge
that such party's act or failure to act would, or would be reasonably expected
to, result in or constitute a breach of or failure of performance under this
Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII 

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1 Survival.

(a) The representations and warranties of Sellers and Seller Parent contained
in this Agreement and in any certificate or instrument (other than the
Ancillary Agreements) delivered by or on behalf of any Seller or Seller Parent
pursuant to this Agreement (the "Seller Surviving Representations") shall
survive the Closing until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date
(the "Cutoff Date"); provided, however, that (i) the representations and
warranties of Sellers and Seller Parent in Section 3.12(b) (No Undisclosed
Liabilities) shall survive the Closing indefinitely, (ii) the representations
and warranties of Sellers and Seller Parent in Section 3.1 (Due Organization
and Good Standing), Section 3.2 (Authorization of Transaction), Section 3.3(a)
and (b) (Capital Structure; Subsidiaries) and Section 3.25 (Brokers' Fees)
shall survive the Closing until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, (iii) the representations and warranties of Sellers and Seller Parent in
Section 3.16 (Taxes), Section 3.21 (Employee Benefit Plans) (to the extent
they relate to Taxes), Section 3.21(f) (Employee Benefit Plans) and Section
3.31 (Unclaimed Property) of this Agreement shall survive the Closing until
sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations.

(b) The representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement
shall not survive the Closing.

(c) Other than with respect to the covenants and agreements in Section 5.27
and Section 5.31, the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
that require performance in full prior to the Closing (and any rights arising
out of any breach of such covenants and agreements), in each case, shall
survive the Closing until the Cutoff Date, and the covenants and agreements in
this Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be performed, in whole or
in part, after the Closing (and any rights arising out of any breach of such
covenants and agreements), in each case, shall survive the Closing for the
period provided in such covenants and agreements, if any, or until fully
performed. The covenants and agreements in Section 5.27 and Section 5.31 shall
not survive the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, except in the case of
indemnification for Taxes, indemnification for which is governed exclusively
by Section 5.16, the obligation of Sellers to retain, and indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties for, any Retained Liabilities, and the
obligation of Buyer to assume, and indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties for, any Assumed Liabilities, as well 

as any covenants and agreements of the parties that by their terms provide for
indemnification or reimbursement or allocate fees, payments, costs or expenses
as between the parties, shall survive the Closing indefinitely. No Person
shall be entitled to indemnification, and no Action seeking to recover Losses
or other relief shall be commenced or maintained, after the end of the
relevant survival period set forth herein, unless a claim for indemnification
with respect to such claim has previously been made prior to the end of the
relevant survival period in accordance with this Agreement.

Section 8.2 Obligations of Sellers. Subject to the terms of this ARTICLE VIII
and Section 8.1, effective as of and after the Closing, Sellers and Seller
Parent shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Buyer, its Affiliates and its and their respective successors, assigns,
directors, managers, officers, employees, shareholders, agents and controlling
persons (collectively, "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against, without
duplication, direct and indirect damages, Liabilities, claims, costs and
expenses, penalties, judgments and settlements (collectively, "Losses") that
any Buyer Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain or incur, or become subject to
(other than with respect to Taxes, indemnification for which is governed
exclusively by Section 5.16(h)), to the extent resulting from, arising out of
or in connection with: (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any of the Seller
Surviving Representations, (b) any breach of, or default in the performance
of, any covenant or agreement of Seller Parent or any Seller in this
Agreement; and (c) any Retained Liabilities.

Section 8.3 Obligations of Buyer. Subject to the terms of this ARTICLE VIII
and Section 8.1, effective as of and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Seller, Seller Parent, its respective Affiliates
and its and their respective successors, assigns, directors, managers,
officers, employees, shareholders, agents and controlling persons
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against direct or
indirect Losses that any Seller Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain or
incur, or become subject to (other than any Taxes, indemnification for which
is governed exclusively by Section 5.16), to the extent resulting from or
arising out of: (a) any breach of, or default in the performance of, any
covenant or agreement of Buyer in this Agreement; (b) any Assumed Liabilities;
and (c) a Third Party Claim brought after the Closing Date involving any
Seller Indemnified Party to the extent such Third Party Claim results from or
arises out of both (i) Buyer's ownership or operation of the Business
following the Closing and (ii) any Seller Indemnified Party was named in such
Third Party Claim solely because of such Seller Indemnified Party's capacity
as a direct or indirect owner, operator, employee, director or officer of the
Business prior to the Closing; provided that without limiting Section 8.3(a),
Sections 8.3(b) and (c) shall not entitle any Seller Indemnified Party to
indemnification with respect to, any matter for which a Buyer Indemnified
Party would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified by Seller Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries under Section 5.16 or Section 8.2 of this Agreement (ignoring
any survival periods, monetary or other limitations or procedures set forth in
this Agreement).

Section 8.4 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) If any of the Persons to be indemnified under this ARTICLE VIII (an
"Indemnified Party") has suffered or incurred any Loss, the Indemnified Party
shall so notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (such 

party from whom indemnification is sought, the "Indemnifying Party") promptly
in writing describing the event giving rise to such Loss, the basis upon which
indemnification is being sought, the amount or estimated amount of the Loss
(if known or reasonably capable of estimation), and the method of computation
of such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to
the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Loss shall have
occurred.

(b) In the event that any claim is brought by a third party for which an
Indemnifying Party may be liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or any
Action is commenced by a third party involving such claim (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of such Third Party Claim (the "Claim Notice"); provided that no delay
on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any such Claim Notice shall
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder
unless the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such delay. Any such
Claim Notice shall describe, with reasonable particularity, (i) the event
giving rise to such Third Party Claim, (ii) the basis upon which
indemnification is being sought and (iii) the amount or estimated amount of
Loss arising or expected to arise from such claim (if known or reasonably
capable of estimation). The Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20) days
from its receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the
Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires, by counsel of
its own choosing, to defend against such Third Party Claim; provided that the
Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume the defense and shall, subject to
the Indemnifying Party being obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party
under this ARTICLE VIII, pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party if any of (A) the claim for indemnification
is with respect to a criminal Action, (B) the claim seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief on the Indemnified Party, (C) the Indemnifying Party
does not, on or before the forty-fifth (45th) day after receipt of the Claim
Notice, agree in writing that it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified
Party against the amount of any Losses resulting therefrom, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.5, with respect to such Third Party Claim,
(D) if the assumption of such defense would cause Buyer to lose coverage under
or be in excess of the coverage provided by any environmental insurance policy
or the RandW Insurance Policy or Buyer or any insurer is required to assume such
defense under the terms thereunder, (E) the Third-Party Claim by a top thirty
(30) customer or supplier of the Business measured by (x) with respect to
customers, the total amount paid by such customer during the twelve (12)-month
period immediately preceding the date of such Claim Notice and (y) with
respect to suppliers, the total amount invoiced to the Business during the
twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding the date of such Claim Notice,
(F) the amount in dispute, when taken together with all other outstanding
claims for indemnification by the Indemnified Party, would reasonably be
expected to exceed twice the maximum amount for which the Indemnifying Party
can then be liable pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII in light of the limitations
set forth in this ARTICLE VIII or (G) the Indemnifying Party, after electing
to assume the defense, fails to use its reasonable best efforts to defend and
protect the interests of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim (provided that this Section 8.4(b)(G) shall not be available to
any Indemnified Party if such Indemnified Party is then in material breach of
its obligations under this ARTICLE VIII with respect to such Third Party
Claim). If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend against such Third
Party Claim: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to defend 

and protect the interests of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim; and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to any settlement which (w)
does not consist solely of money damages to be fully paid by the Indemnifying
Party, (x) does not contain an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party
from the subject matter of the settlement, (y) imposes an injunction or other
equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or (z) would not result in the
statement of liability, wrongdoing, criminal offense or finding or admission
of any violation of Law by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
undertakes to defend against such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the
investigation, defense and settlement thereof; provided, however, that such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with
separate counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnifying Party at the expense of
Indemnifying Party if in the reasonable opinion of both counsel to the
Indemnified Party and counsel to the Indemnifying Party (or, if they disagree,
of an independent counsel acceptable to each of them) a conflict or potential
conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that
would make such separate representation necessary; provided, further, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel
(plus any appropriate local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection
with any single Third Party Claim or a series of related Third Party Claims.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not undertake within the Notice Period to
assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
nevertheless have the right to participate in any such defense at its sole
cost and expense, but, in such case, the Indemnified Party shall control the
investigation and defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party agree to make available to each other, their respective
counsel and other Representatives, all information and documents (at no cost
to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of
the Indemnified Party)) that (i) are available to such party and (ii)
reasonably related to any indemnification claim brought under this ARTICLE
VIII. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and their respective
employees also agree to render to each other such assistance and cooperation
as may reasonably be required to ensure the proper and adequate defense of
such claim or demand. If (A) the Indemnifying Party is not permitted to assume
the defense pursuant to Section 8.4(b)(A), (B) or (C), (B) the proposed
settlement amount exceeds 300% of the maximum amount for which the
Indemnifying Party would then be liable with respect to such proposed
settlement amount pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII in light of the limitations
set forth in this ARTICLE VIII or (C) the Indemnifying Party withdraws from
the defense of a Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party assumes the
defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to settle, adjust or
compromise or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment in respect
of any Third Party Claim without the prior written approval of the
Indemnifying Party. In all other situations, the Indemnified Party shall not
be permitted to settle, adjust or compromise or permit a default or consent to
entry of any judgment in respect of any Third Party Claim without the prior
written approval of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Section 8.5 Limitations on Liability.

(a) The obligations of Sellers, Seller Parent and Buyer pursuant to Section
5.16 and Section 8.2 shall be subject to the following limitations: 

(i) Except for Losses as a result of, arising out of or in connection with (A)
Fraud or (B) the representations and warranties of Sellers in Section 3.1 (Due
Organization and Good Standing), Section 3.2 (Authorization of Transaction),
Section 3.3(a) and (b) (Capital Structure; Subsidiaries), Section 3.12(b) (No
Undisclosed Liabilities), Section 3.16 (Taxes), Section 3.21 (Employee Benefit
Plans) (to the extent they relate to Taxes), Section 3.21(f) (Employee Benefit
Plans), Section 3.25 (Brokers' Fees) and Section 3.31 (Unclaimed Property), no
Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover Losses in respect of any
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) until the aggregate
amount of Losses recoverable under Section 8.2(a) equals or exceeds an amount
equal to $42,000,000 (the "Threshold"), after which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may recover only the amount of Losses recoverable under Section 8.2(a)
in excess of the Threshold;

(ii) Except for Losses as a result of, arising out of or in connection with
(A) Fraud or (B) the representations and warranties of Sellers set forth in
Section 3.1 (Due Organization and Good Standing), Section 3.2 (Authorization
of Transaction), Section 3.3(a) and (b) (Capital Structure; Subsidiaries),
Section 3.12(b) (No Undisclosed Liabilities), Section 3.16 (Taxes), Section
3.21 (Employee Benefit Plans) (to the extent they relate to Taxes), Section
3.21(f) (Employee Benefit Plans), Section 3.25 (Brokers' Fees) and Section
3.31 (Unclaimed Property), the indemnification obligation of Sellers under
Section 8.2(a) shall not exceed an amount equal to $84,000,000 (the "Cap");
and

(iii) Except for Losses as a result of, arising out of or in connection with
Fraud or Section 3.12(b) (No Undisclosed Liabilities), the indemnification
obligations of Sellers under Section 5.16, Section 8.2(a) and Section 8.2(b)
in the aggregate shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the Final
Purchase Price.

(b) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount of any
indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss
for which an indemnification claim has been made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement other than with respect to
any payments under the RandW Insurance Policy, to avoid double recovery by an
Indemnified Party, and shall be computed net of: (i) payments actually
received by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect to
such Losses (net of any collection costs and any increase in premium resulting
from the coverage for such Loss) (it being agreed that if third-party
insurance or indemnification, contribution or similar proceeds in respect of
such facts are recovered by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates subsequent
to the Indemnifying Party's making of an indemnification payment in
satisfaction of its applicable indemnification obligation, such proceeds, net
of any collection costs, shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party
to the extent of the indemnification payment made); and (ii) any prior or
subsequent recovery actually received by the Indemnified Party from any Person
with respect to such Losses (including pursuant to any indemnification
agreement or arrangement with any third party) (it being agreed that if such
recovery is received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates subsequent to
the Indemnifying Party's making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction
of its applicable indemnification obligation, such proceeds, net of any
collection costs, shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party to the
extent of the indemnification payment made). 

(c) In respect of any Loss for which indemnification may be sought pursuant to
Section 5.16 or this ARTICLE VIII, the Indemnified Party shall (and shall
cause its Affiliates to) (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
any Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected
to, or does, give rise thereto, including making an insurance claim, but such
commercially reasonable efforts shall not require the Indemnified Party to
initiate any Action or expend any funds (other than de minimis amounts) in
order to comply with this Section 8.5(c); provided, however, that except for
Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 5.16 as a result
of, arising out of or in connection with Fraud, Buyer shall first seek
recourse from the RandW Insurance Policy with respect thereto; provided that if
(x) the RandW Insurance Policy is not in full force and effect at Closing and
(y) Sellers nevertheless pay to Buyer at Closing an amount equal to all of the
underwriting costs, deposit, premium and taxes payable with respect to the RandW
Insurance Policy if the RandW Insurance Policy in the form as of the Signing
Date were fully bound and effective as of the Closing Date, then the RandW
Insurance Policy shall be deemed to provide coverage of up to one billion and
three hundred sixteen million dollars and no cents ($1,316,000,000) for the
purposes of Section 5.16 and this ARTICLE VIII to ensure that in no event
shall Seller Parent or any Seller be liable under this Agreement for any
liabilities or obligations in excess of such liabilities or obligations as
they would have been under this Agreement if the RandW Insurance Policy in the
form as of the Signing Date had been in full force and effect since the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to make any payment to an Indemnified
Party in respect of such Loss to the extent such Indemnified Party has failed
to comply with its obligations under this Section 8.5(c).

(d) The parties agree that except for (A) the indemnities provided for in
Section 5.20, (B) any remedy for Losses that Indemnified Parties may have to
the extent arising out of Fraud, (C) any claims seeking an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief, from and after the Closing,
pursuant to Section 9.10, (D) with respect to the matters covered by Section
2.4 and (E) any remedy for Losses that are provided pursuant to any Ancillary
Agreement (which shall be governed exclusively by such Ancillary Agreement)
the remedies provided in Section 5.16 or this ARTICLE VIII shall be deemed the
sole and exclusive remedies of the parties, from and after the Closing Date,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
each Indemnified Party expressly waives and relinquishes, on behalf of itself,
its successors and any assigns, any and all rights, claims or remedies such
Person may have other than under Section 5.16 or this ARTICLE VIII against any
Indemnifying Party or any Affiliate thereof (and any of their respective
Representatives) arising under or based upon this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, any statutory, equitable, or common law
rights or remedies relating to any environmental matters; provided that
nothing herein shall prevent any Buyer Indemnified Party from seeking
recovery, or recovering, against the RandW Insurance Policy in accordance with
its terms. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall
any party, its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek
rescission of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement after Closing.

(e) In order to avoid double recovery by any Indemnified Party, the amount of
any Losses or Taxes to which an Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified with respect to any claim shall be calculated without duplication
related to any Loss or Tax to the extent of any adjustment to the Initial
Purchase Price made pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof for any accruals, reserves
or provisions therefor reflected or included in the Final Net Working Capital,
the Final 

Closing Adjustment or the Financial Statements, in each case with respect to
such Loss or Tax. After the Closing, there shall be no recovery under this
ARTICLE VIII for a breach or alleged breach of Section 5.22 (other than
Section 5.22(c)).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ARTICLE VIII, "Losses"
shall not include Liability for punitive damages of any kind or nature,
regardless of the form of action through which damages are sought, except to
the extent actually awarded by a Governmental Entity against, or paid by, an
Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third Party Claim.

Section 8.6 Materiality. The right to indemnification or any other remedy
based on the representations and warranties made in or pursuant to this
Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered (other than any
Ancillary Agreement) by or on behalf of a Party pursuant to this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted at any time, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the Closing, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or
compliance with, any such representation or warranty or by reason of the
Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition set forth in Section 6.1 or
Section 6.2. For purposes of determining (i) whether any representation or
warranty is inaccurate or has been breached and (ii) the amount of Loss
resulting from any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty,
calculating Losses under this ARTICLE VIII (but excluding the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.11 (Reports), Section 3.17(a) (Absence
of Certain Changes) and the usage of the word "Material" in the defined term
"Material Contract"), each such representation and warranty and any
constituent definition shall be read without regard and without giving effect
to the terms "material," "Material Adverse Effect," "material adverse effect,"
"material to the Business," or other variations of the words "material,"
"material adverse effect" or "material to the Business" contained in such
representation or warranty (as if such words, phrases and related clauses were
deleted from such representation and warranty and, in the case of "Material
Adverse Effect" or "material adverse effect," as if such words read as
"adverse effect").

Section 8.7 RandW Insurance Policy and Environmental Insurance Policy. Sellers
and Seller Parent acknowledge that, in connection with the RandW Insurance
Policy and the Environmental Insurance Policy, a Buyer Indemnified Party may
make claims for the same Loss or series of related Losses under both this
ARTICLE VIII (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.5), and under
the RandW Insurance Policy and Environmental Insurance Policy, but in no event
shall any Buyer Indemnified Party be entitled under this ARTICLE VIII to
recover more than the actual Losses incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Party.

ARTICLE IX 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1 Choice of Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement, and all claims,
disputes, controversies or causes of action (whether in contract, tort, equity
or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement
(including any schedule or exhibit hereto) or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim, dispute, controversy or
cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to
enter into this 

Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties agrees that any Action brought against any Debt
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Debt Financing,
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
New York without regard to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New
York. Each of the parties agrees that any Action related to this agreement
shall be brought exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in any of the federal or state courts located in the state
of Delaware) (the "Chosen Courts"). By executing and delivering this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto irrevocably: (a) accepts generally and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for
any Action relating to this Agreement, including for any Action arising from
any Dispute and any Action brought for any remedy contemplated by Section
9.10; (b) waives any objections which such party may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any such Action contemplated by this Section 9.1 and
hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any
such Action has been brought in an inconvenient forum; (c) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat the personal jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts
by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d) agrees that it
will not bring any Action contemplated by this Section 9.1 in any court other
than the Chosen Courts; (e) agrees that service of all process, including the
summons and complaint, in any Action may be made in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.2 or in any other manner permitted by Law; and (f)
agrees that service as provided in the preceding clause (e) is sufficient to
confer personal jurisdiction over such party in the Action, and otherwise
constitutes effective and binding service in every respect. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each party hereto agrees that it
will not bring or support any Action against any Debt Financing Source in any
way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any forum other than the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in New York
County (and appellate courts thereof), and each party makes the agreements,
waivers and consents set forth in this Section 9.1 mutatis mutandis but with
respect to the courts specified in this sentence.

Section 9.2 Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be given or made (and shall

given by another method specified in this Section 9.2), when sent by overnight

Section 9.3 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not be considered in interpreting or construing
any of the provisions contained in this Agreement.

Section 9.4 Fees and Expenses.

(a) Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each party hereto shall
bear its own costs and expenses (including investment advisory, accountant and
legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, 

whether or not the Closing shall have occurred or this Agreement is
terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all unpaid costs and expenses
(including investment advisory, accountant and legal fees and expenses, but
excluding Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is responsible pursuant to Section
5.7(a)(y)(3)) incurred prior to the Closing by the Acquired Companies and the
Acquired Entities in connection with this Agreement, the Separation Plan and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be borne by Sellers.

(b) No later than forty-five (45) days immediately following the Closing,
Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a schedule (the "Expenses
Schedule") detailing the Covered Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date
and the resulting Excess Covered Transaction Expenses, if any, together with
all supporting documentation and invoices sufficient to substantiate such
Covered Transaction Expenses and any other documentation or information Buyer
reasonably request for the purposes of calculating the Excess Covered
Transaction Expenses, if any; provided, however, that if Sellers' estimate of
Excess Covered Transaction Expenses is zero dollars ($0.00), then Sellers
shall only be required to notify Buyer that the Excess Covered Transaction
Expenses is zero and shall not be required to deliver the Expenses Schedule or
any supporting or invoices documentation, and Buyer shall not be required to
make any payment to Sellers in respect thereof. If Sellers' estimate of Excess
Covered Transaction Expenses is greater than zero ($0.00), Buyer shall have
thirty (30) days following the receipt of the Expenses Schedule, supporting
documentation and invoices and any other information reasonably requested by
Buyer to review such information, and, at any time on or prior to the
expiration of such period, Buyer may notify Sellers in writing that Buyer
disputes all or any portion of the amounts set forth in the Expenses Schedule.
Buyer and Sellers shall work in good faith to resolve such disputed items and,
if Buyer and Sellers so resolve all such disputed items, the Excess Covered
Transaction Expenses, if any, as amended to the extent necessary to reflect
the agreed resolution of such disputed items, shall be final and binding on
the parties. Notwithstanding their good faith efforts, if Buyer and Sellers do
not reach agreement resolving any disputed items within thirty (30) days
following receipt by Sellers of Buyer's dispute notice, Buyer and Sellers
shall submit such disputed items to the Independent Accounting Firm, who shall
within twenty (20) days following its engagement, deliver to Buyer and Sellers
its resolution of the disputed items and the resulting calculation of Excess
Covered Transaction Expenses, if any, which, absent Fraud or manifest error,
shall be binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers. If the Excess
Covered Transaction Expenses, as finally determined pursuant to this Section
9.4(b) are greater than zero ($0.00), then Buyer shall pay to Sellers the
amount of such Excess Covered Transaction Expenses by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within ten (10) days following such final
determination.

Section 9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the exhibits and
schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, undertakings and
understandings, whether written or oral, between or on behalf of the parties
hereto with respect to such subject matter; provided, however, for the sake of
clarity, subject to Section 5.4(a) it is understood that this Agreement shall
not supersede the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement (to
the extent inconsistent with the terms and provisions hereof), which shall
survive and remain in effect until expiration or termination thereof in
accordance with its respective terms. 

Section 9.6 Interpretation.

(a) When a reference is made to an Article, Section, Exhibit, Buyer Disclosure
Schedule or Seller Disclosure Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article,
Section, Exhibit, Buyer Disclosure Schedule or Seller Disclosure Schedule of
or to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

(b) Whenever the words "include," "includes," "including" and words of similar
import are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation," unless otherwise specified.

(c) The word "or" shall not be exclusive.

(d) Unless the context requires otherwise, words using the singular or plural
number also include the plural or singular number, respectively, and the use
of any gender herein shall be deemed to include the other genders.

(e) References to "dollars" or "$" are to U.S. dollars.

(f) Any reference to "days" means calendar days unless Business Days are
expressly specified.

(g) When calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded and if the last day of such period is not a Business Day,
the period shall end on the next succeeding Business Day.

(h) The terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereto" and derivative or similar
words refer to this entire Agreement and the words "date hereof" refer to the
Signing Date.

(i) Any Law defined or referred to in this Agreement or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by
succession of comparable successor Laws and the related regulations thereunder
and published interpretations thereof, and references to any Contract or
instrument are to that Contract or instrument as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented; provided that, for purposes of any representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date
or dates, references to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law, as
amended, and the related regulations thereunder and published interpretations
thereof, in each case, as of such date.

(j) It is understood and agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in
the representations and warranties or covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower
amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not material.

(k) Nothing herein (including the Seller Disclosure Schedule) shall be deemed
an admission by either party or any of its Affiliates, in any Action, that
such party or any such 

Affiliate, or any third party, is or is not in breach or violation of, or in
default in, the performance or observance of any term or provisions of any
Contract or any Law.

(l) This Agreement was prepared jointly by the parties hereto and no rule that
it be construed against the drafter will have any application in its
construction or interpretation.

(m) Any language from prior drafts of this Agreement, to the extent not
included in the definitive version of this Agreement executed by each of the
parties hereto, shall not be deemed to reflect the intention of any party
hereto, or otherwise serve as parol evidence of any kind, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 9.7 Disclosure. Any matter disclosed in any Section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule shall be considered disclosed with respect to each other
Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to the extent the relevance thereto
is readily apparent on its face. The inclusion of information in any Section
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that
such information is material or that such matter actually constitutes
noncompliance with, or a violation of, any Law, Permit or Contract or other
topic to which such disclosure is applicable.

Section 9.8 Waiver and Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by a written mutual agreement executed and delivered by both
Sellers and Buyer. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure
of any party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a
written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver
or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligations, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
amendment, modification or waiver of this Section 9.8, Section 9.1, Section
9.9, Section 9.10, Section 9.11 and Section 9.18 (or any other provision of
this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification or waiver of such
provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) that
is adverse to the interests of any Debt Financing Source will be effective
against such Debt Financing Source without the prior written consent of such
adversely affected Debt Financing Source.

Section 9.9 No Third-party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Persons specifically named in the preamble to this Agreement as
parties hereto and their respective successors or permitted assigns and,
except for (i) Section 5.17 and paragraph (a) of Section 5.21 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and as provided in ARTICLE VIII and (ii) this Section 9.9,
Section 9.1, Section 9.8, Section 9.10, Section 9.11 and Section 9.18 (or any
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, waiver, modification
or supplement of such provision would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) which are intended to benefit, and be enforceable by,
the Debt Financing Sources (to the extent contemplated thereby), nothing
herein express or implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person,
other than the parties hereto and such permitted assigns, but including,
without limitation, any current or former manager, director, officer, employee
or independent contractor of either party hereto, any legal or equitable
rights hereunder. This Agreement may only be enforced against the named
parties hereto or their respective successors or permitted assigns. This
Agreement may only be enforced against the named parties hereto, and no
officer, director, 

owner, employee, Debt Financing Source or Affiliate of any party hereto
(including any Person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a
party hereto) shall have any liability or obligation with respect to this
Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action (whether in contract
or tort) that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including a
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement). For the avoidance of doubt, for
the purposes of this Section 9.9, any party's status as a named party to this
Agreement shall control over such party's status as an Affiliate of any other
named party. None of the Debt Financing Sources will have any liability to the
Sellers or their Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, and neither the Sellers nor any of the their Affiliates will have
any rights or claims against any of the Debt Financing Sources hereunder or
thereunder.

Section 9.10 Specific Performance.

(a) The parties agree and acknowledge that the failure to perform under this
Agreement will cause an actual, immediate and irreparable harm and injury and
that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached prior to the Closing.
Accordingly, it is agreed that, except where this Agreement is properly
terminated in accordance with ARTICLE VII (i) each of the parties hereto shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other party prior to the Closing and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement and any other
agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith and (ii) damages shall
be awarded only in a case where a court of competent jurisdiction shall have
determined that, notwithstanding the parties' intention for specific
performance to be the applicable remedy prior to termination or the Closing,
such specific performance is not available or otherwise will not be granted as
a remedy.

(b) The parties further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this Section 9.10, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement, including in the event that the remedies provided for in this
Section 9.10 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing
contained in this Section 9.10 shall require any party to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any party's right to institute any proceeding for)
specific performance under this Section 9.10 before exercising any termination
right under Section 7.1 (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor
shall the commencement of any Action pursuant to this Section 9.10 or anything
contained in this Section 9.10 restrict or limit any party's right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 7.1 or pursue
any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto agree that specific performance prior to the Closing under this Section
9.10 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Buyer with respect to
Section 5.27 and Section 5.31.

(d) To the extent either party hereto brings any Action to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
any other agreement or 

instrument executed in connection herewith in accordance with this Section
9.10, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of
time during which such Action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or
(ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
Action.

Section 9.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING IN
ANY COURT RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF,
RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO AND THERETO) OR THE DEBT FINANCING
(INCLUDING ANY SUCH ACTION AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE) OR
THE BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF SUCH AGREEMENTS OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF SUCH AGREEMENTS. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL
SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS. NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION
IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY
TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES
THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION
9.11. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY
THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 9.11 WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL
INSTANCES.

Section 9.12 Prevailing Party. If any Action is commenced by any party to
enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other party, all fees,
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs,
incurred by the prevailing party in such Action shall be reimbursed by the
losing party. As used in this Section 9.12, the term "prevailing party" shall
mean the party that has succeeded upon a significant issue in the Action and
achieved a material benefit with respect to the claims at issue, taken as a
whole.

Section 9.13 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such term or provision to any person or circumstance is
determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any
Law or as a matter of public policy, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof. Upon such
determination that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to give effect to the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by consummated as originally
contemplated, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 9.14 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed, shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one
and the same instrument binding upon all of the parties hereto notwithstanding
the fact that all parties are not signatory to the original or the same 

counterpart. For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile signatures shall be
deemed originals, and the parties agree to exchange original signatures as
promptly as possible.

Section 9.15 No Right of Setoff. No party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof may
deduct from, set off, holdback or otherwise reduce in any manner whatsoever
any amount owed to it hereunder or pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement against
any amounts owed hereunder or pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement by such
Persons to the other party hereto or any of such other party's Affiliates.

Section 9.16 Bulk Transfer Laws. Each party hereto herby waives compliance by
the other party with the provisions of the bulk transfer Laws of any
jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 9.17 Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Non-Assertion of
Attorney Client Privilege.

(a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including, following the Closing, the Acquired Entities and their
Subsidiaries, to waive and not assert, any conflict of interest arising out of
the legal representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing
Representation"), of any Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any shareholder,
officer, employee or director of any Seller or any of its Affiliates (any such
Person, a "Designated Person") in any dispute with Buyer or its Affiliates
involving this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, by any legal counsel currently
representing such Designated Person in connection with this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or any other agreements or transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz (any such
representation with respect to the foregoing scope of matters, the "Current
Representation").

(b) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates,
including, following the Closing, the Acquired Entities and their
Subsidiaries, to waive and not assert, any attorney-client privilege with
respect to any communication between any legal counsel and any Designated
Person occurring during the Current Representation (the "Privileged
Communications") or in connection with any Post-Closing Representation,
including in connection with a dispute with Buyer or its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, any Acquired Entity or any of its
Subsidiaries), including in respect of any claim for indemnification by a
Buyer Indemnified Party, it being the intention of the parties that all such
rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client
privilege shall be retained by Sellers or their respective Affiliate and that
Sellers shall have the sole right to decide whether or not to waive any such
attorney-client privilege. Accordingly, from and after Closing, none of Buyer
or its Affiliates, including the Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries,
shall have any access to any such communications or to the files of the
Current Representation, all of which shall be and remain the property of
Sellers or their Affiliate or to internal counsel relating to such engagement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (x) a dispute arises between
Buyer or its Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Acquired
Entities and their Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party other 

than Sellers or their Affiliates, on the other hand, Buyer or its Affiliates,
including, following the Closing, or (y) to the extent that any such attorney-
client privilege or Privileged Communication is required to be waived or
otherwise required to be similarly released by any Governmental Entity, the
Acquired Entities and their Subsidiaries shall control the attorney-client
privilege and the Privileged Communications.

Section 9.18 Assignment; Binding Effect. This Agreement and the rights
hereunder are not assignable by either party hereto unless such assignment is
consented to in writing by both Buyer and Sellers and, subject to the
preceding clause, this Agreement and all the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; provided that (a) Buyer may
assign any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more of
its Affiliates (without relieving Buyer of its obligations hereunder) and (b)
each Seller may assign any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder to
one or more of its Affiliates (without relieving such Seller of its
obligations hereunder). Any attempted assignment of this Agreement not in
accordance with the terms of this Section 9.18 shall be void. This Agreement
may be amended or modified only by a written agreement executed and delivered
by duly authorized officers of Buyer, Seller Parent and Sellers. This
Agreement may not be modified or amended except as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence and any amendment by any party or parties hereto effected
in a manner which does not comply with this Section 9.18 shall be void.

Section 9.19 No Other Representations.

(a) Except as expressly and specifically covered by a representation and
warranty set forth in ARTICLE III or any Ancillary Agreement or any other
agreement, document or instrument to be delivered in connection herewith or
therewith, none of Sellers, Seller Parent, the Acquired Entities or their
respective Affiliates nor any other Person has made any other express or
implied representation or warranty, whether written or oral, to Buyer. Except
as expressly and specifically covered by a representation and warranty set
forth in ARTICLE III or any Ancillary Agreement, none of Sellers, Seller
Parent, the Acquired Entities or their respective Affiliates nor any other
Person has made a representation or warranty to Buyer regarding the accuracy
or completeness of, or otherwise with respect to, (i) any projections,
forecasts, plans, estimates or budgets for the Business or (ii) any material,
documents or information relating to Sellers, Seller Parent or the Acquired
Entities made available to Buyer or its Representatives in any "data room",
offering memorandum, information memorandum or otherwise.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, neither Sellers nor Seller Parent makes any
representation or warranty with respect to, and nothing contained in this
Agreement (including ARTICLE III hereof), in the Ancillary Agreements or in
any other agreement, document or instrument to be delivered in connection
herewith or therewith is intended or shall be construed to be a representation
or warranty (express or implied) of Sellers or Seller Parent, for any purpose
of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other agreement, document
or instrument to be delivered in connection herewith or therewith, in respect
of any financial reports, statements and data delivered or made available to
Buyer between the date hereof and the Closing Date.
