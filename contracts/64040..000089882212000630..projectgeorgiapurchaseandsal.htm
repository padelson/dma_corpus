on behalf of and in its capacity as agent for each Seller, by wire transfer,
to an account or accounts designated by Parent (or by such Affiliate) prior to
the Closing, in immediately available funds, an aggregate amount equal (1) to
the Pre-Adjustment Amount, _plus_ (2) the Closing Adjustment (if the Closing
Adjustment is a positive amount) _less_ (3) the absolute value of the Closing
Adjustment (if the Closing Adjustment is a negative amount) _less_ (4) the
Holdback Amount;

  

##### (B) deliver to Parent the certificate required to be

## _2.4_ _Closing Adjustment_.

  

### (a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall provide Purchaser with a statement (the
" _Closing Notice_ ") of (x) the estimated Adjustment Amount (the " _Closing
Adjustment_ "), (y) Parent's calculation of the Closing Adjustment in
reasonable detail and the Cash Consideration (together with supporting
documentation for such estimates and any additional information reasonably
requested by Purchaser) after giving effect to the Closing Adjustment and (z)
the account or accounts to which Purchaser shall transfer funds pursuant to
_Section 2.3_; _provided_ that if Purchaser provides Parent with less than
seven (7) Business Days' notice of Closing, Parent will provide the Closing
Notice within a reasonable period thereafter.

  

### (b) The Closing Notice shall be prepared in accordance with
the accounting methods, principles and policies described in _Schedule III_
hereto and, to the extent not specified therein, GAAP (the " _Transaction
Accounting Principles_ "), and on a basis consistent with their application in
connection with the preparation of the Financial Statements.

  

## _2.5_ _Post-Closing Statements_.

  

### (a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement of the Adjustment
Amount (the " _Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement_ "), setting forth
Purchaser's calculation of the Adjustment Amount in reasonable detail. The
Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in accordance with
the Transaction Accounting Principles applied consistently with their
application in connection with the preparation of the Financial Statements and
the Estimated Closing Working Capital.

  

### (b) During the forty (40)-day period immediately following
Parent's receipt of the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement (the "
_Review Period_ "), Parent, Sellers and their representatives will be
permitted to review Purchaser's books, records and work papers to the extent
relating to the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. Purchaser will,
and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its accountants to,
cooperate with and assist Parent and Sellers in the conduct of such review,
including by providing reasonable access to such books, records and work
papers and making available personnel to the extent reasonably required in
connection with such review.

  

### (c) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through
the date that the Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement becomes final and
binding, it will not take or permit to be taken any actions with respect to
any accounting books, records, policies or procedures on which the Financial
Statements or the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement is based, or on
which the Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement are to be based, that are
inconsistent with the Transaction Accounting Principles or that would or would
reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the determination of the
Adjustment Amount or the preparation of any Notice of Disagreement or the
Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement in the manner and utilizing the
methods provided by this Agreement.

  

## 

  

       

  

  



  

## _2.6_ _Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements_.

  

### (a) Parent shall notify Purchaser in writing prior to the
expiration of the Review Period if Parent believes the Initial Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement contains mathematical errors or was not prepared in
accordance with _Section 2.5(a)_, which notice shall describe with reasonable
specificity the basis for such belief (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). If
no Notice of Disagreement is received by Purchaser prior to the expiration of
the Review Period, then the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be
deemed to have been accepted by Parent and shall become final and binding upon
the Parties in accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_.

  

### (b) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the
delivery of a Notice of Disagreement (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Parent and
Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may
have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. All
such discussions related thereto shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence and any similar state rule shall not apply. Accordingly,
evidence of such discussions shall not be admissible or used by any Party in
any future proceedings between the Parties, including any proceedings before
or with the Independent Accounting Firm, except as otherwise provided in Rule
408.

  

### (c) If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Parent and
Purchaser have been unable to resolve any differences that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, Parent and
Purchaser shall submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the
Notice of Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement marked to indicate those line items that are not in
dispute) to Deloitte and Touche LLP or another independent certified public
accounting firm in the United States of good national reputation mutually
acceptable to Parent and Purchaser (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ").
Within thirty (30) days after the Independent Accounting Firm's selection, the
Independent Accounting Firm shall make a final written determination, binding
on the Parties to this Agreement, and upon which a judgment may be rendered by
a court having proper jurisdiction thereover, of the appropriate amount of
each of the line items in the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement which
remain in dispute as indicated in the Notice of Disagreement which Parent and
Purchaser have submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall calculate, based solely on the written submissions of
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, and not by
independent investigation (and acting as an expert in accounting), the
Adjustment Amount and shall be instructed that its calculation (i) must be
made in accordance with the standards and definitions in this Agreement
(including the Transaction Accounting Principles), and (ii) with respect to
each item in dispute, such determination shall not be in excess of the higher,
nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Parent in the Notice of
Disagreement or by Purchaser in the Initial Post-Closing Adjustment Statement
with respect to such disputed line item. The statement of the Adjustment
Amount that is final and binding on the Parties, as determined either through
agreement of the Parties pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_ or through
the action of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section
2.6(c)_, is referred to as the " _Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement_ ",
and the Adjustment Amount set forth therein as the " _Final Adjustment
Amount_."

  

### (d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to
be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Parent on
the one hand, and Purchaser on the

  

       

  

  

other hand, in proportion to the differences between the Working Capital
amount as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm and the Working
Capital amount set forth in the Notice of Disagreement and the Initial Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement, respectively. During the review by the
Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser, Parent and Sellers and their
respective accountants will each make available to the Independent Accounting
Firm interviews with such personnel, and such information, books and records
and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the Independent Accounting
Firm to fulfill its obligations under _Section 2.6(c)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the accountants of Parent or Purchaser shall not be obliged
to make any work papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm except in
accordance with such accountants' normal disclosure procedures and then only
after such firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to
work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.
In acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will be
entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

  

 _2.7_ _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The " _Post-Closing Adjustment_ " shall be equal to (i) the Final Adjustment Amount less (ii) the Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then Purchaser shall pay in cash to Parent (or one or more Affiliates designated by Parent), on behalf of and in its capacity as agent for Sellers, the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then Parent (or an Affiliate designated by Parent), on behalf of and in its capacity as agent for Sellers, shall pay in cash to Purchaser the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any such payment shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement is delivered, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the Closing Date until the date of payment. Subject to _Section 2.9(b)_, the Cash Consideration shall equal the Pre-Adjustment Amount, (x) _plus_ the Final Adjustment Amount, if the Final Adjustment Amount is positive, or (y) less the absolute value of the Final Adjustment Amount, if the Final Adjustment Amount is negative.  

  

 _2.8_ _Purchase Price Allocation_. Sellers and Purchaser agree to (and agree to cause their respective Affiliates to) allocate the Purchase Price and any assumed liabilities treated as amount realized, for Tax purposes, among the assets and shares deemed sold for U.S. federal income Tax purposes in accordance with _Schedule IV_ attached hereto (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Parent a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts) as of the Closing Date, which allocation shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation and be determined in a manner consistent with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Purchaser 's Allocation_"). If Parent disagrees with Purchaser's Allocation, Parent may, within sixty (60) days after delivery of Purchaser's Allocation, deliver a notice (the " _Parent 's Allocation Notice_") to Purchaser to such effect, specifying those items as to which Parent disagrees and setting forth Parent's proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts). If the Parent's Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Parent and Purchaser shall, during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts), which allocation shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation. If Parent and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining disputes. Any allocation of the 

  

## 

  

       

  

  



  

  Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts) determined pursuant to the
decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall incorporate, reflect and be
consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation. All fees and expenses relating
to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be borne equally by Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand. The allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts), as
prepared by Purchaser if no Parent's Allocation Notice has been given, as
adjusted pursuant to any agreement between Parent and Purchaser or as
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm (the " _Allocation_ ") shall be
conclusive and binding on all Parties. The Allocation shall be adjusted, as
necessary, to reflect any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.7_, _Section 2.9_ or _Section 7.10_. Any such
adjustment shall be allocated to the asset, assets, share or shares (if any)
to which such adjustment is attributable; _provided_ that to the extent there
are no such assets or shares, such adjustment shall be allocated _pro rata_
among the assets and shares deemed sold for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.
Sellers and Purchaser agree (and agree to cause their respective Affiliates)
to prepare and file all relevant federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to, IRS Forms 8883 and 8594) in accordance with
the Allocation. None of Sellers, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates shall take any position inconsistent with the Allocation on any Tax
Return or in any Tax Proceeding, in each case, except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code (or any similar provision of applicable state, local or foreign
Law).

  

## _2.9_ _Foreign Transfer and Acquisition Agreements; Deferred
Closings; Delayed Transfers_.

  

### (a) _Foreign Transfer and Acquisition Agreements_. The
transfer of each Foreign Transferred Company will be effected pursuant to an
individual short-form acquisition agreement (each a " _Foreign Transfer and
Acquisition Agreement_ ") on a country-by-country basis in substantially the
same form as the applicable Foreign Transfer and Acquisition Agreement
attached as _Exhibit G_ to this Agreement; _provided_ in each case that the
Foreign Transfer and Acquisition Agreements shall serve purely to effect the
legal transfer of the applicable Foreign Transferred Company and shall not
have any significant effect on the value being received by Purchaser or given
by Sellers, including the allocation of assets and Liabilities as between
them, all of which shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement.

  

### (b) _Deferred Closings_.

  

#### (i) If, as of the Closing, in any country other than a
Primary Jurisdiction (any such country, a " _Deferred Closing Jurisdiction_
"), (A) there is an applicable Law then in effect in the Deferred Closing
Jurisdiction or a Governmental Entity in the Deferred Closing Jurisdiction
shall have issued or entered an Order that is then in effect, either or both
of which has the effect of restraining, enjoining, or making illegal the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Sale or the transactions contemplated hereby with respect
to such jurisdiction or to occur outside of such jurisdiction, (B) any filing
with, notice to, or permit, authorization, registration, consent or approval
of a Governmental Entity in the Deferred Closing Jurisdiction that is required
to consummate the purchase by Purchaser of the Shares of a Transferred Company
(or the indirect purchase of a Subsidiary thereof) incorporated or

  

       

  

  

organized in the Deferred Closing Jurisdiction (the " _Deferred Closing
Governmental Approvals_ ") shall not have been obtained or (C) any consent
listed on _Section 2.9(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not have
been obtained with respect to the Transferred Company specified therein (the "
_Specified Deferred Business_ "), then the closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby (" _Deferred Closing_ ") with respect to such Transferred
Company (or Transferred Companies) (each, a " _Deferred Business_ ") shall be
deferred until the third (3rd) Business Day (a " _Deferred Closing Date_ ")
following the satisfaction or waiver (other than those conditions that by
their nature can only be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) of the conditions described in
_Section 8.4_ with respect to such Deferred Business. 

  



  

#### (ii) Until the Deferred Closing Outside Date, Parent,
Sellers and Purchaser shall, consistent with any contractual obligation or any
applicable legal or fiduciary obligation under applicable Law, use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which
Purchaser (or one or more of its Affiliates) would, in compliance with
applicable Law, obtain the benefits and assume the obligations and bear the
economic burdens associated with operating a Deferred Business for the period
between the Closing and the Deferred Closing with respect to such Deferred
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the earlier of the Deferred Closing Date and the
Deferred Closing Outside Date, except as Purchaser may consent in writing,
Parent shall conduct the operations of the Deferred Business in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice ( _provided_ that (x) Purchaser shall
promptly reimburse Parent for any amounts invested by any member of the Parent
Group in such Deferred Business in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice (" _Deferred Business Investments_ "), (y) Parent shall have no
obligation to and shall not make any Deferred Business Investments that,
individually, or in the aggregate, exceed $1,000,000 without the prior consent
of Purchaser and (z) Parent shall provide Purchaser with reasonable advance
notice of Parent's intent to make a Deferred Business Investment), and Parent
shall not, and shall not permit the Deferred Business to: (A) except in the
ordinary course of business, incur or assume any liabilities, obligations or
indebtedness for borrowed money; (B) make or pay any dividend or distribution,
whether of cash or other assets on a non _pro rata_ basis (such dividends or
distributions to be paid to Purchaser upon the applicable Deferred Closing
Date); or (C) sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of any asset of the
Deferred Business to any Person except for sales of inventory or product in
the ordinary course of business.

  

#### (iii) At each Deferred Closing, if any, Purchaser and Parent
shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow Account to Parent (or
to a designee of Parent), on behalf of and in its capacity as agent for each
Seller, by wire transfer to an account or accounts designated by Parent (or by
such designee), an amount equal to the Deferred Purchase Price in respect of
such Deferred Business (as set forth in _Schedule IV_ hereto, as such
Schedule IV may be updated by mutual agreement of the Parties hereto prior to
the Closing Date). As promptly as practicable following the first anniversary
of the date of this Agreement (as may be extended pursuant to the following
proviso, the " _Deferred Closing Outside Date_ "), Purchaser and Parent shall
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to release any remaining Holdback Amount then held in the
Escrow Account (or right or claim thereto) to Purchaser, and the Cash
Consideration and the

  

       

  

  

Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward to reflect any such relinquishment
to Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ that as long as Sellers are using their
reasonable efforts to secure all requisite approvals, such Deferred Closing
Outside Date shall be extended to the earlier of (A) the third (3rd) Business
Day after the date on which all approvals from a Governmental Entity required
to complete the applicable Deferred Closings are received and (B) the third
(3rd) anniversary of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

#### (iv) At each Deferred Closing, if any, (A) Purchaser shall
deliver to the relevant Seller any of the documents or other deliverables
required to be delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_ to the extent
related to the Deferred Business and not previously delivered to the relevant
Seller at the Closing, and (B) the relevant Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
any of the documents or other deliverables required to be delivered pursuant
to _Section 2.3(b)(i)_ to the extent related to the Deferred Business and not
previously delivered to Purchaser at the Closing.

  

#### (v) In respect of each Deferred Business, Sellers and
Purchaser shall continue to comply through the applicable Deferred Closing
Date (or Deferred Closing Outside Date) with all covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement that are required by their terms to be performed
prior to the Closing, including the covenants of Sellers contained in _Section
5.4_ and the covenants of the Parties contained in _Section 5.3_.

  

#### (vi) If any equity interests of the Specified Deferred
Business not currently owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, are acquired
by Parent following the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date or Deferred
Closing Date, as applicable, including as a result of the exercise of the
rights identified on _Section 2.9(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, (A)
the equity interests so acquired shall be transferred to Purchaser at the
Closing Date or Deferred Closing Date, as applicable, (B) Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid the purchase price therefor, up to the amount specified in
_Section 2.9(b)(vi)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and (C) each of Parent
and Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid 50% of the excess of the purchase
price therefor over _Section 2.9(b)(vi)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
Parent and Purchaser shall jointly control any negotiations with respect to
such acquisition, and neither Parent nor Purchaser shall agree to any
acquisition without the other's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  

### (c) _Delayed Reversions_.

  

#### (i) If, as of the Closing, any approval (" _Delayed
Reversion Approvals_ ") required to transfer the shares of the entity listed
on _Section 2.9(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (" _Delayed Reversion
Entity_ ") held by any member of the Education Group to any member of the
Parent Group has not been obtained, then on the third (3rd) Business Day after
all the Delayed Reversion Approvals have been obtained (" _Delayed Reversion
Date_ ") Purchaser shall, and shall cause the members of the Education Group
to, sell, assign, transfer and convey to the applicable Seller or another
entity designated by such Seller, and the applicable Seller shall purchase,
acquire and accept from Purchaser and Transferred Companies, all of the right,
title and interest of Purchaser and the Transferred Companies in the Delayed
Reversion Entity.

  

#### 

  

       

  

  



  

#### (ii) If the Delayed Reversion Approvals have not been
obtained prior to the Closing Date, then during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the Delayed Reversion Date, Purchaser shall provide
Seller with its reasonable cooperation in obtaining the Delayed Reversion
Approvals.

  

#### (iii) If the Delayed Reversion Approvals have not been
obtained prior to the Closing Date, then during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the Delayed Reversion Date, except as Sellers may
consent in writing, Purchaser shall conduct the operations of the Delayed
Reversion Entity in the ordinary course consistent with past practice (except
that Purchaser shall not be required to invest any additional funds into a
Delayed Reversion Entity), and Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit the
Delayed Reversion Entity to: (A) except in the ordinary course of business,
incur or assume any liabilities, obligations or indebtedness for borrowed
money; (B) make or pay any dividend or distribution, whether of cash or other
assets; or (C) sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of any asset of the
Delayed Reversion Entity to any Person except for sales of inventory or
product in the ordinary course of business.

  

 _2.10_ _Witholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Purchaser is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. Subject to _Section 7.13_ , to the extent that such amounts are so withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Entity by Purchaser, such withheld and deducted amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Purchaser. Purchaser shall deliver to Parent a receipt evidencing the payment of any such withheld and deducted amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity.

  



  

# Article III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

  

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Purchaser prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ") (

Companies and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  


  

 _3.2_ _Capitalization of the Members of the Education Group_. Section 3.2 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of the Shares as of the date hereof.

 _3.3_ _Authority Relative to this Agreement_.

material to the Education Group, including the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Assuming compliance with the items described
in clauses (i) through (iii) of the preceding sentence, neither the execution,

incorporation or by-laws (or similar governing documents) of Sellers or any
member of the Education Group, (2) result in a breach, violation or
infringement of, or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or

Permitted Liens, or any right of termination, amendment, cancellation or
acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Material Contract or Lease or (3) violate or infringe any Law applicable to
any member of the Education Group or any of their respective properties or

## _3.10_ _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term " _Benefit
Plan_ " shall mean each compensation and/or benefit plan, program, policy,
practice, contract, agreement or other arrangement (whether or not such plan
is subject to ERISA), including any employee welfare plan within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of ERISA, any employee pension benefit plan within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA, and any bonus, incentive, deferred compensation,
vacation, stock purchase, stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock-based
rights, medical, profit sharing, insurance, retirement, supplemental
retirement, severance, retention, termination, employment, change-of-control
or fringe benefit plan, program or agreement, whether or not in writing and
whether or not funded, in each case that is sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by Sellers or any of their Affiliates for the benefit of the
current or former employees, directors, consultants or independent contractors
of the Business or with respect to which Sellers or any of their Affiliates
have any actual or contingent Liability with respect to the Business;
_provided_ , _however_ , that "Benefit Plan" shall not include any statutory
arrangement under applicable Law, any author agreement or any contributor
agreement, (ii) the term " _Business Employee Plan_ " means each Benefit Plan
maintained, sponsored or contributed to solely for the benefit of the Business
Employees located in the United States, (iii) the term " _Parent Plan_ " means
a Benefit Plan maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Sellers or any of
their Affiliates for the benefit of Business Employees and other employees of
Sellers and their Subsidiaries, and (iv) the term " _Non-U.S. Business
Employee Plan_ " means each Benefit Plan maintained, sponsored or contributed
to solely for the benefit of the Business Employees located outside the United
States. _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Business Employee Plan, each Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan and each material
Parent Plan. No Parent Plan is sponsored by any member of the Education
Group.

  

### (b) With respect to each material Benefit Plan, Sellers have
made available to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies of the plan
document, including all amendments thereto, and the current summary plan
description and any modifications thereto. Except as specifically provided in
the documents made available to Purchaser pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence and as set forth in _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no amendments
to, or proposals to suspend or terminate, any material Benefit Plan that have
been adopted or approved, nor have Sellers or any member of the Education
Group undertaken to make any such amendments or such proposals or to adopt or
approve any new material Benefit Plan. With respect to each Business Employee
Plan and the Parent Savings Plan, Sellers have made available to Purchaser
true, correct and complete copies of (in the case of each of clauses (i)
through (iv) below) to the extent applicable) (i) the two most recent Form
5500, any attached financial statement and any related actuarial reports, (ii)
the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter with respect to such
Benefit Plan and related trust intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code and any pending request for such determination letter, (iii) all
related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding

  

       

  

  

vehicles and (iv) all material correspondence to or from IRS, the United
States Department of Labor (" _DOL_ "), the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity received in the last
three years, including any filings under the IRS's Employee Plans Compliance
Resolution System Program or any of its predecessors or of the DOL's
Delinquent Filer Program, if any. With respect to each material Non-U.S.
Business Employee Plan, the Sellers have made available to Purchaser true,
correct and complete copies of all related trust documents, insurance
contracts or other funding vehicles.

  



  

### (c) Except as would not result in any Liability to
Purchaser or its Affiliates, each Parent Plan (including any related trusts)
has been maintained and administered in compliance with its terms and with
applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code to the extent applicable thereto.
Each Business Employee Plan (including any related trusts) has been maintained
and administered in material compliance with its terms and with applicable
Law, including ERISA and the Code to the extent applicable thereto. Each of
the Business Employee Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code and the Parent Savings Plan have received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely upon a
favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there
are no existing circumstances or any events that have occurred that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
plan. All material contributions and premiums required to have been paid by
Sellers, their Affiliates, any member of the Education Group, or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates under the terms of any Business Employee Plan or
Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan, or related funding arrangement, or pursuant
to any applicable Law have been paid within the time so prescribed or have
been properly accrued in accordance with GAAP. No current or former employee,
director, consultant or independent contractor of the Business has been
improperly excluded from participation in any Business Employee Plan or
Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan.

  

### (d) No Business Employee Plan provides for medical,
disability, life insurance or other welfare benefits with respect to any of
the Business Employees beyond their retirement or other termination of
service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable Law and at the expense
of the employee or former employee or (ii) benefits under any "employee
pension benefit plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA). No
Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan provides for medical, disability, life
insurance or other welfare benefits with respect to any of the Business
Employees beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than
(i) coverage mandated by applicable Law or (ii) benefits under any defined
contribution or defined benefit pension plan. No Business Employee Plan is
subject to Title IV of ERISA and no Business Employee Plan is or has within
the last six (6) years been subject to Title IV of ERISA or the minimum
funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code. No Business Employee Plan is
a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are
not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA. None
of Sellers, any member of the Education Group or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates contributes to or, within the last six years, has contributed to,
had any obligation to contribute to, or withdrawn in a complete or partial
withdrawal from any "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA) that is a pension plan under ERISA. No liability under
Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by Sellers, any member of the Education
Group or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied
in full (other than with respect to amounts not yet due) and that would
reasonably be expected to subject any member of

  

       

  

  

the Education Group or any Business Employee Plan to any Liability, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk to the members of the Education
Group of incurring any ERISA Affiliate Liability. There are no pending,
threatened or, to the Knowledge of Parent, anticipated claims (other than
claims for benefits in accordance with the terms of the Business Employee
Plans or Non-U.S. Business Employee Plans, as applicable) by, on behalf of or
against any of the Business Employee Plans or Non-U.S. Business Employee
Plans, or any trusts related thereto, that could reasonably be expected to
result in any Liability of the members of the Education Group. None of
Sellers, any Affiliates of Sellers, any Business Employee Plan, or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any trustee, administrator, other third-party fiduciary
and/or party-in-interest of a Business Employee Plan, has engaged in any
breach of fiduciary responsibility or any "prohibited transaction" (as such
term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code), to which
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code applies and which would
reasonably be expected to subject any member of the Education Group or any
Business Employee Plan to any material tax or material penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or by ERISA.

  



  

### (e) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or in
combination with another event) (i) entitle any Business Employee or
consultant of the Business to any severance payment, (ii) result in any
material payment from any member of the Education Group becoming due, or
increase the amount of any compensation due, to any Business Employee or
consultant of the Business, (iii) increase any benefits otherwise payable to a
Business Employee or consultant of the Business under any Benefit Plan, (iv)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
compensation or benefits from Sellers, any member of the Education Group or
any of their Affiliates to any Business Employee or consultant of the
Business, (v) result in any forgiveness of indebtedness with respect to any
Business Employee or consultant of the Business, (vi) trigger any funding
obligation under any Business Employee Plan or Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan
or impose any restrictions or limitations on the right of any members of the
Education Group to administer, amend or terminate any Business Employee Plan
or Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan, or (vii) result in any payment or deemed
payment (whether in cash, property, the vesting of property or otherwise) to
any Business Employee, former employee of the Business, or consultant of the
Business or any of their respective Affiliates who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
that could reasonably be construed, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code); provided, however, that the representation
set forth in this sentence shall not apply with respect to any arrangement
established by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. No Business Employee or
consultant of the Business is entitled to receive any additional payment
(including any tax gross-up or other payment) from any Sellers, any member of
the Education Group or any of their Affiliates as a result of the imposition
of the excise Taxes required by Section 4999 of the Code or any Taxes required
by Section 409A of the Code.

  

### (f) Except for those matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably be expected to be material to
the Education Group, including the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole: (i) each Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan (A)
complies with applicable local Law, (B) is fully funded and/or book

  

       

  

  

reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions, to the
extent such plan is intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, (C) has been
registered to the extent required, and has been maintained in good standing
with applicable regulatory authorities and, (D) if intended to qualify for
special Tax treatment, meets all requirements for such treatment, and (ii) as
of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened litigation relating to any Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan.

  



  

### (g) Each Business Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" (as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of
the Code) is in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations thereunder.

  

## _3.11_ _Employees; Labor Matters_.

  

### (a) Sellers have, to the extent permitted under applicable
Law, made available to Purchaser a true, correct and complete list as of the

had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (i) there is no unfair labor practice,
labor dispute (other than routine individual grievances) or labor arbitration
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened with respect to
the Business Employees, and (ii) with respect to the Business Employees,
Sellers and their Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Laws
respecting (A) employment and employment practices, (B) terms and conditions
of employment and wages and hours, (C) workers' compensation, occupational
safety and health, immigration, affirmative action and employee privacy, (D)
unfair labor practices and (E) pay equity and the collection and payment of
withholding, social security and other Taxes. Sellers and their Affiliates
have complied with all legal and/or contractual obligations to notify and/or
consult with the unions, works councils and/or other entities representing the
Business Employees, of the intention of Sellers and Purchaser to enter into
this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
have obtained all required approvals and consents from any and all such
unions, works councils and other entities, and, to the Knowledge of Parent,
there are no legal or contractual claims that may be asserted by any union,
works council, other entity representing the Business Employees, or by any
employee or employee group, which could prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the representation in this sentence
shall not apply with respect to any action or inaction taken (or omitted) by
or at the direction of Purchaser.

  

### 

  

       

  

  



  

### (c) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
or would not reasonably be expected to be, material to the Education Group,
including the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
with respect to the operation of the Business, none of Sellers, any member of
the Education Group or any of their Affiliates has any direct or indirect
liability, whether actual or contingent, with respect to any misclassification
of any person as an independent contractor rather than as an employee, with
respect to any misclassification of any employee as exempt versus non-exempt
within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1933, as amended, and
the regulations thereunder, or with respect to any employee leased from
another employer. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
Business Employee listed on _Section 3.11(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule has given notice of his or her intent to terminate employment. To
the Knowledge of Parent, no Business Employee listed on _Section 3.11(c)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule is in violation in any material respect of any
term of any employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement or noncompetition
agreement, which violation has or could reasonably be expected have a material
effect on the Business.

  

### (d) No member of the Education Group has any unsatisfied
Liabilities or is reasonably expected to incur any Liabilities under the

applicable state, local or foreign Law (collectively, " _WARN_ ") as a result
of any action taken by Sellers or any of their Affiliates, including actions
taken at the written direction of Parent or as a result of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

simple or equivalent title to all Owned Real Property, free and clear of all
Liens (including any occupancy rights), except Permitted Liens, and except as,
individually or in the aggregate, would not or would not reasonably be

### (b) Section 3.12(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and

  

       

  

  

accurate list as of the date hereof of all of the real property leased or that
will be leased as of the Closing Date by the members of the Education Group
(the " _Leased Real Property_ "), pursuant to a lease, sublease, license,
occupancy or other agreement (each, a " _Lease_ " and collectively, the "
_Leases_ "). The members of the Education Group have, or will have as of the
Closing Date, a valid leasehold, subleasehold or other occupancy (as
applicable) interest in all Leased Real Property, free and clear of all Liens,
except Permitted Liens, except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not

applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfers, or similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to
enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
Law), except for failures to be in full force and effect or enforceable that
individually or in the aggregate, are not or would not reasonably be expected
to be, material to the Education Group, including the Transferred Companies
and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No member of the Education Group is
in breach or default under any Lease and no event has occurred that with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a breach or default by
any member of the Education Group, except as, individually or in the
aggregate, would not or would not reasonably be expected to be, material to
the Education Group, including the Transferred Companies and their
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No member of the Education Group has received
any written notice of a breach or default under any Lease, and to the

occupy any of the Leased Real Property.

  



  

### (c) The Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property
constitute all of the real property that is material to the operation of the
Business. Except as, individually or in the aggregate, is not or would not

Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, there is no
pending or threatened appropriation, condemnation or like Action, or sale or
other disposition in lieu of condemnation, affecting the Owned Real Property
or any part thereof, or to the Knowledge of Parent, the Leased Real Property
or any part thereof.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

## _5.1_ _Access to Books and Records_.

  

### (a) After the date of this Agreement, Sellers shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, afford to Purchaser, its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other representatives reasonable access to
the employees, properties, books, contracts and records, of the members of the
Education Group during normal business hours, upon reasonable written notice
and in accordance with the procedures established by Sellers, and, during such
period, Sellers shall (and shall cause each Transferred Company to) furnish
promptly to Purchaser all information concerning the Business, properties and
personnel as may be reasonably requested; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no
Seller nor any Transferred Company shall be required, in the good faith
judgment of such Seller or Transferred Company, to violate any obligation of
confidentiality to which a Seller or any member of the Education Group may be
subject in discharging their obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.1(a)_;
(ii) Sellers shall make available, or cause the members of the Education Group
to make available, only upon or after the Closing, all Business Employee
personnel files; and (iii) prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not
conduct any sampling of soil, sediment, surface water, ground water or
building material at, on, under or within any facility on the Owned Real
Property or the Leased Real Property; _provided_ _further_ ¸ for the avoidance
of doubt, that Purchaser may make any such information available to the Debt
Financing Sources (subject, in the case of material non-public information, to
customary confidentiality undertakings).

  

### (b) Purchaser agrees that any permitted investigation
undertaken by Purchaser pursuant to the access granted under _Section 5.1(a)_
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operation of the Business by Sellers or the members of the Education Group,
and Purchaser and its representatives shall not communicate with any of the

  

       

  

  

employees of Sellers or the members of the Education Group without the prior
written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed or withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither Sellers nor any member of the Education Group shall be
required to provide access to or disclose information where, upon the advice
of counsel, such access or disclosure would reasonably be expected to result
in the inability to successfully assert a claim of attorney-client privilege
of such Party, or contravene any applicable Laws; _provided_ that the Parties
hereto shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure
of such information without jeopardizing the attorney-client privilege of such
Party. 


  

### (c) At and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, afford Sellers and their respective
representatives, during normal business hours, upon reasonable written notice,
access to the books, records, properties and employees of each member of the
Education Group to the extent that such access may be reasonably requested by
Sellers, including in connection with financial statements and SEC reporting
obligations; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall
limit Sellers' rights of discovery.

  

(d) Purchaser agrees to hold all the books and records of each member of
the Education Group existing on the Closing Date and not to destroy or dispose
of any thereof for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date or such
longer time as may be required by applicable Law, and thereafter, if it
desires to destroy or dipose of such books and records, to use its reasonable
best efforts to offer first in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to such
destruction or disposition to surrender them to Sellers.

  

 _5.2_ _Confidentiality_. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser's confidentiality obligations shall terminate only in respect of that portion of the Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively relating to the Business. If, for any reason, the sale of the Shares is not consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. After the Closing, until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers shall hold and shall cause each of their entity Affiliates to hold, and each Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its and its entity Affiliates' respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by Order or Law, all confidential documents and information concerning the Education Group, except to the extent that such information can be shown by Sellers to have been (a) previously known on a non-confidential basis by Sellers; (b) in the public domain through no fault of Sellers or their Affiliates or (c) later lawfully acquired by Sellers from sources other than those related to their prior ownership of the Education Group.

each of Purchaser and Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws
to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i)
preparing as promptly as

  

       

  

  

practicable all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings (or, if
required by the applicable Governmental Entity, a draft thereof), ruling
requests, and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits,
rulings, authorizations, expiration of applicable waiting periods and
clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Entity
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Governmental Approvals_ ") and (ii) as promptly as
practicable taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such
Governmental Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each Party hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate and complete
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby within ten (10) Business Days of the
date of this Agreement, (B) make all other required filings (or, if required
by the applicable Governmental Entity, a draft thereof) pursuant to other
Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable, and (C) not extend any waiting period under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law, nor enter into any agreement with the FTC or
the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other Party hereto. Each Party shall use its best efforts to cause all
necessary filings in all Deferred Closing Jurisdictions to be made no later
than five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement. As promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and Sellers shall use

practicable any additional information or documentation that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its reasonable best
efforts to take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
and any other Antitrust Law as soon as possible.

  



  

### (b) Each of Purchaser and Sellers shall, in connection with
the actions referenced in _Section 5.3(a)_ to obtain all Governmental
Approvals for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate in all respects with each other
in connection with any communication, filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by
a private party; (ii) keep the other Party and/or its counsel informed of any
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the FTC,
the DOJ or any other U.S. or other Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby;
(iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with the
FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental Entity or other
person, give the other Party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences; and (iv) except for Parties'
Notification and Report Forms and attachments thereto filed under the HSR Act,
permit the other Party and/or its counsel to review in advance any submission,
filing or communication (and documents submitted therewith) intended to be
given by it to the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity; _provided_
that materials may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation
of the businesses of Sellers. Purchaser and Sellers, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material to be
provided to the other under this _Section 5.3(b)_ as " _Antitrust Counsel
Only Material_." Such materials and the information

  

       

  

  

contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Purchaser or Sellers, as the case
may be) or its legal counsel.

  



  

### (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants
of the Parties contained in _Sections 5.3(a)_ and _5.3(b)_ , each of
Purchaser, Sellers and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing on or before the
Outside Date, including defending through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in any court with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or
any private party; and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Antitrust Law so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such businesses,
product lines or assets of Purchaser and the members of the Education Group,
(y) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing
would limit Purchaser's and/or its Subsidiaries' freedom of action with
respect to, or its or their ability to operate and/or retain, one or more of
the businesses, product lines or assets of Purchaser or the members of the
Education Group, and (z) agreeing to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate,
or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of
action with respect to, or Purchaser's or Purchaser's Subsidiaries' ability to
operate or retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Purchaser
or the members of the Education Group; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
action contemplated by clauses (x), (y) and (z) is conditioned upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### (d) Without limiting any other obligation under this
Agreement, during the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date, each of Purchaser and Sellers shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates to not, take or agree to take any
action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the Parties from
obtaining any Governmental Approval in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or to prevent or materially delay or impede
the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include ordinary course trading in debt).

  

### (e) Purchaser agrees to provide such security and
assurances as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may
be reasonably requested by any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval
is sought in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Whether or
not the Sale is consummated, Purchaser and Parent shall each be responsible
for 50% of all filing fees and payments to any Governmental Entity in order to
obtain any consents, approvals or waivers pursuant to this _Section 5.3_.

For the avoidance of doubt, intercompany accounts between and among any member of the Education Group shall not be affected by this provision.

  



  

## _5.8_ _Guarantees; Commitments._

  

### (a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall and shall
cause the members of the Education Group to, jointly and severally, indemnify
and hold harmless each member of the Parent Group and their respective
managers, officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, successors
and assigns (collectively, " _Parent Indemnitees_ ") against any Losses that
any Parent Indemnitee suffers, incurs or is liable for by reason of or arising
out of or in consequence of: (i) any Parent Indemnitee issuing, making
payment under, being required to pay or reimburse the issuer of, or being a
party to, any guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit, bank
guarantee, keepwell agreement, consumer financing arrangements, or other
similar commitment, understanding, agreement or obligation relating to the
Business listed on _Section 5.8(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Guarantees_ "); (ii) any claim or demand for
payment made on any Parent Indemnitee with respect to any of the Indemnified
Guarantees; or (iii) any Action, claim or proceeding by any Person who is or
claims to be entitled to the benefit of or claims to be entitled to payment,
reimbursement or indemnity with respect to any Indemnified Guarantees.

  

### (b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause itself or the members of the Education Group to be
substituted in all respects for each member of the Parent Group, and for each
member of the Parent Group to be released, effective

  

       

  

  

as of the Closing or (if such substitution and release cannot be effected as
of the Closing) as soon as reasonably possible after the Closing (and, in any
event, no later than 30 days after Closing), in respect of all obligations of
each member of the Parent Group under each of the Indemnified Guarantees. At
Parent's request, Purchaser will, and will cause the members of the Education
Group to, assign or cause to be assigned, any lease underlying an Indemnified
Guarantee to an Affiliate of Purchaser meeting the applicable net worth and
other requirements in such lease to give effect to the provisions of the
preceding sentence. For any Indemnified Guarantees for which Purchaser or the
members of the Education Group, as applicable, is not substituted in all
respects for each member of the Parent Group (or for which each member of the
Parent Group is not released) effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall
continue to use commercially reasonable efforts and shall cause the members of
the Education Group to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such
substitution and release as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing,
and Parent and Sellers shall continue to reasonably cooperate in Purchaser's
efforts. Purchaser further agrees that, to the extent the beneficiary or
counterparty under any Indemnified Guarantee does not accept any such
substitute arrangement proffered by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser or
to the extent each member of the Parent Group is not fully and irrevocably
released and discharged, Purchaser hereby agrees to: (i) indemnify each member
of the Parent Group for any and all amounts paid, including all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in maintaining such
Indemnified Guarantee for each member of the Parent Group, and (ii) promptly
reimburse each member of the Parent Group to the extent any Indemnified
Guarantee is called upon and such member of the Parent Group makes any payment
or is obligated to reimburse the Party issuing such Indemnified Guarantee. For
the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall not replace any letters of credit or
any other collateral which relates to any collateral provided by Sellers under
any Seller insurance policy(ies) or self-insured programs.

  



  

## _5.9_ _Insurance_.

  

### (a) From and after the Closing Date, the members of the
Education Group shall cease to be insured by the insurance policies held by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or by any of their self-insured programs,
and neither Purchaser nor its Subsidiaries shall have any right, title or
interest to or in any such insurance policies (including to all claims and
rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover any assets of the
members of the Education Group or any Liability arising from the operation of
the Business on or after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ that (i)
Purchaser shall continue to have the benefits of available insurance pursuant
to this _Section 5.9_ exercisable by requesting that Parent make claims under
such policies and programs with respect to losses occurring (whether known or
unknown) before the Closing Date to the extent insurance coverage in respect
of such claims may be available, (ii) the members of the Parent Group shall
diligently pursue such claims, consult with Purchaser prior to making any
material decision or taking any material action relating to such claim and
take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with the tendering of such claims to the applicable insurers under
such policies, and (iii) shall provide Purchaser with the net proceeds they
realize with respect to such claims; _provided_ , _further_ , that (A)
Purchaser shall be liable for all uninsured or self-insured amounts in respect
of such claims and (B) Purchaser agrees to reimburse, upon the request of
Parent, the applicable members of the Parent Group for all out-of-pocket costs
incurred by any member of the Parent Group associated with Purchaser-initiated
claims, including costs of filing a claim, arbitration costs, any deductibles
and premium increases under the insurance policies and programs resulting from
such claims. Each

  

       

  

  

Seller or any of its respective Affiliates may, in its reasonable discretion,
to be effective as of the Closing, amend any insurance policies in the manner
it deems appropriate to give effect to this _Section 5.9_ ; _provided _ that
no Seller nor any of its Affiliates may take any action that would reduce,
modify or eliminate any coverage, terms and conditions or policy limits to the
detriment of the Education Group or Purchaser under any insurance policy
presently available to the Education Group for any claims related to pre-
Closing occurrences. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be
responsible for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for its
operation of the Education Group and the Business. Purchaser further
covenants and agrees not to seek or assert directly from the insurer, or the
exercise any rights or claims of any member of the Education Group or the
Business under or in respect of any past or current insurance policy under
which any Transferred Company or Affiliate thereof or the Business is an
additional insured.

  



  

### (b) Sellers agree to execute, or cause to be executed, and
deliver affidavits and other customary documentation in customary form, as
reasonably required by Stewart Title Guaranty Company to induce such insurer
to issue owner's policies of title insurance for the Owned Real Property or
any portion thereof including fee title to the applicable Owned Real Property
subject only to Permitted Liens and containing or accompanied by such
affirmative insurance and endorsements (including a so-called non-imputation
endorsement) as Purchaser shall reasonably request, _provided_ that Seller and

### (a) For a period of eighteen (18) months from the Closing

otherwise required by Law, to provide, on terms that are no less favorable,
all rights to indemnification and all limitations on liability currently

(or their respective predecessors) (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_
"), as provided in (i) the organizational documents of the members of the
Education Group in effect on the date of this Agreement or (ii) any agreement
providing for indemnification by the members of the Education Group of any of
the Seller Indemnitees in effect on the date of this Agreement to which

### (b) In the event that any member of the Education Group or
Purchaser or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)

Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the members of the Education Group or Purchaser,
as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
_Section 5.13_.

  

### (c) The obligations of Purchaser under this _Section 5.13
_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to materially and
adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.13_ applies without
the written consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed
that the indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.13_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.13_). 

 _5.14_ _Financing._

  

### (a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts (taking
into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or

  

       

  

  

cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and to
consummate the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letters; _provided_ , that Purchaser
may (i) amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers,
book-runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) otherwise
replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letters, in each case so long as such
action would not be prohibited by the following sentence. Purchaser shall not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision under, the Commitment Letters without the prior written consent of
Sellers if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver:

  



  

#### (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount as compared to such fees and original issue discount contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter and related fee letters in effect on the date
hereof unless the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is increased by such
amount);

  

#### (ii) (A) imposes new or additional conditions precedent to
the Financing, or (B) otherwise adversely expands, amends or modifies any of
the conditions precedent to the Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any other provision of the Commitment Letters, in the case of this
clause (B), in a manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the ability of Purchaser to consummate the Closing; or

  

#### (iii) would materially adversely impact the ability of
Purchaser to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment
Letters or otherwise to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Sellers copies of any such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement. For purposes of this Agreement,
references to "Financing" or "Debt Financing," as applicable, shall include
the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as permitted to be
amended, modified, waived or replaced by this _Section 5.14(a)_ or by
_Section 5.14(c)_ and references to "Debt Commitment Letters" shall include
such documents as permitted to be amended, modified, waived or replaced by
this _Section 5.14(a)_ or _Section 5.14(c)_.

  

### (b) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Commitment Letters; (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements (which, with respect to the bridge facility
documentation, shall not be required until reasonably necessary in connection
with the funding of the Debt Financing) with respect to the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary to obtain
the Financing, the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee letter), or
on other terms no less favorable in any material respect to Purchaser as to
conditionality than the terms and conditions in the Commitment Letters;
_provided_ , that in no event shall any such definitive agreement contain
terms (other than those included in the Debt Commitment Letter) that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing; (iii)
provide Parent with copies of all substantially final drafts of such
definitive agreements; (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Purchaser contained in the Debt Commitment Letters that are
within its control (or, if deemed advisable by Purchaser, seek the waiver of
conditions applicable to Purchaser contained in the Debt Commitment Letters),
including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement fees

  

       

  

  

required as a condition to the Debt Financing and due and payable by
Purchaser, as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, (v) enforce its rights
under the Debt Commitment Letters, (vi) upon satisfaction of all of the
conditions precedent under _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2 _ (except those that, by
their nature, are to be satisfied at Closing, provided such conditions would
be so satisfied as of such date), cause the funding of the Debt Financing at
or prior to Closing (together with other sources of funds, with respect to the
Required Amount); (vii) give Sellers prompt notice of any material breach by
any party to the Debt Commitment Letters of which Purchaser has become aware
or any termination of, or any notice of intention by any funding source not to
provide the Financing contemplated in, any of the Commitment Letters; (viii)
upon request of the Parent, Purchaser shall apprise Parent of material
developments relating to the Financing.

  



  

### Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this _Section 5.14 _ shall require, and in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Purchaser be deemed or construed to require,
Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof to (i) seek the Equity Financing from any
source other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that
contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letters, or (ii) pay any material fees
in excess of those contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letters or the Debt
Commitment Letters.

  

### (c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters shall be terminated for any reason,
Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers in writing and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions (including all terms, termination
rights, flex provisions and funding conditions) no less favorable to Purchaser
as those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters and in an amount sufficient,
together with the Equity Financing, available cash on hand of Purchaser and
cash on hand of the Transferred Companies and their Subsidiaries available for
application to the Required Amount, if any, on the Closing Date, to fund the
Required Amount (the " _Alternate Financing_ ") and, if obtained, will provide
Parent with a copy of a new financing commitment that provides such Alternate
Financing (an " _Alternate Debt Commitment Letter_ "). To the extent
applicable, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts (taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
promptly and consummate the Alternate Financing on the terms and conditions
described in any Alternate Debt Commitment Letter, including by using
reasonable best efforts to comply with its obligations under _Section
5.14(b)_ above as though the references therein to Debt Commitment Letters and
Debt Financing were instead references to the Alternate Debt Commitment Letter
and the Alternate Financing, respectively.

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser may
enter discussions regarding, and may enter into arrangements and agreements
relating to the Financing to add other equity providers, so long as in respect
of any such arrangements and agreements, the following conditions are met:
(i) the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing is not reduced; (ii) the
arrangements and agreements, in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely
to delay or prevent the Closing; and (iii) the arrangements and agreements
would not diminish or release the pre-closing obligations of the parties to
the Equity Commitment Letters, adversely affect the rights of Purchaser to
enforce its rights against the parties to the Equity Commitment Letters, or
otherwise constitute a waiver or reduction of Purchaser's rights under the
Equity Commitment Letters.

  

       

  

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that (i) all or any portion of the
Debt Financing contemplated to be raised in lieu of the bridge financing
contemplated under the Debt Commitment Letters has not been consummated, (ii)
the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied or waived, and
(iii) all of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their nature are to
be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions),
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the proceeds of the
bridge facility contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters to be used to
cause the Closing to occur in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereunder.

  

### (d) Prior to the Closing, or as expressly provided in clause
(iv) below, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and to cause
the members of the Education Group and the Sellers' and the members of the
Education Group's respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
consultants, advisors, (including legal, financial and accounting advisors),
and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, provide to
Purchaser such cooperation as is reasonably requested by Purchaser and the
Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing ( _provided_ that
such requested cooperation does not materially and adversely interfere with
the ongoing operations of Sellers and its Subsidiaries), including:

  

#### (i) assisting in preparation for and participation in
marketing efforts (including lender meetings and calls), other meetings,
drafting sessions, rating agency presentations, road shows and due diligence
sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions with
prospective lenders, investors and ratings agencies and assisting Purchaser in
obtaining ratings as contemplated by the Debt Financing;

  

#### (ii) assisting Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources in

Financing; and (B) materials for rating agency presentations;

  

#### (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable (A) furnishing
Purchaser and Purchaser's financing sources (including the Debt Financing
Sources) and their respective Representatives with the Required Information
and (B) informing Purchaser if Sellers or their Subsidiaries shall have
knowledge of any facts that would likely require the restatement of such
financial statements for such financial statements to comply with GAAP;

  

#### (iv) both before the Closing and, to the extent reasonably
necessary to allow Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to consummate a
securities offering or comply with SEC requirements, after the Closing,

requesting accountants' consents in connection with the use of the Education

other documents to be filed with the SEC;

_provided_ that neither Sellers nor any of their Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be responsible in any manner for information relating to
the proposed debt and equity capitalization that is required for such pro
forma financial information;

  

#### (vi) using reasonable best efforts to provide (x) monthly
financial reports consistent with Sellers' past practice, (y) within forty-

to solvency matters in the form set forth as an annex to the Debt Commitment
Letters) and otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral (including (x)
cooperation in connection with the pay-off of existing Indebtedness to the
extent contemplated by this Agreement and the release of related Liens and
termination of security interest and (y) cooperation in connection with
Purchaser's efforts to obtain environmental assessments and title insurance);

  

#### (viii) assisting Purchaser to obtain waivers, consents, estoppels

encumbrances and Contracts as of the Closing;

  

#### (ix) taking all reasonable actions necessary to (A) permit

#### (xii) using reasonable best efforts to assist Purchaser in the
implementation of the corporate restructuring of the Education Group in
accordance with the Debt Financing (for the avoidance of doubt, such
restructuring to be effective only upon the Closing); _provided_ that,
anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
the Sellers Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses or Taxes

Indemnified Parties as a result of the consummation of the Plan of
Reorganization or otherwise by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than this clause (xii)).

  

### _provided_ that neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
Liability, in each case, in connection with the Financing (in the case of the
Education Group, prior to the Closing); _provided_ , _further_ , that the

financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than any
information provided in writing by or on behalf of Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection with the Financing), in each
case other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises from the bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or breach of this Agreement by,
Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates and
Representatives. Any information provided to Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section 5.14(d)_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and

use reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required Information
provided to Purchaser as may be necessary so that such Required Information is
(i) Compliant, (ii) meets the applicable requirements set forth in the
definition of "Required Information" and (iii) would not, after giving effect
to such update(s), result in the Marketing Period to cease to be deemed to
have commenced. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser may, to most
effectively access the financing markets, require the cooperation of Sellers
and their Subsidiaries under this _Section 5.14_ at any time, and from time
to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the Closing;
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Marketing Period shall not be
applicable as to each attempt to access the markets. Sellers shall timely
file SEC documents and other materials with the SEC to the extent required by
the SEC in accordance with Law to the extent such SEC documents relate
specifically to the Education Group. In addition, if, in connection with a
marketing effort contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, Purchaser
reasonably requests Sellers to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to
the Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with respect to
the Education Group, which Purchaser reasonably determines to include in a
customary offering memorandum for the Debt Financing, then Sellers shall file
a Current Report on Form 8-K containing such material non-public information.

  

### (g) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause
their Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
independent auditors to provide, consistent with customary practice, (A)
consent to SEC filings and offering memoranda that include or incorporate the

thereon, in each case, to the extent such consent is required, customary
auditors reports and customary comfort letters (including " _negative

Education Group, (B) reasonable assistance in the preparation of pro forma
financial statements by Purchaser and (C) reasonable assistance and
cooperation to Purchaser, including attending accounting due diligence

### (h) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 2.3_ to the
contrary, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_,
notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, Purchaser shall
not be required to effect the Closing until the earlier of (i) a date during
the Marketing Period specified by Purchaser on not less than two (2) Business
Days' notice to Sellers and (ii) the third (3rd) Business Day immediately
following the final day of the Marketing Period (subject, in each case, to the
satisfaction or waiver in writing of all of the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_ as of the date determined pursuant to this _Section
5.14(h)_).

  

 _5.15_ _Shared Contracts_. Prior to or at the Closing, each Shared Contract shall be assigned (subject to _Section 5.5_ ), partitioned, retained or otherwise addressed as set forth on _Schedule V_ hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event shall any assignment be required with respect to any Shared Contract which is not assignable by its terms (it being understood, however, that: (i) each Party shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and used its commercially reasonable efforts to do, or cause to have been done, and assisted and cooperated with the other Party in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to have obtained such assignment of any such Shared Contract, (ii) Parent shall consider in good faith all comments made by Purchaser on, and consult with Purchaser

  

##  

  

       

  

  



  

  prior to, making any material decision or taking any material action
relating to any Shared Contracts set forth on _Schedule V_ ; and (iii)
following the Closing, with respect to any Shared Contract which was intended
to be, but has not been, so assigned Parent and Sellers shall, consistent with
any contractual obligation or any applicable legal or fiduciary obligation
under applicable Law, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in a mutually
agreeable arrangement under which Parent and Sellers, on the one hand, and
Purchaser (or one or more of its Affiliates) on the other hand, would, in
compliance with applicable Law, obtain the benefits and assume the obligations
and bear the economic burdens under such Shared Contract. 

 _5.16_ _McGraw-Hill Marks and Domain Names_. The Parties hereby agree that upon the Closing, all worldwide right, title, and interest of Sellers and/or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser and/or its Affiliates (including the members of the Education Group), on the other hand, to own and/or use any McGraw-Hill Marks and Domain Names shall be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in the Trademark Coexistence Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in those jurisdictions where the coexistence described in such Trademark Coexistence Agreement is either (i) prohibited under applicable Law or (ii) otherwise precluded or prevented for any reason (including, without limitation, a refusal by the applicable trademark office or similar Governmental Entity), in either case, Sellers and the relevant members of the Education Group shall enter into a trademark license agreement governing each party's respective rights in such jurisdiction in a form that is mutually agreed upon by the parties thereto and pursuant to which Sellers grant a license to the members of the Education Group to use the applicable McGraw-Hill Marks and Domain Names in such jurisdiction. 

 _5.17_ _Resignation_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Purchaser duly signed resignations, effective as of the Closing, of all limited liability company managers, corporate directors and officers of the Education Group set forth on _Schedule 5.17_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule.

of the Education Group or one of its Affiliates to employ such Leave Employee
in accordance with the terms of this _Article VI_ ) as of the date such Leave
Employee returns to active employment (the " _Active Employment Date_ "). Any
Business Employee who is an employee of a member of the Education Group as of
the Closing shall be referred to as a " _Transferred Employee_ ". Each
Deferred Transfer Employee shall be considered a Transferred Employee
effective as of the Closing Date, and each Leave Employee shall be considered
a Transferred Employee effective as of the applicable Active Employment Date.
With respect to each Leave Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee, any
references to the termination of any employment-related obligations of Sellers
and their Affiliates and the assumption or commencement of employment-related
obligations by Purchaser and its Affiliates as of the Closing or Closing Date
(as applicable) will be deemed to apply instead as of the applicable Active
Employment Date. From and after the Closing, Purchaser assumes any
Liabilities arising out of the employment or termination of employment of any
Transferred Employee.

  



  

### (b) From and after the Closing, the Transferred Companies or
one of their Affiliates shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Transferred
Companies or one of their Affiliates to, honor all Business Employee Plans and
all Non-U.S. Business Employee Plans in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Closing, subject to any amendment or termination
thereof that is permitted by such Business Employee Plan or Non-U.S. Business
Employee Plan, as applicable, or to comply with applicable Law. For a period
of one year following the Closing (the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ "),
Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Transferred
Employee (i) base compensation and cash bonus opportunities that, in each
case, are no less favorable than were provided to the Transferred Employee
immediately before Closing and (ii) all other compensation and benefits (other
than any (A) equity or equity-based compensation (including the 2012 Cash
Performance Awards), (B) defined benefit pension, (C) retiree medical or (D)
change-in-control or sale compensation or enhanced benefit) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Transferred
Employee immediately before the Closing; _provided_ , that, subject to
_Section 6.1(c)_ of this Agreement and applicable Law, nothing herein shall
preclude Purchaser, the Transferred Companies or their respective Affiliates
from terminating the employment of any Transferred Employee, nor shall limit
Purchaser's, the Transferred Companies' or their respective Affiliates'
ability to modify compensation or benefits (other than health and welfare
benefits during 2013 and severance benefits) because of or in response to
performance issues with particular employees, groups of employees or business
units or in connection with business optimization plans or initiatives;
_provided_ , _further_ , that a Transferred Employee's wages or salary may be
decreased during the Benefits Continuation Period solely due to such
Transferred Employee's individual performance.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Transferred Companies or
one of their Affiliates to, provide to each Transferred Employee whose
employment is terminated, or who receives or gives notice of termination
during the one-year period following the Closing severance benefits equal to
the greater of (i) the severance benefits for which such Transferred Employee
was eligible under the

  

       

  

  

applicable severance arrangements of Sellers and their Affiliates as of
immediately prior to Closing (without taking into account any reduction after
the Closing in compensation paid to such Transferred Employee), and (ii) the
severance benefits provided for under the severance arrangements of Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries, assuming in each case that such termination qualified
the Transferred Employee to such benefit; _provided_ , _however_ , that with
respect to any Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated or who
receives or gives notice of termination during the six-month period following
the Closing under circumstances that would have entitled the Transferred
Employee to enhanced severance during 2012 under the severance arrangement of
Sellers and their Affiliates applicable to such Transferred Employee, for
purposes of clause (i) of this sentence, the level of severance for which such
Transferred Employee is eligible as of immediately prior to Closing shall be
deemed to be no less than any enhanced severance that would have been payable
upon such termination of employment during 2012 under the severance
arrangements of Sellers and their Affiliates set forth on _Section 6.1(c)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, in addition to
any other rights under the applicable severance arrangement, with respect to
any Transferred Employee, in the event that during the six-month period
following Closing, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (A) reduces such
Transferred Employee's base compensation by 10% or more or (B) relocates the
principal location of employment of such Transferred Employee by more than 50
miles, then, if such Transferred Employee provides notice to Purchaser within
30 days of the occurrence of an event described in clauses (A) and (B) and
Purchaser fails to cure such event within 30 days of such notice (the " _Cure
Period_ "), such Transferred Employee may terminate employment within 60 days
following the Cure Period and will be entitled to severance in accordance with
the first sentence of this _Section 6.1(c)_.

  



  

### (d) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting,
eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit
plans of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Transferred
Employees after the Closing, (other than any (i) equity compensation, (ii)
defined benefit pension plan or (iii) retiree medical plan), including the
Business Employee Plans and the Non-U.S. Business Employee Plans (the " _New
Plans_ "), each Transferred Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with Sellers and their Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Closing, to the same extent as such Transferred
Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under
any similar Benefit Plan in which such Transferred Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing, _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result
in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause (i) each Transferred Employee to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which such
Transferred Employee participated immediately before the Closing (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Transferred Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or
her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under the comparable plans of Sellers or its Subsidiaries in which such
employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and Purchaser shall
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the
date such employee's participation in the

  

       

  

  

corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

  


 _6.2_ _WARN and Corresponding State Laws_. (a) Sellers shall provide to Purchaser no later than five (5) Business Days following the Closing a true and complete list of any and all employment losses (within the meaning of the WARN Act) incurred at any member of the Education Group during the ninety (90) day period prior to Closing, (b) Sellers and their Affiliates shall retain and be solely responsible for any Liability under WARN incurred prior to the Closing Date as a result of the actions of Sellers or their Affiliates or the failure of Sellers or their Affiliates to serve sufficient notice pursuant to WARN, and (c) subject to the truth and accuracy of the information provided to the Purchaser pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for any Liability under WARN on or after the Closing Date as a result of actions by Purchaser and its Affiliates or the failure of Purchaser or its Affiliates to serve sufficient notice pursuant to WARN. 

 _6.3_ _Transfer of Business Employee Plans and Non-US Business Employee Plans_. At or prior to the Closing, Sellers shall (or shall cause their applicable Affiliates to) transfer any Business Employee Plan (and any corresponding Assets and Liabilities) and any Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan (and any corresponding Assets and Liabilities) that is not sponsored or maintained by a member of the Education Group to a member of the Education Group and on and after the Closing, Purchaser shall and shall cause the applicable member(s) of the Education Group to assume and discharge all Liabilities with respect to the Business Employee Plans and the Non-U.S. Business Employee Plans (in each case whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date), and such applicable member(s) of the Education Group shall solely be entitled to the rights of a sponsor and administrator under the Business Employee Plans and the Non-U.S. Business Employee Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that all Liabilities in respect of the CEO RSU Award shall remain Liabilities of Sellers and their applicable Affiliates. 

 _6.4_ _Unused Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. Purchaser shall honor all unused vacation, sick leave and other personal time off (collectively, the " _Transferred Leave_ ") of each Transferred Employee, either by allowing such Transferred Employee to use such accrued vacation or by cashing out such accrued vacation subject to applicable Law, at Purchaser's discretion. Following Closing, the Transferred Employees shall be subject to, and commence to accrue benefits under, the vacation, sick leave and other personal time off policies of Purchaser applicable to the respective Transferred Employee, consistent with _Section 6.1_, subject to the protections regarding Transferred Leave described in the immediately preceding sentence.  

  

 _6.5_ _Workers\' Compensation_. With respect to any Transferred Employee, (a) Sellers and their Affiliates shall be solely responsible for workers' compensation claims or, with respect to jurisdictions outside the United States or Puerto Rico, employers' liability insurance claims, by or with respect to any Transferred Employee that are incurred prior to the Closing Date, and (b) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for workers' compensation claims or, with respect to jurisdictions outside the United States or Puerto Rico, employers' liability insurance claims, by or with respect to any Transferred Employee that are incurred on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section 6.5_, a workers' compensation claim or, with 

  




  

##  

  

       

  

  

respect to jurisdictions outside the United States or Puerto Rico, employers'
liability insurance claims, shall be considered incurred prior to the Closing
Date if the injury or condition giving rise to the claim occurs prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

 _6.6_ _Defined Contribution Pension Plan_. With respect to the 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Savings Plan_ "), Parent shall (a) make all required contributions that relate to periods (whether or not full payroll periods) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (b) cease all contributions on behalf of the Transferred Employees with respect to periods after the Closing Date and (c) on a date mutually agreed between Parent and Purchaser (and in no event later than 120 days after the Closing Date, provided that such time period shall be reasonably extended in the event that such transfer is not feasible within the original time period because of adverse market conditions or other unforeseen circumstances), direct the trustee of the Parent Savings Plan to transfer, in accordance with ERISA and the Code, to the trust corresponding to the defined contribution savings plan established for the benefit of the Transferred Employees (the " _Education Savings Plan_ ") Liability for the account balance (including loans) of each Transferred Employee who is a participant in the Parent Savings Plan (the " _Transferred Savings Plan Participants_ "), together with the corresponding assets, the value of which on such transfer date is equal to the Liability; it being understood that none of Purchaser, the Transferred Companies or any of their respective Affiliates nor the Education Savings Plan shall assume any Liabilities or expenses arising under or relating to the Parent Savings Plan other than the obligation to distribute the transferred account balances in accordance with the Education Savings Plan and applicable Law, which obligation Purchaser hereby expressly assumes. All transfers from the Parent Savings Plan to the Education Savings Plan may be made in installments as mutually agreed by the Parent and Purchaser. All transfers from the Parent Savings Plan to the Education Savings Plan shall, except as Parent and Purchaser mutually agree, be in the form of in kind transfers of assets except where the Education Savings Plan does not have identical investments available or the investment fund does not permit in-kind asset transfers, in which case the transfers of assets will be made in the form of cash. Purchaser shall permit, and shall cause the Education Savings Plan to permit, the transferred account balances of Transferred Savings Plan Participants to include any common stock of Parent that is held in such accounts immediately before such transfer, and to retain such common stock in their accounts under the Education Savings Plan until at least the first anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ that Parent shall not permit, and shall cause the Parent Savings Plan not to permit, Transferred Employees to elect to acquire any additional shares of such common stock in their accounts in the Parent Savings Plan after the Closing Date. Each Transferred Employee who participates in the Parent Savings Plan as of immediately prior to the Closing shall remain an inactive participant in the Parent Savings Plan until the trust-to-trust transfer contemplated by this _Section 6.6_ is completed, and during such time, the account balance for such Transferred Employee shall be credited with applicable earnings or debited with applicable losses and such Transferred Employee shall have the right to withdraw any portion of his or her account balance in accordance with the terms of the Parent Savings Plan.

  

 __

Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume the long-term cash incentive awards described on _Section 6.7_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule granted by Parent to Transferred Employees in 2012 (the " _2012 Cash Performance Awards_ ") and Purchaser shall satisfy the Liabilities thereunder in accordance with the terms of the 2012 Cash Performance Awards. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) the satisfaction of the 

  



  

       

  

performance-based vesting conditions of the 2012 Cash Performance Awards shall
be based on actual performance of Parent in accordance with the terms of the
2012 Cash Performance Awards, (b) the 2012 Cash Performance Awards will be
settled in cash only to the extent the service-based vesting conditions
thereof have been satisfied or as otherwise required by the terms of the
awards, (c) following Closing, Purchaser or the applicable member(s) of the
Education Group shall solely be entitled to the rights of a sponsor and
administrator under the 2012 Cash Performance Awards and (d) any notices sent

regarding such awards shall be subject to the reasonable review, comment and
approval of Purchaser.

On or after January 1, 2013, Parent shall have the right to pay to the Business Employees who participate in an annual bonus or incentive plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates in respect of calendar year 2012 (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include any Business Employee Plan), such Business Employee's 2012 annual bonuses based on actual performance levels as determined in accordance with the terms of Parent's annual bonus plans in effect on the date of this Agreement. If Parent has not paid to the Business Employees the annual bonuses contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence prior to Closing, then, no later than March 15, 2013, Purchaser shall cause to be paid to the Transferred Employees who participate in an annual bonus or incentive plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates in respect of calendar year 2012, such Transferred Employees' 2012 annual bonuses based on actual performance levels as determined in accordance with the terms of Parent's annual bonus plans in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Chief Executive Officer of MH Education as of the date of this Agreement or his designee shall have the right to approve the allocation of the 2012 bonus pool among such Transferred Employees, subject to the prior good faith consultation with the post-Closing Board of Directors of MH Education or its duly designated committee.

  

  

## __

  

 _6.9_ _Treatment of Parent Equity Awards_. Effective upon the Closing, Parent shall cause (a) any unvested restricted shares of Parent common stock (" _Parent Restricted Shares_ ") and any unvested options to purchase shares of Parent common stock (" _Parent Options_ ") held by any Transferred Employee immediately prior to Closing to become fully vested, (b) all Parent Options held by Transferred Employees immediately prior to Closing to remain exercisable until the earlier of (i) the one year anniversary of Closing (or such longer period approved by Parent), and (ii) the expiration of the original term of such option, (c) all units with respect to shares of Parent common stock that are held by Transferred Employees immediately prior to Closing (other than the CEO RSU Award) (the " _Parent RSU Awards_ ") to become vested as of the Closing and payable in accordance with their original payment schedule and (d) Parent and its Affiliates to assume the CEO RSU Award and to satisfy the Liabilities thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof.

## _6.10_ _Withdrawal from Benefit Plans_.

  

### (a) Effective immediately prior to the Closing (or
effective as of the applicable date set forth in _Section 6.6_ ), Sellers
shall cause the Transferred Companies'

  

       

  

  

withdrawal from participation in all Benefit Plans, other than the Business
Employee Plans and the Non-U.S. Business Employee Plans, to the extent any
additional action is needed, in each case, without resulting in any actual or
contingent liability to the Transferred Companies, Purchaser or their
respective Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, all Retained Employee
Liabilities shall be retained by Sellers and its Affiliates.

  



  

### (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Sellers shall, or
shall cause, each Transferred Employee who was participating immediately prior
to the Closing Date in the Parent Savings Plan or the Employee Retirement Plan
of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. and its Subsidiaries to be fully vested in
his or her account and benefit as accrued as of the Closing Date, if and to
the extent not yet fully vested; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Transferred Employee receive any additional service credit for
purposes of these plans.

  

### (c) With respect to each Transferred Employee who, as of
the Closing, is a participant in the Employee Retirement Plan of The McGraw-
Hill Companies, Inc. and its Subsidiaries, and has, as of the Closing Date,
the requisite number of years of service with Sellers and its Affiliates to be
eligible for "early retirement" vesting under such defined benefit plan,
Sellers and its Affiliates shall cause the Transferred Employee to be deemed
eligible for "early retirement" vesting under such defined benefit plan
(including the applicable actuarial factors for such early retirement).

  

### (d) Parent shall cause its United States post-retirement
medical plans and arrangements to provide post-retirement medical benefits to
each Transferred Employee who (i) satisfies the eligibility criteria to
receive benefits under such post-retirement medical plan or arrangement as of
the Closing and (ii) elects such coverage in accordance with applicable plan
terms; _provided_ , that if Parent discontinues its post-retirement medical
plans and arrangements for similarly situated employees of Sellers and their
Affiliates, then the Transferred Employees shall be treated the same as such
employees.

  

 _6.11_ _Supplemental 401(k) Plan_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cause a member of the Education Group to establish a nonqualified supplemental 401(k) plan (the " _MHE Supplemental 401(k) Plan_ ") that is substantially identical to Parent's 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Supplement Plan then in effect (the " _Parent Supplemental 401(k) Plan_ ") and Sellers shall cause the transfer from the Parent Supplemental 401(k) Plan to the MHE Supplemental 401(k) Plan of all outstanding obligations with respect to each Transferred Employee. From and after the Closing, (a) Purchaser shall cause the applicable member of the Education Group to retain the Liabilities for all benefits under the MHE Supplemental 401(k) Plan with respect to Transferred Employees and (b) Purchaser shall cause the applicable member of the Education Group to pay all such benefits under the MHE Supplemental 401(k) Plan in accordance with its terms. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Purchaser, the Transferred Companies or any of their respective Affiliates, nor the MHE Supplemental 401(k) Plan shall assume any Liabilities or expenses arising under or relating to the Parent Supplemental 401(k) Plan other than the obligation to distribute the account balances (and any earnings thereon through the date of distribution) in accordance with the MHE Supplemental 401(k) Plan and applicable Law. Purchaser agrees that it will provide for earnings on account balances under the MHE Supplemental 401(k) Plan on a basis that is substantially as favorable to Transferred Employees as the earnings alternative available to participants in the Parent Supplemental 401(k) Plan.

  

       

  

 _6.12_ _Deferred Compensation Plan_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cause a member of the Education Group to establish a deferred compensation plan (the " _MHE DC Plan_ ") that is substantially identical to Parent's Key Executive Short-Term Incentive Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated as of January 1, 2008 (the " _Parent DC Plan_ ") and Sellers shall cause the transfer from the Parent DC Plan to the MHE DC Plan of all outstanding obligations with respect to each Transferred Employee. From and after the Closing, (a) Purchaser shall cause the applicable member of the Education Group to retain the Liabilities for all benefits under the MHE DC Plan with respect to Transferred Employees and (b) Purchaser shall cause the applicable member of the Education Group to pay all such benefits under the MHE DC Plan in accordance with its terms.

Purchaser agrees that it will provide for earnings on account balances under the MHE DC Plan on a basis that is substantially as favorable to Transferred Employees as the earnings alternative available to participants in the Parent DC Plan.

  

  

## __

Within five Business Days following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall provide to Purchaser a list (the " _Section 6.13 List_ ") that sets forth (a) each individual identified as a Business Employee as of the date of this Agreement who is based in the United States and who shall receive a notice of termination of employment from Sellers prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the restructuring contemplated by Parent as of the date of this Agreement (each such individual, a " _Noticed Business Employee_ ") and (b) such Noticed Business Employee's scheduled employment termination date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Noticed Business Employees shall not constitute Business Employees for any purpose of this Agreement, and each Noticed Business Employee shall remain an employee of Sellers and their Affiliates (other than any member of the Education Group) through such Noticed Business Employee's employment termination date. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers and their Affiliates shall retain all Liabilities arising out of the employment or termination of employment of any Noticed Business Employee; _provided_ , that Purchaser agrees to reimburse Parent promptly (and in no event later than ten Business Days following Purchaser's receipt of an invoice therefor) for the base salary or base wages, as applicable, of any Noticed Business Employee for the period beginning on the first day after the Closing Date through and including the last day of employment for such Noticed Business Employee; _provided_ , _further_ , that the last day of employment for such Noticed Business Employee shall be the earlier of (x) the applicable employment termination date set forth on the Section 6.13 List or (y) such earlier date as may be determined by Purchaser or a member of the Education Group in its sole discretion after Closing, which earlier date pursuant to this clause (y) Purchaser agrees shall not be prior to the expiration of any notice period required by applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, any determination by Purchaser or a member of the Education Group to impose an earlier employment termination date that complies with the requirements of clause (y) of the preceding sentence shall not result in Purchaser or its Affiliates having any Liability with respect to any Noticed Business Employee beyond Purchaser's obligation to reimburse Parent for base salary or base wages pursuant to the preceding sentence. The number of Noticed Business Employees shall not exceed 425.   

  



  

  

       

  


 _6.14_ _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of the Parties and is not intended to confer upon any other Persons (including any current or former employee of Sellers, Purchaser, the Transferred Companies or any of their respective Affiliates) any rights or remedies hereunder, including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period or continued participation in any Business Employee Plan, Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan or other Benefit Plan, or any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Sellers or any of their Affiliates, at any time after the Closing, from amending, merging, modifying, terminating, eliminating, reducing, or otherwise altering in any respect any Benefit Plan, any benefit under any Benefit Plan or any trust, insurance policy or funding vehicle related to any Benefit Plan. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, at any time after the Closing, from amending, merging, modifying, terminating, eliminating, reducing, or otherwise altering in any respect any Business Employee Plan, any benefit under any Business Employee Plan or Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan or any trust, insurance policy or funding vehicle related to any Business Employee Plan or Non-U.S. Business Employee Plan.

any Tax Item by any taxing authority with respect to Taxes for which Parent is

basis") as a result of any Tax Item arising in respect of any payment, loss,
obligation or liability (i) for which Parent has indemnified a Purchaser
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VII_ or _Article X_ , (provided,
however, that Purchaser shall not be required to pay to Parent any amount
pursuant to this clause (i) in excess of the amount of the indemnity payment

contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements actually paid or
reimbursed by Parent or taken into account as a liability or other reduction
in determining the Adjustment Amount, and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing
Date, the members of the Education Group) shall claim any such Tax Item on any
Tax Return for a Post-Closing Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such Tax Item is not permitted by applicable Law to be claimed on a Tax Return
for which Parent has filing responsibility pursuant to _Section 7.5(a)_ and
is permitted by applicable Law to be claimed on a Tax Return for which
Purchaser has filing responsibility pursuant to _Section 7.5(b)_, then,
Purchaser shall claim such Tax Item and pay to Parent the amount of any Tax
Benefit resulting from such Tax Item (net of

Items underlying such refunds or credits were generated in a Post-Closing
Period and carried back to the Pre-Closing Period or to the extent such
refunds or credits were previously included in the calculation of Working
Capital on the Final Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. Purchaser shall be
entitled to any refunds or credits of any member of the Education Group of or
against any Taxes other than refunds or credits to which Parent is entitled
pursuant to the foregoing sentence. Any refunds or credits of or against

the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion
of any correspondence received from the taxing authority.

any Tax Proceeding with respect to any Tax Return described in clause (ii)

_Section 8.1(a) _ shall have denied such grant in a manner that would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.1(a) _ and such
denial shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.1(b)(iii)_ shall have used its reasonable best efforts to obtain such
permit, authorization, consent, approval, expiration or termination to the
extent required by _Section 5.3_;

  

### (c) by Sellers if Purchaser shall have breached or failed
to perform in any material respect any of its respective representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, and

### (d) by Purchaser if Sellers shall have breached or failed to
perform in any material respect any of its respective representations,

cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date or (y) has not been cured prior to
the date that is thirty (30) days from the date that Purchaser or Sellers, as

### (e) by Sellers if: (i) all the conditions set forth in
_Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ have

  

       

  

  

been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, can only be
satisfied or waived at the Closing, but which would be capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination), (ii) Sellers

Closing, and (iii) Purchaser fails to consummate the Closing by the date the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.3_.

## _9.4_ _Reverse Termination Fee and Willful and Material Breach._

  

### (a) If this Agreement is validly terminated: (i) by Sellers
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ and the Debt Financing (or Alternate Financing
in accordance with _Section 5.14(c)_) has not been funded or would not be
available to Purchaser at the Closing or such termination is based on a breach
of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.4_; (ii) by
Purchaser or Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ at a time when all of the
conditions set forth in _Sections 8.1_ and _8.2_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that, by their nature, can only be satisfied or
waived at the Closing, but which would be capable of being satisfied if the
Closing Date were the date of such termination); or (iii) by Sellers pursuant
to _Section 9.1(e)_ (each of (i), (ii) and (iii), a " _Specified
Termination_ "), then in each case of (i), (ii) and (iii), Purchaser shall pay
or cause to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an
account designated by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after the date on
which this Agreement is so terminated the amount of $125,000,000 (the "
_Reverse Termination Fee_ ").

  

### (b) The Parties agree that in lieu of the payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee to Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_ in connection
with a Specified Termination, in the event of a Willful and Material Breach by
Purchaser, Sellers shall be entitled to assert a claim for monetary damages
for such Willful and Material Breach, subject to the limits set forth in
_Section 9.4(d)_ ; _provided _ that in the event that Sellers elect to assert
a claim for Willful and Material Breach by Purchaser, Purchaser shall pay or
cause to be paid to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
to an account designated by Parent, an amount equal to the Reverse Termination
Fee, within five (5) Business Days of the earliest of (i) any of Sellers
obtaining a final and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction finding the existence of a Willful and Material Breach by
Purchaser, (ii) confirmation by Purchaser that it does not intend

  

       

  

  

to contest, defend or appeal, as applicable, such claim, or (iii) the

or filed an appeal. Sellers shall in addition be entitled to pursue all legal
remedies available to it at law to recover from Purchaser all actual monetary
damages incurred by it with respect to such Willful and Material Breach less
the amount previously paid to Sellers in the form of the Reverse Termination
Fee, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.4(d)_. 

  



  

### (c) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 9.4 _ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other Parties would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if any Party fails promptly to
pay the amounts due pursuant to this _Section 9.4 _ (the " _Owing Party_ "),
and, in order to obtain such payments, the other Party commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Owing Party for the amounts set forth in
this _Section 9.4_, the Owing Party will pay to such other Party, from the
date such payment was required to be made, the Interest Rate on the amounts
set forth in this _Section 9.4_. The Parties acknowledge that the Reverse
Termination Fee shall not constitute a penalty but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Sellers in the circumstances in which
the Reverse Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Sale, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The Parties
acknowledge that the right of Sellers to receive the Reverse Termination Fee
shall not limit or otherwise affect Sellers' right to specific performance as
provided in _Section 11.11_.

  

### (d) Except in the case of any fraud or any Willful and
Material Breach, in any circumstance in which Parent effects a Specified
Termination and receives the Reverse Termination Fee in full pursuant to
_Section 9.4(a)_ , Parent's termination of this Agreement and receipt of the
Reverse Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
its Affiliates against the Purchaser Related Parties for any Losses suffered
as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation contained in this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby, the failure of the Closing to be consummated, the Guaranty or the
Financing, and upon such Specified Termination and receipt of the Reverse
Termination Fee, none of the Purchaser Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation, including consequential, indirect or punitive
damages, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Guaranty, the Financing, or in respect of any other
agreement, document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise
(except that the applicable Purchaser Related Parties (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing Sources) and Seller Related Parties
shall remain obligated for, and Sellers, Purchaser and their respective
Affiliates may be entitled to remedies with respect to, any breach of the
Confidentiality Agreement or the provisions surviving such termination
pursuant to _Section 9.3_ ). The maximum aggregate monetary liability of
Purchaser and the Guarantors for any loss suffered as a result of any breach
of this Agreement, the Guaranty or the Commitment Letters (including any
Willful and Material Breach), or the failure of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation
made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether
in equity or at Law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, shall be limited to
(i)

  

       

  

  

the Reverse Termination Fee in accordance with the preceding sentence or (ii)
solely in the event of a Willful and Material Breach, an amount equal to
$300,000,000 (inclusive of any payment of the Reverse Termination Fee), in
either case plus any payment obligations pursuant to _Section 5.14(d)_ in the
aggregate, and in no event shall any Seller seek to recover any money damages
(including consequential, indirect or punitive damages) in excess of such
amount. The maximum aggregate monetary liability of Sellers for any loss
suffered or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have
been made in connection herewith, whether in equity or at Law, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, shall be limited in the event of a Willful and Material
Breach to an amount equal to $300,000,000 (inclusive of any payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee), and in no event shall any Seller seek to recover any
money damages (including consequential, indirect or punitive damages) in
excess of such amount. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section
9.4(d)_ shall limit any remedies of Purchaser, Parent and Sellers prior to
termination of this Agreement for specific performance under _Section 11.11_.

  



  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.4_ to the
contrary, no Purchaser Related Party, except Purchaser and the Guarantors (but
only to the extent set forth in the Guaranty), and no Seller Related Party,
except Sellers, shall have any liability for any obligation or liability of
the Parties or for any claim for any loss suffered as a result of any breach
of this Agreement, the Guaranty or the Commitment Letters (including any
Willful and Material Breach), or the failure of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation
made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether
in equity or at Law, in contract, in tort or otherwise. 

  


 _9.5_ _Extension Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, either Sellers or Purchaser may (a) extend the time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other Party contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party granting such extension or waiver.

Party has determined gives or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a
right of indemnification under such agreement (including a pending or
threatened claim or demand asserted by a third Party against the Indemnified
Party, such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances (then known) with respect to the subject
matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its

### (b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section
10.3(a)_ , the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the
Indemnified Party delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of
notice of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such
Third Party Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided_ that
the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its
own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the defense and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section
10.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such
defense, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense and control of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of
recognized standing and competence and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts in the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim. Purchaser or
Sellers, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates
and representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books and
records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of
a Third Party Claim, it shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ that
such settlement or judgment does not involve any injunctive relief binding on
any of the Indemnified Parties or finding or admission of any violation of Law
or admission of any liability or wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts in such
settlement or judgment (other than solely with respect to the Deductible, to
the extent such liabilities would constitute Losses to which the Deductible
would be applicable in accordance with the applicable provisions of _Section
10.2(b)_), (ii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other resolution,
a complete and unconditional release of any Indemnified Party potentially
affected by such Third Party Claim. No Indemnified Party will consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect
to a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  


 _10.5_ _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Except with respect to the matters covered by _Section 2.4_ and with respect to any matter relating to Taxes, Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of _Sections 10.2_ and _10.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Sellers and Purchaser, respectively, and their respective Affiliates, including the members of the Education Group, for any Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that each Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with the Sale, including any breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement by any Party, or any failure by any Party to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. 

  

## _10.6_ _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to
each indemnification obligation contained in this Article X, all Losses shall
be net of any third-party insurance and

  

       

  

  

indemnity proceeds that are recoverable by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification in each case net of
any deductible or copayment, the costs of filing a claim, arbitration costs,
the Indemnified Party's actual increase in applicable insurance or other
premiums attributable to such recovery and all other out-of-pocket costs
related to such recovery (it being agreed that if third-party insurance or
indemnification proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered by the
Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Party's making of an
indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification
obligation, such proceeds shall be remitted to the Indemnifying Party to the
extent of the indemnification payment made). The Indemnified Party shall use,
and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to seek
recovery under all insurance and indemnity provisions covering any Losses for
which it is seeking indemnification hereunder to the same extent as it would
if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. Upon making any
payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to
this _Article X_, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent
of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against
any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights
to the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

## _10.7_ _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any
Indemnifying Party have liability to any Indemnified Party for any
consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive damages.

  

## _10.8_ _Mitigation_. Each of the Parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and
after becoming aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

  

## _10.9_ _Effect of Knowledge_. The right to indemnification, payment
of Losses or other remedies based on any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to
or any knowledge or information acquired at this time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement (other than disclosures made in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and Purchaser Disclosure Schedule hereto). The waiver of
any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty or on
the performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement, will not
affect the right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy based
on such representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

are or are

  

       

  

  

not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts
or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule in any dispute or controversy
between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
in this Agreement or included in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
and if an ambiguity or question of interpretation should arise, this Agreement

this Agreement, including any Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or

will not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

## _11.3_ _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury

### (a) This Agreement and any claim or controversy arising out
of or relating to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by
and interpreted and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed and to be

  

       

  

  

performed wholly within the State of Delaware and without reference to the
choice-of-law principles or rules of conflict of laws that would result in,
require or permit the application of the Laws of a different jurisdiction or
direct a matter to another jurisdiction.

  



  

### (b) Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to
the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, solely

hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of
such Action may be heard and determined in such court. Each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent that it may
effectively do so, any defense of an inconvenient forum which such Party may
now or hereafter have to the maintenance of such Action. The Parties further
agree, (i) to the extent permitted by Law, that final and unappealable
judgment against any of them in any Action contemplated above shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the
United States by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be

service of process upon such Party in any such action or proceeding shall be
effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section 11.7_.

IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE
OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY OTHER
AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR
ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN, INCLUDING ANY ACTION
RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR INVOLVING ANY
DEBT FINANCING SOURCE. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN
ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED
UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS (INCLUDING
THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTERS) OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES. NO
PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN
WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN
WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS _SECTION 11.3_. NO PARTY

York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction vested in the federal
courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York

 _11.4_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Ancillary Agreements and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes any prior discussion, correspondence, negotiation, proposed term sheet, agreement, understanding or arrangement, and there are no terms, conditions, agreements, understandings, representations or warranties between the Parties other than those set forth or referred to in this Agreement. 

 _11.5_ _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except for _Section 5.13_, _Section 10.2 _ and _Section 10.3(a)_ , which are intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the Parties specified therein, this Agreement, together with the Ancillary Agreements and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto is not intended to confer, or shall be construed to confer, in or on behalf of any Person not a party to this Agreement (and their successors and assigns) any legal or equitable rights, benefits, claims, causes of action or remedies with respect to the subject matter or any provision hereof; except that the Debt Financing Sources shall be third party beneficiaries of the provisions of _Sections 9.3_ , _9.4_ , _11.3 _ and _11.11 _ and this _Section 11.5 _ applicable to such Persons.

## _11.8_ _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon, enforceable against and inure to the benefit of the Parties to this
Agreement and their respective permitted

  

       

  

  

successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party to this
Agreement may directly or indirectly assign any or all of its rights or
delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement without the
express prior written consent of each other Party to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that either Party may assign its rights under this
Agreement to any of its Affiliates (so long as they remain Affiliates) or as
collateral to any lender (or agent or trustee therefor) in connection with any
bona fide financing arrangement, including in the case of Purchaser, the Debt
Financing. 

 _11.9_ _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought. Either Party to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in writing, waive compliance by the other Party to this Agreement with any term or provision of this Agreement on the part of such other Party to this Agreement to be performed or complied with. Any waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described therein and shall in no way impair the rights of the Party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. The waiver by any of the Parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall not be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature or as a waiver of any such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. 

 _11.10_ _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

 _11.11_ _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction. The foregoing is in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law, in equity or otherwise. The Parties further agree that nothing set forth in this _Section 11.11 _ shall require any party hereto to institute any Action for (or limit any party's right to institute any Action for) specific performance under this _Section 11.11 _ prior 

  

##  

  

       

  

  

or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article IX _
(and pursuing damages after such termination). The Parties hereto agree that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall be entitled to
specific performance (or any other equitable relief) to cause Purchaser to
draw down the Equity Financing under the Equity Commitment Letters and to
cause Purchaser to effect the Closing on the terms and subject to the
conditions in this Agreement, only if: (i) all conditions in _Sections 8.1_
and _8.2 _ have been satisfied as of the date on which the Closing would
otherwise be required to occur (other than those conditions that, by their
nature, can only be satisfied at the Closing (provided such conditions would
have been satisfied as of such date); (ii) Purchaser fails to complete the
Closing by the date the Closing would otherwise be required to have occurred
pursuant to _Section 2.3_; (iii) the Debt Financing (or Alternate Financing
in accordance with _Section 5.14_) has been funded, or would be funded to
Purchaser at the Closing, if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing (
_provided _ that Purchaser shall not be required to draw down the Equity
Financing or to consummate the Closing if the Debt Financing is not in fact
funded at the Closing); (iv) the Closing will occur substantially
simultaneously with the drawdown of the Debt Financing (or Alternate Financing
in accordance with _Section 5.14_); and (v) Sellers have irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Purchaser that Sellers are prepared to and able to
effect the Closing upon funding of the Equity Financing and Debt Financing.

  


 _11.12_ _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, in any Action or proceeding involving a third party, that such third party is or is not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the performance or observance of any term or provisions of any contract. 

 _11.13_ _Agency_. Each Seller hereby grants Parent the power to take any action on behalf of all Sellers and to act as the agent for, and on behalf of, all Sellers regarding any matter relating to or under this Agreement and Purchaser agrees that any action that may be taken by Sellers may be taken by Parent on behalf of all Sellers.

  

 _11.14_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by either of the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
