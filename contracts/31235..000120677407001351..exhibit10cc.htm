To the extent that any such Transferred Asset cannot be transferred or the full rights and benefits of use of any such Transferred Asset cannot be provided to Buyer following the Closing despite Sellers use of commercially reasonable efforts in accordance with this Section 2.10, then Buyer and Seller shall enter into such arrangements (including subleasing or subcontracting if permitted) to provide to Buyer the economic and operational 

   equivalents, to the extent permitted, and designed to provide Buyer with the
rights and benefits (including enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of any and
all rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates against any other party arising
out of such Transferred Asset and, if requested by Buyer, acting as an agent
on behalf of Buyer or as Buyer shall otherwise reasonably require, at Buyers
expense) of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver and the
performance by Buyer of the obligations thereunder and Buyer shall direct the
operations of such Transferred Assets. With respect to the provisions of this
Section 2.10, Seller shall pay promptly to Buyer, when received, all income,
proceeds and other monies (other than the Initial Purchase Price) received by
Seller or any of its Affiliates to the extent related to any Transferred Asset
(net of any Taxes (and any other costs) imposed upon Seller or any Subsidiary
in connection with the arrangements under this Section 2.10), with such Tax
costs to be determined by assuming that such Transferred Assets and related
operations were taxable on a stand-alone basis). If the Taxes (as so
determined) and other costs imposed upon Seller or any Subsidiary in respect
of such Transferred Asset exceed the monies received by Seller or any
Subsidiary in respect thereof, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller or the
applicable Subsidiary for such excess. To the extent permitted under
applicable Tax law, for all Tax purposes the parties shall treat all such
assets as having been transferred by Seller to Buyer at the Closing.

  

 Section 2.11 _Obtaining Consents and Approvals_. In the event that any payment of money or other consideration is required in connection with obtaining any of the consents, approvals, waivers or authorizations contemplated by Section 2.10, and Buyer determines that any such payment should be made, Buyer and Seller shall each pay 50% of such payment; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to pay more than $2,500,000, respectively, in the aggregate to obtain such consents, approvals, waivers or authorizations.

  

 Section 2.12 _Intellectual Property Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at and following the Closing, Buyers and the Transferred Subsidiaries right, title and interest in and to the Transferred Intellectual Property and Transferred Subsidiary Intellectual Property shall be subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the Ancillary Agreements, including the Intellectual Property Agreement. Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall limit the representations and warranties of Seller in Article III or Sellers obligations under Article VII.

  

 Section 2.13 _IRR Payment_. 

  

 (a) If the Closing has occurred and on the terms set forth in this Agreement, in addition to the Initial Purchase Price payable at the Closing in accordance with Section 2.5(a), upon the occurrence of each IRR Payment Event, the IRR Payment, if any, resulting from such IRR Payment Event shall be paid to Seller in accordance with Section 2.13(b), _provided that_ any IRR Payment otherwise required hereunder shall be reduced to the extent necessary so that the aggregate IRR Payments made hereunder do 

   not exceed $200,000,000, and the obligation to make any IRR Payment hereunder
shall cease and terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) such time as the
aggregate IRR Payments made to Seller hereunder equal $200,000,000 and (ii)
such time as (A) the Investors cease to hold any Investors Equity Interests or
any property or securities other than cash or Readily Marketable Securities
received by the Investors with respect to, or as consideration or in exchange
for, Investors Equity Interests (such property or securities, the "Non-
Marketable Property") and (B) all IRR Payments, if any, required to be paid
hereunder in connection with the IRR Payment Event, if any, arising from the
Investors ceasing to hold any Investors Equity Interests or such property or
securities have been paid in full (the earlier to occur of such events, the "
_Termination Event_ ").

  

 (b) Subject to any adjustments that may be made in accordance with Section 2.13(c), contemporaneously with the receipt by the Investors of any Cash Inflow on any IRR Payment Event, Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller (for the benefit of itself and its Affiliates in accordance with Section 2.5(b)) its good faith estimate of the IRR Payment (the " _Estimated IRR Payment_ "), if any, by wire transfer of immediately available funds and, to the extent that the Cash Inflow from which it results consists of any Readily Marketable Securities, by transfer of Readily Marketable Securities. The percentage of any IRR Payment that is made in the form of Readily Marketable Securities shall be the same as the percentage of the Cash Inflow in the IRR Payment Event from which such IRR Payment results that consists of Readily Marketable Securities, and the portion of any IRR Payment that consists of Readily Marketable Securities shall be valued at the Fair Market Value thereof as of the date of the related IRR Payment Event.

  

 (c) (i) No later than 10 days following the receipt by the Investors of any Cash Inflow or the receipt by the Company of any Cash Outflow, (A) in the case of a Cash Inflow, Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Seller a statement that notifies Seller of such Cash Inflow (if not previously so notified) and sets forth in reasonable detail its calculation of IRR and IRR Payment, if any, as of the date of such receipt (an " _IRR Statement_ "), and (B) in the case of a Cash Outflow, Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Seller a statement that notifies Seller of such Cash Outflow and sets forth in reasonable detail its calculation of the Fair Market Value of any Non-Marketable Property included in such Cash Outflow as of the date of receipt by the Company of such Non-Marketable Property (an " _FMV Statement_ ").

  

 (ii) In the case of a Cash Inflow, if Seller disagrees with the determination of IRR or IRR Payment, if any, in such IRR Statement, Seller may, within 30 days after receipt of such IRR Statement, deliver a notice (an " _IRR_ _Objection Notice_ ") to Buyer setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of IRR and IRR Payment. 

  

 (iii) In the case of a Cash Outflow, if Seller disagrees with the determination of Fair Market Value in such FMV Statement, Seller may, within 30 days after receipt of such FMV Statement, deliver a notice (an " _FMV Objection Notice_ ") to Buyer __ setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of Fair Market Value. __

   (iv) If Seller does not deliver an IRR Objection Notice or FMV Objection Notice to Buyer within 30 days after receipt of the IRR Statement or the FMV Statement, respectively, then Seller and Buyer will be deemed to have agreed to the IRR Statement or the FMV Statement, respectively, and such determinations shall be deemed to be finally determined as set forth therein. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements as to the computation of IRR, IRR Payment or Fair Market Value, as the case may be, but if they do not obtain a final resolution within 15 days after Buyer has received an IRR Objection Notice or FMV Objection Notice, as the case may be, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain the New York City office of an independent "Big Four" accounting firm reasonably acceptable to both Seller and Buyer (the " _Firm_ ") to resolve any remaining disagreements. Buyer and Seller shall direct the Firm to render a determination within 15 days of its engagement, and Buyer and Seller and their respective Affiliates and representatives shall cooperate with the Firm during the terms of its engagement. The Firm will be directed to consider only those items and amounts in the IRR Statement or the FMV Statement, as the case may be, set forth in the IRR Objection Notice or the FMV Objection Notice, as the case may be, which Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve. Buyer and Seller shall each make a submission to the Firm promptly (and in any event within 10 days after the Firms engagement), which submission shall contain such partys determination of IRR, IRR Payment or Fair Market Value, as the case may be, and all relevant information, arguments, and support for such partys position. The Firm shall review such submissions and base its determination solely on them. In resolving any disputed item, the Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Firms determination will be based on the definition of IRR, IRR Payment or Fair Market Value, as the case may be, included herein. The determination of the Firm will be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Seller. Seller and Buyer shall each bear 50% of the costs and expenses of the Firm. 

  

 (v) The IRR Payment, if any, as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.13(c) shall be referred to herein as the " _Actual IRR Payment_." If any Estimated IRR Payment is made as of an IRR Payment Event pursuant to Section 2.13(b), and such Estimated IRR Payment is less than the Actual IRR Payment as of such IRR Payment Event, then Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller (for the benefit of itself and its Affiliates in accordance with Section 2.5(b)) an amount equal to such shortfall, plus interest calculated at the bond rate for AA corporate bonds with a maturity of one year, or, if a rate is not available for that maturity, for the closest maturity for which such a rate is available (the " _AA Rate_ ") for bonds most similar to such bonds) prevailing as of the date of such payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds and, to 

   the extent that the Cash Inflow from which such IRR Payment results consists
of any Readily Marketable Securities, by transfer of Readily Marketable
Securities. If any Estimated IRR Payment is made as of an IRR Payment Event
pursuant to Section 2.13(b), and such Estimated IRR Payment is greater than
the Actual IRR Payment as of such IRR Payment Event, then Seller shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to Buyer an amount equal to such excess plus interest
calculated at the AA Rate prevailing as of the date of such payment by wire
transfer of immediately available funds and, to the extent that the Cash
Inflow from which such IRR Payment results consists of any Readily Marketable
Securities, by transfer of Readily Marketable Securities. The percentage of
any Readily Marketable Securities to be included in any such payment, if
applicable, shall be determined in accordance with the last sentence of
Section 2.13(b).

  

 (d) Buyer hereby covenants that during the period commencing on the Closing Date and expiring on the occurrence of the Termination Event: 

  

 (i) Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to enter into any agreement that would, by its terms, or should reasonably be expected to, prohibit or restrict the payment of any IRR Payment required by this Section 2.13, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries may enter into or become subject to agreements that restrict the making of payments which, if made, would directly or indirectly constitute, create or result in, Cash Inflows;

  

 (ii) without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any transaction with any of the Investors, other than (A) such transactions pursuant to which Cash Inflows or Cash Outflows are made, including the entry of any management agreement or similar agreement providing for fees all of which would constitute Cash Inflows and any subscription agreement, purchase agreement or similar agreement that would result in Cash Outflows or (B) the entry of any shareholders agreement, registration rights agreement, voting agreement or other agreement related to the rights or obligations related to the Investors Equity Interests and which do not involve any Cash Inflows or Cash Outflows or any other payments by Buyer or its Subsidiaries to any Investor; and 

  

 (iii) Buyer shall not take any action for the purpose of frustrating the intent of the parties, as reflected in this Section 2.13, that if the Investors realize a "cash-on-cash" IRR in excess of 25% on their investment in Buyer, Seller will receive IRR Payments equal to 25% of the excess return, but not exceeding $200,000,000 in the aggregate. The parties intend that this Section 2.13 shall be interpreted by the parties, any Firm, and any Governmental Entity to give maximum effect to the intent of the parties, as reflected in this Section 2.13, that if the Investors realize a "cash-on-cash" IRR in excess of 25% of their investment in Buyer, Seller will receive IRR Payments equal to 25% of the excess return, but not exceeding $200,000,000 in the aggregate. 

   (e) The right of Seller to receive any IRR Payment hereunder is solely a contractual right and is not a security for purposes of any federal or state securities laws, and Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the obligations of the Company under this Section 2.13 shall confer upon Seller only the rights of a general unsecured creditor under applicable state law. 

  

 (f) For purposes of this Section 2.13:

  

 " _Cash Inflow_ " means the sum of: 

  

 (i) cash payments actually received by the Investors from the Company or an Independent Third Party with respect to, or as consideration or in exchange for, Investors Equity Interests, including, without duplication, all cash payments actually received by the Investors with respect to, or as consideration or in exchange for, any property (other than Readily Marketable Securities) received by the Investors with respect to, or as consideration or in exchange for, Investors Equity Interests and all cash dividends or other cash distributions received with respect to Investors Equity Interests, net of documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses payable or paid to Independent Third Parties incurred by the Investors in connection with the transactions in which such cash payments are received; and 

  

 (ii) the Fair Market Value (determined as of date on which Readily Marketable Securities are actually received by the Investors) of all Readily Marketable Securities actually received by the Investors from an Independent Third Party as consideration or in exchange for Investors Equity Interests, or as consideration or in exchange for, any property (other than Investors Equity Interests or Readily Marketable Securities) received by the Investors with respect to, or as consideration or in exchange for, Investors Equity Interests, but excluding any Readily Marketable Securities of the Company received by the Investors by way of dividend, distribution or any subdivision or combination with respect to or of Investors Equity Interests, net of documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses payable or paid to Independent Third Parties incurred by the Investors in connection with the transactions in which such property or Readily Marketable Securities are received. 

  

In addition, all transaction, advisory, consulting, management and similar
fees paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Investors, in any
capacity, shall be treated as Cash Inflows.

  

 " _Cash Outflows_ " means the aggregate amount of cash payments made, and the Fair Market Value of property contributed, by the Investors to the Company or an Independent Third Party to purchase or otherwise in exchange for Investors Equity Interests, including, but not limited to, the investment made by the Investors to acquire Investors Equity Interests in connection with the Closing.

   " _Company_ " means (i) either Buyer or a Person holding 100% of the outstanding equity securities of Buyer, (ii) any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Buyer that acquired capital stock of the Transferred Subsidiaries and Transferred Assets pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) any successor to such a Person by reason of a merger, consolidation or other business combination.

  

 " _Excess Cash Inflows_ " means, with respect to an IRR Payment Event, an amount equal to the amount by which the Cash Inflow in such IRR Payment Event could be reduced (but not below 0) without resulting in an IRR as of the date of such Cash Inflow of 25% or less.

  

 " _Fair Market Value_ " means: (i) with respect to any Readily Marketable Securities, as of any date, the officially quoted closing price of such securities on the stock exchange or automatic quotations systems on which such securities are listed; and (ii) with respect to Non-Marketable Property, as of such date on which any Cash Outflows are received by the Company or an Independent Third Party in the form of Non-Marketable Property, the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an arms length transaction, as determined in accordance with Section 2.13(c). 

  

 " _Independent Third Party_ " means any Person who, immediately prior to the contemplated transaction, is not an Investor or a Person within the definition of the Company.

 " _Investors Equity Interests_ " means all capital stock or other equity securities of the Company held by the Investors as of the Closing and at any time thereafter, including any capital stock or other equity securities of the Company issued to Investors directly or indirectly with respect to Investors Equity Interests by way of dividend, distribution or any subdivision or combination, but excluding any Readily Marketable Securities taken into account pursuant to clause (ii) of the definition of Cash Inflows. 

  

 " _IRR_ " means the annual interest rate (compounded annually), if any, which, when used to calculate the net present value as of the Closing Date of all Cash Inflows and all Cash Outflows through the date of determination, causes such net present value of all Cash Inflows to equal such net present value of all Cash Outflows.

  

 " _IRR Payment_ " means, with respect to any IRR Payment Event, an amount equal to 25% of the Excess Cash Inflow in such IRR Payment Event.

   An " _IRR Payment Event_ " occurs if an IRR in excess of 25% is achieved immediately after giving effect to any Cash Inflow. 

  

 " _Readily Marketable Securities_ " means readily marketable securities listed or quoted on a U.S. national stock exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market or a major international stock exchange or automatic quotation system. 

  

 Section 2.14 _Deferred Closings_.

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI have been satisfied (or waived in writing) with respect to all of the countries in which the Transferred Assets are physically located or from which the Business derived revenues in 2005, other than one or more countries which in the aggregate contributed less than ten (10) percent of the Business 2005 revenues (the " _Deferred Closing Countries_ "), based on the allocation of the Business 2005 revenues set forth on Schedule 2.14, the Closing shall be effected, including the payment of the Initial Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that the evidence to be delivered in connection with the Closing pursuant to Article VI shall be required only with respect to all of such countries, other than the Deferred Closing Countries. One or more subsequent closings (" _Deferred Closings_ ") shall occur as soon as practicable following the receipt of all of the evidence to be delivered, with respect to each such Deferred Closing Country. Until such time as a Deferred Closing occurs with respect to a Deferred Closing Country, Seller shall, with any necessary cooperation from Buyer, operate the portion of the Business located in such Deferred Closing Country in trust for the account of Buyer in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. In connection therewith, (i) Buyer and Seller shall net out the costs and benefits associated with the portion of the Business in each such Deferred Closing Country for the period between the Closing Date and the date of the Deferred Closing for such Deferred Closing Country on the date of the Deferred Closing for such Deferred Closing Country, (ii) all assets that would be Transferred Assets, but for the failure to receive the evidence to be delivered in connection with the Closing, shall be regarded as Transferred Assets for purposes of the calculations required under Section 2.5(b), (iii) the Assumed Liabilities relating to such Deferred Closing Country shall be deemed to have been assumed as of the Closing for purposes of Section 2.5(b) and (iv) the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly the remaining evidence to be delivered to effectuate a Deferred Closing with respect to such Deferred Closing Country. To the extent that Buyer is required to pay any cash consideration for the Transferred Assets located in any Deferred Closing Countries at a Deferred Closing, Seller shall remit to Buyer, in immediately available funds, the amount of cash consideration allocated to such Deferred Closing Country in accordance with Section 5.4(k), and Buyer shall pay such consideration at such Deferred Closing. 

  

 (b) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts between the date hereof and Closing to develop and implement provisional arrangements for each potential Deferred Closing Country, including engaging in the activities set forth in Section 5.22. 

   (c) In the event that a Deferred Closing does not occur with respect any Deferred Closing Country within 180 days after the Closing Date (the " _Deferred Closing Deadline_"), either Buyer or Seller may give notice to the other of its election to terminate the arrangements set forth in this Section 2.14 with respect to such Deferred Closing Country; if such notice is given, (i) within five (5) Business Days after such notice, Seller shall pay to Buyer such portion of the Initial Purchase Price allocable to the Business conducted at such Deferred Closing Country, as set forth on Schedule 5.4, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the rate of interest borne by Buyer and its Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries under the senior debt included in the Debt Financing, (ii) the temporary arrangements entered into prior to the Deferred Closing Deadline pursuant to Section 2.14(a) in respect of such Deferred Closing Country shall cease as of such time the payment contemplated in clause (i) immediately foregoing is made to Buyer and (iii) at Sellers request, subject to Section 5.13, Seller and Buyer shall enter into mutually agreeable, commercially reasonable arrangements to allow Seller to continue to conduct the Business in such Deferred Closing Country. However, a party that has breached in any material respect any of its covenants under this Agreement in any manner that proximately contributed to the failure of a Deferred Closing to occur prior to the Deferred Closing Deadline with respect to a Deferred Closing Country may not give a notice pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence with respect to such Deferred Closing Country.

   Section 3.2 _Subsidiaries_. 

  

 (a) Schedule 3.2(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of each Transferred Subsidiary, including the Newco Entities, together with its jurisdiction of organization and its authorized and outstanding capital stock or other equity interests as of the date hereof.

The outstanding stock and other equity interests of the Transferred Subsidiaries are not subject to any voting trust agreement or other contract, agreement or arrangement restricting or otherwise relating to the voting, dividend rights or disposition of such stock or other equity interests. There are no phantom stock or similar rights providing economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of the stock or other equity interests of the Transferred Subsidiaries.

 Section 3.4 _Consents and Approvals_. (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.4(a), to the Knowledge of Seller, no consent, approval, waiver, authorization, notice or filing is required to be obtained by Seller or any of its Affiliates from, or to be given by Seller or any of its Affiliates to, or made by Seller or any of its Affiliates with, any Government Entity or Self-Regulatory Organization, in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by Seller or any of its Affiliates of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

benefits to be provided under such plan or in respect of Transferred Employees

 (a) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill as promptly as practicable the conditions precedent to the other partys obligations hereunder, including securing as promptly as practicable all consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to Section 2.11, neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to pay any money or to pay or agree to any other consideration or condition in connection with obtaining the consent, approval, waiver or authorization of any Person that is not a Governmental Entity. To the extent that, as an accommodation to Buyer and with Buyers prior written consent, Seller incurs costs that Buyer otherwise would have to incur in order to secure any authorization, consent, waiver, license or approval, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any such costs that are invoiced by Seller to Buyer. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to separate, to the extent reasonably practicable, prior to the Closing the Business Books and Records from those Books and Records that relate to any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or relate to any business of Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the Business. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be deemed to use "commercially reasonable efforts" for purposes of the prior sentence if Seller engages in the separation activities set forth on Schedule 5.3(b). 

  

 (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Seller will make all filings and submissions required by U.S. Antitrust Laws and for the purpose of obtaining the Non-U.S. Merger Clearances as soon as practicable after the date of signing of this Agreement or, if applicable, after determination by the parties, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter and promptly file any additional information requested as soon as practicable after receipt of such request therefor and promptly file any other information that is necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the Transaction. Buyer shall pay the filing fee under the HSR Act. 

  

 (d) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and shall furnish to the other party all information necessary or desirable in connection with making any filing under the HSR Act and for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to U.S. Antitrust Laws and in connection with the Non-U.S. Merger Clearances and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry by any Governmental Entity under any competition Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (all such filings, the " _Antitrust Filings_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any such information consists of confidential information or business secrets, the party otherwise required to furnish such confidential information or business secrets in accordance with the sentence immediately foregoing may withhold it and notify 

   the other party of the existence of such confidential information or business
secrets, describing in reasonable detail the reason such confidential
information or business secrets are treated as such, and, to the extent that
the other party reasonably determines that such confidential information or
business secrets, or any portion thereof, must be furnished to such other
party because they will be required by such other party in connection with
making the Antitrust Filings (the extent of such confidential information or
business secrets, the " _Reasonably Required Confidential Information_ "), the
furnishing party shall be required to furnish only such Reasonably Required
Confidential Information to the other partys outside antitrust counsel, but
only if such outside antitrust counsel enters into an agreement reasonably
satisfactory to the furnishing party to keep such Reasonably Required
Confidential Information confidential, not to disclose it to any person
(including its client and its clients transactional counsel (even if within
the same law firm as antitrust counsel)) and to use such Reasonably Required
Confidential Information solely in connection with the Antitrust Filings. Each
of the parties shall promptly inform the other party of any communication
with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Entity regarding any such filings or any such transaction.
Neither Seller nor Buyer shall participate in any meeting or substantive
conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of
and reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting or substantive
conversation unless such Governmental Entity objects, provided, however that
if a Governmental Entity objects to the other partys participation in the
meeting or substantive conversation, the party that does participate in the
meeting or substantive conversation shall inform the other party that such a
meeting or conversation took place and provide a summary of such meeting or
conversation. The parties will consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act, the Non-U.S. Merger Clearances or other competition
Laws (including, with respect to making a particular filing, by providing
copies of all such documents (which may be redacted to exclude confidential
information and business secrets) to the non-filing party and their advisors
prior to filing and, if requested, giving due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith).

  

 (e) During the period from the date hereof to the Closing Date, Buyer agrees not to enter into, or permit any of its Affiliates (excluding any Affiliate, other than Onex Corporation, that has outstanding publicly-traded equity securities and the Subsidiaries of such Affiliates) to enter into, any transaction, or any contract to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition), that would cause the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.11 not to be true and correct assuming such representation and warranty is read without giving effect to the words "As of the date hereof," contained therein. 

  

 (f) In the event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates enters into any transaction, or any contract to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) 

   (i) before the date of this Agreement that causes the representation and
warranty contained in Section 4.11 to be inaccurate (assuming such
representation and warranty is read without giving effect to the words "to the
Knowledge of Buyer" contained therein) or (ii) between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing that would cause the representation and warranty
contained in Section 4.11 to be inaccurate (assuming that such representation
and warranty were made on the date of such contract or transaction and is read
without giving effect to the words "to the Knowledge of Buyer" contained
therein), and in either case entry into such transaction or contract
materially delays or prevents the consummation of the Transaction under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation or law, Buyer agrees to, and to
cause all of its Affiliates (excluding any Affiliate that controls Onex
Corporation and any Affiliate, other than Onex Corporation, that
has outstanding publicly-traded equity securities and the Subsidiaries of
such Affiliates) to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation
Law that may be asserted as a result of such breach, so as to enable the
parties hereto to close the Transaction as promptly as possible, including
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of
its or its Affiliates (excluding any Affiliate that controls Onex Corporation
and any Affiliate, other than Onex Corporation, that has outstanding publicly-
traded equity securities and the Subsidiaries of such Affiliates) assets,
properties or businesses or of the Transferred Assets to be acquired by it
pursuant hereto, and the entry into such other arrangements, as are necessary
or reasonably advisable in order to avoid the entry of and the commencement of
litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order or decision in any suit
or proceeding, in each case, except as would (i) individually or in the
aggregate result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the
benefits of the Transaction to be realized by Buyer or (ii) require Buyer to
hold separate a material portion of the Business. In addition, Buyer shall use
its reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from occurring as promptly as
practicable.

Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transaction Transfer Taxes and Reimbursable Value Added Taxes shall be prepared and filed by the party primarily or customarily responsible under applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns (the " _Filing Party_ "), and such party will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party at least 10 Business Days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the allocation of Consideration pursuant to Section 5.4(k) hereof.

  

 (iv) _Payments Due With Tax Returns_. The Filing Party shall promptly pay all Transfer Taxes due with respect to Tax Returns to be filed by such party under this Section 5.4(f); and the parties shall cooperate to insure all Transaction Transfer Taxes, Reimbursable Value Added Taxes (including any Seller VAT Payment) and any refunds and Recoupments of such amounts shall be borne by and given over to the appropriate party in accordance with Section 5.4(f)(ii). Any Transfer Taxes resulting from any subsequent increase in Consideration shall be borne in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.4(f) and any Tax Returns required to be filed in connection therewith shall be prepared and filed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.4(f). 

   (v) _Cooperation With Respect to Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate diligently and in good faith (A) to identify and agree upon the Transaction Transfer Taxes and Reimbursable Value Added Taxes, (B) in promptly seeking all applicable waivers and/or exemptions to any Transfer Taxes (including any going concern, bulk sale or similar exemptions), (C) in timely completing and filing all Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, (D) if the Seller VAT Amount is greater than zero, in determining the amount due to Seller under Section 5.4(f)(ii)(B) and seeing to it that the provisions of Section 5.4(f)(ii)(B) operate in the manner intended by the parties, and (E) to execute, acknowledge and deliver any instruments, or enter into any arrangements as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the foregoing (including, but not limited to complying with all relevant procedural requirements or other formalities of any relevant jurisdiction (including, if required, VAT registering entities and opting any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property to VAT in the relevant jurisdiction) to qualify for all applicable exemptions and reductions of all possible Transfer Taxes). 

  

 (vi) _Post-Closing Transfers_. For the avoidance of doubt, any Transfer Taxes resulting from any transfer by Buyer or its Affiliates after the Closing of any Transferred Asset or Assumed Liability, any asset or liability of any Transferred Subsidiary, or any other property owned after the Closing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (other than any Transfer Taxes resulting from any transfers occurring after the Closing pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.14) shall be borne by Buyer and any Tax Returns relating thereto shall be prepared and filed by Buyer. To the extent that any refund, credit or rebate reduces the amount of any Transfer Taxes referred to in the preceding sentence, such refund, credit or rebate shall be for the benefit of Buyer. 

  

 (g) _Contest Provisions_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened audits or assessments with respect to Taxes for which such other party (or such other partys Affiliates) may be liable hereunder. Seller shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the defense of and, at its option, take control of the complete defense of, any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding to the extent that it relates to Taxes for which it may be liable, and to employ counsel and other advisors of its choice at its expense. Neither party may agree to settle any claim for Taxes for which the other may be liable without the prior written consent of such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (h) _Buyer s Claiming, Receiving or Using of Refunds and Overpayments_. If, after the Closing, Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Transferred Subsidiary) (A) receives any refund arising from or relating to any Tax paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates or which is the subject of indemnification by Seller hereunder, or (B) utilizes the benefit of any overpayment or prepayment of Taxes which, in each case, arose from or relates to a Tax paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates or which is the subject of indemnification by Seller hereunder, Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause to be transferred, to Seller the entire amount of the refund, overpayment, or prepayment (including interest) received or utilized by Buyer or its Affiliates (including 

   any Transferred Subsidiary) after deducting any Tax cost actually realized, or
other out of pocket cost or expense attributable incurred in the utilization
of such refund, overpayment or prepayment (including interest). Buyer agrees
to notify Seller promptly of both the discovery of a right to claim any such
refund, overpayment or prepayment and the receipt of any such refund or
utilization of any such overpayment or prepayment. Buyer agrees to claim any
such refund or to utilize any such overpayment or prepayment as soon as
possible, and to furnish to Seller all information, records and assistance
necessary to verify the amount so claimed or utilized and the amount due from
Buyer under this section.

  

 (i) _Seller s Rights With Respect to Loss Sharing With Respect to Transferred Subsidiaries and Pre-Closing Periods_. 

  

 (i) _Seller s Right to Utilize Pre-Closing Losses of the Transferred Subsidiaries_. With respect to any tax losses of any Transferred Subsidiary which arose during any Pre-Closing Period or arose during the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing, Seller reserves the right to utilize such losses to reduce any Taxes for which Seller would otherwise be liable (including Taxes of any Transferred Subsidiary or of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller that is not a Transferred Subsidiary), whether utilizing such losses occurs by operation of law, pursuant to an election, such as an election to surrender losses of one entity to another entity, or by any other means. 

  

 (ii) _Seller s Right to Reduce Pre-Closing Taxes of Transferred Subsidiaries Using Losses of Retained Subsidiaries_. Seller reserves the right to reduce any Taxes of any Transferred Subsidiary for which Seller would otherwise be liable by utilizing any tax losses of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller that is not a Transferred Subsidiary), whether utilizing such losses occurs by operation of law, pursuant to an election, such an election to surrender losses of one entity to another entity, or by any other means. 

  

 (j) _Post-Closing Actions That Could Affect Seller s Liability for Taxes_. 

  

 (i) After the Closing except to the extent that Seller has given its prior written consent neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including any Transferred Subsidiary) shall (A) amend any Tax Return filed by or with respect to any Transferred Subsidiary for any taxable period or portion thereof beginning before the Closing Date or (B) file any Tax Return or claim with any Taxing authority for the carry-back of any loss, deduction or credit from any taxable period or portion thereof ending after the Closing Date to any taxable period or portion thereof beginning prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (ii) During any taxable year of any Transferred Subsidiary beginning before the Closing Date and ending on or before the following December 31, Buyer shall not permit any Transferred Subsidiary to (A) sell, exchange, distribute, reorganize or otherwise dispose of any property (including but not limited to the stock of any subsidiary corporation) or engage in any other transaction that is treated for U.S. 

   federal income tax purposes as a sale, exchange, distribution, reorganization
or disposition of any property if, in each case, such transaction produces
foreign personal holding company income within the meaning of Section
954(a)(1) of the Code or income that would be passive income or passive
category income within the meaning of Section 904(d)(1)(A) of the Code or (B)
make or cause any distribution (including a deemed distribution) to
shareholders in excess of the amount of earnings and profits (as computed for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) derived during the period beginning after
the Closing and ending at the end of that taxable year (as if such period were
a single taxable year).

  

 (k) _Determination and Allocation of Consideration_. The parties to this Agreement agree to determine the amount of the Consideration (as defined below) transferred by Buyer and its Affiliates to Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement and to allocate that Consideration in accordance with the fair market value of the assets and liabilities transferred. At least 30 days prior the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with one or more schedules setting forth the total amount of the expected Consideration as of the first Business Day following the Closing and its allocation among the Transferred Assets, which allocation shall be consistent with the allocation (if any) set forth in Schedule 5.4 as of the date hereof. If Buyer notifies Seller of its disagreement with any items reflected on the schedules so provided, Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve the disagreement; to the extent Seller and Buyer cannot agree within 10 days after Seller delivers such schedules to Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall jointly submit their disagreement to the New York City office of an independent "Big Four" accounting firm or such other accounting firm reasonably acceptable to both Seller and Buyer for resolution and the decision of such accounting firm shall be rendered within 10 days after such firm is retained and shall final and binding on the parties. Seller and Buyer shall share equally the costs of employing such accounting firm. Seller and Buyer agree to prepare and file any Tax Returns or forms required to be filed with any Taxing authority with respect to such allocation in a timely fashion in accordance with the applicable rules. To the extent that the Consideration is finally determined or is adjusted after the Closing Date, the parties agree to revise and amend the schedule(s) and any such Tax Returns or forms in the same manner and according to the same procedure. The determination and allocation of the Consideration derived pursuant to this Section 5.4(k) shall be binding on Seller and Buyer and all their respective Affiliates for all Tax reporting purposes. Any amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.13 shall be allocated in accordance with the provisions of this Section, except to the extent the parties agree that all or any portion of such payment is disproportionately attributable to a specific asset or assets, in which case that portion will be allocated to the asset(s) to which it is attributable. " _Consideration_ " shall mean, as of the time it is being determined, the sum of (i) the Initial Purchase Price or the Total Purchase Price, as the case may be; and (ii) Assumed Liabilities; reduced by (iii) the net amount paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates to Buyer or any of its Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.5(p)(iii) (but not taking into account any interest paid pursuant to Section 5.5(p)(iii)) and by (iv) any Delayed Closing Payment. 

   (l) _Newco Entities and Pre-Closing Tailoring Transfers_. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer and use commercially reasonable efforts to take any actions requested by Buyer so as to cause an increase in the basis for any relevant Tax purposes of any asset transferred to a Newco Entity or transferred in a Pre-Closing Tailoring Transfer, _provided that_ any additional cost incurred by Seller or any Affiliate as a result of taking any such action will be borne by Buyer to the extent that Buyer has given its prior written consent and in the absence of having received such written consent Seller shall be free to conduct the transfer in any way that Seller determines. 

  

 (m) _Assistance, Cooperation, Notification and Correspondence Sharing_. After the Closing Date, each party (and its Affiliates) shall (i) cooperate fully and provide assistance to the other party (and its Affiliates) in preparing any Tax Returns and preparing for and handling any audits by or disputes with any Tax authorities and (ii) provide timely notice to the other party in writing of any pending or proposed audits or assessments with respect to Taxes for which such other party or any of its Affiliates may have a liability under this Agreement and furnish the other with copies of all relevant correspondence received from any Tax authority in connection therewith. 

  

 (n) _Employee Withholding and Reporting Matters_. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate to coordinate all employee-related Tax withholding and reporting for the year in which the Closing occurs. 

  

 (o) _Maintenance of Buyer s Books and Records_. Until the applicable statute of limitations (including periods of waiver) has run for any Tax Returns filed or required to be filed covering the periods up to and including the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, retain all Business Books and Records included in the Transferred Assets with respect to the Business in existence on the Closing Date and after the Closing Date will provide Seller access to such Business Books and Records for inspection and copying by Seller, or its agents upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice. After the expiration of such period, no such Business Books and Records shall be destroyed by Buyer without first advising Seller in writing and giving Seller a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof, any costs of transferring such Business Books and Records to be paid by Seller. 

  

 (p) _No Double Recovery_. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Buyer nor Seller shall be entitled to receive indemnification from the other in respect of (i) the amount of any Tax has already been paid by such other party to the appropriate Taxing Authority or (ii) all or any portion of any Loss more than once, in each case, whether proceeding under this Section 5.4 or Article 7. 

  

 Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_. (a) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Applicable Employees_ " means the following: 

  

 (A)All persons who are Employees on the Closing Date, but, other than with respect to Employees of a Transferred Subsidiary, excluding any Employees who have formally elected to retire and whose retirement date is no later than the first day of the calendar month immediately following the Closing Date; and 

   (B) All non-U.S. employees of Seller and its Affiliates as required by the Acquired Rights and country and local Laws; and 

  

 (ii) " _Transferred Employees_ " means those Applicable Employees who, effective as of the Closing Date (A) accept offers of employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates or (B) transfer automatically under the Acquired Rights or applicable local Laws or as a result of being employed by a Transferred Subsidiary. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to the Acquired Rights, Seller shall retain all Liabilities related to any STD Employees unless and until such STD Employee accepts Buyers offer of employment and commences employment with Buyer, at which time such STD Employee shall be treated as a Transferred Employee.

  

 (b) Where and to the extent that the transfer of the Business will constitute the transfer of an undertaking or business for the purposes of the Acquired Rights or the Applicable Employees are employees of a Transferred Subsidiary, and in either case the employment of the Applicable Employees will automatically transfer to Buyer or one of its Affiliates, the employment of the Applicable Employees shall not be terminated upon the Closing and the rights, powers, duties, liabilities and obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates to or in respect of such employees in respect of any contract of employment with such employees in force immediately before the Closing shall be transferred to Buyer and/or one of its Affiliates in accordance with the Acquired Rights or local employment or other Laws (including, if applicable, in accordance with the requirements of any applicable works council or other employee body agreement). 

  

 To the extent that Acquired Rights or the local employment or other Laws do not provide for the automatic transfer of employees upon the transfer of a business or part of a business as a going concern (or in any jurisdiction where the Acquired Rights or local employment or other Laws do provide for the automatic transfer of employees upon the transfer of a business or part of a business as a going concern but for any reason any employee does not transfer automatically by operation of law) or upon the transfer of a Transferred Subsidiary, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, at least 15 days prior to the Closing Date (or within the period of time required by local Law), offer employment in writing to each Applicable Employee, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall allow each such Applicable Employee 10 days (or the period of time required by local Law) to consider such offer and shall notify Seller promptly (but not later than 5 days prior to Closing) whether each such offer has been accepted or rejected. Each offer of employment made by Buyer or one of its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 5.5(b) shall provide for employment on the Current Employment Terms commencing on the Closing Date, or, if as of the Closing such Applicable Employee is an STD Employee, upon the return of such Applicable Employee to active service in accordance with the terms of such Employees leave, _provided_ that Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to 

   hire any such Applicable Employee who does not return to active service prior
to the first anniversary of the Closing Date unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

  

 (c) Effective immediately following the Closing Date and except as may be required by applicable Law or this Section 5.5, for a period ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Buyer shall cause all Transferred Employees to receive total cash compensation and other benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such employees by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date (excluding any stock-based benefits, "pension benefits" and post-retirement welfare benefits, as defined in and to extent excluded from "Current Employment Terms" and subject to the qualifications therein) and any other additional terms and conditions of employment required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall, for the Continuation Period, maintain a severance or termination arrangement for the benefit of each Transferred Employee that is no less favorable than, as applicable, the severance and termination arrangements provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates to such Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall retain all responsibility in respect of any Transferred Employees who on the Closing Date are eligible for retirement under the terms of the applicable benefit plans of Seller and its Affiliates in the jurisdictions set forth on Schedule 5.5(c) for the accrued post-retirement welfare benefits, if any, to which such employees may be entitled after their termination of employment with Buyer and its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of such plans as the same may be amended by Seller or its Affiliates from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything therein to the contrary, nothing contained herein is intended to, and to the full extent permitted by applicable Law, shall not (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) other than as required by applicable Law, obligate Buyer or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular Employee, each of whose employment may be terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates at any time, or (iii) give any third party the right to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

 (d) Buyer shall assume and be responsible for (i) any liabilities or Losses arising out of or related to any claim in relation to termination of employment, including any claim for severance, termination pay or similar such benefits under any plan, policy, practice or agreement of Seller by (A) any Applicable Employee who is (i) not offered employment on the Current Employment Terms by Buyer and/or one of its Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.5(b) or (ii) is offered employment on the Current Employment Terms, but the process by which such offer is made by Buyer and its Affiliates is not consistent with the requirements of applicable Law and (B) any Transferred Employee who is entitled to severance due to Buyers noncompliance with Section 5.5(c), 5.5(o) or 5.5(p) and (ii) all liabilities and obligations to provide any severance to any Transferred Employee pursuant to any individual arrangements covering any such Transferred Employee as set forth on Schedule 5.5(d)(which shall describe for each applicable Transferred Employee the terms of such severance and the 

   period during which such severance obligation applies) and whose employment is
terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates within 12 months following the Closing
Date (or to the extent applicable under any individual arrangement, within
such longer period as set forth on Schedule 5.5(d)), which severance shall
offset any severance provided for under the second sentence of Section 5.5(c).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall be responsible
for any liabilities or Losses arising out of or related to any claim in
relation to termination of employment, including any claim for severance,
termination pay or similar such benefits under any plan, policy, practice or
agreement of Seller by any Applicable Employee, who is entitled to any such
claim (i) notwithstanding the receipt of an offer on the Current Employment
Terms made by Buyer or one of its Affiliates using a process consistent with
the requirements of applicable Law and/or (ii) solely as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 (e) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 5.5, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses imposed on the Seller Indemnified Parties resulting from the violation of the Acquired Rights or other local Laws by Buyer or its Affiliates. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 5.5(c) and (d), Buyer agrees that it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses imposed on the Seller Indemnified Parties directly or indirectly relating to or arising out of the termination of employment of, or the wrongful discharge, including constructive discharge, by Buyer or its Affiliates of any Transferred Employee or the violation by Buyer or its Affiliates of any law, regulation or agreement (including employee contracts) with respect to any Employee. Seller shall retain, and Buyer shall not be responsible for, any Liabilities (other than Liabilities related to the Transferred Subsidiary Benefit Plans) that could be imposed on Buyer by reason of the Business being part of a "controlled group of corporations" with Seller within the meaning of Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code. 

  

 (f) Buyer shall, and shall cause its relevant Affiliates to, on a timely basis, provide Seller with such information as Seller may reasonably request as is necessary for Seller and its Affiliates to comply with any legal requirement (whether statutory or pursuant to any written agreement with, or the constitution of, any works council or other employee body), to consult with the Applicable Employees (or any of them), a relevant trade union, a relevant works council or any other employee representatives in relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

 (g) Seller shall remain liable and retain responsibility for, and continue to pay in accordance with the terms of the applicable plans, all medical, life insurance and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for each Transferred Employee with respect to claims incurred by such Transferred Employee (or such Employees covered dependents) on or prior to the Closing Date, and shall remain liable for workers compensation claims (including medical, disability, permanency and expense claims) incurred by any Transferred Employee on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall be 

   liable and responsible for all expenses and benefits with respect to claims
incurred by Transferred Employees (or their covered dependents) after the
Closing Date. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim is deemed incurred: in
the case of medical or dental benefits, when the services that are the subject
of the claim are performed; in the case of life insurance, when the death
occurs; and in the case of accidental death and dismemberment or workers
compensation claims, when the event giving rise to the claim occurs.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective as of the Closing Date, each
Transferred Subsidiary shall remain responsible for all such expenses and
benefits with respect to claims incurred under the Transferred Subsidiary
Benefit Plans whether incurred before, on or after the Closing Date, as well
as for any and all obligations under the Transferred Subsidiary Benefit Plans
with respect to long term disability benefits for the Transferred Employees
employed by the Transferred Subsidiaries.

  

 (h) With respect to any Buyer Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA), or any non-U.S. Buyer Plan that would be considered a "welfare benefit plan" if it were subject to ERISA, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, to the extent practicable and commercially reasonable, (i) waive any pre-existing condition, actively at work requirements and waiting periods that were applicable to such Transferred Employees under the coverage provided by Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date and (ii) cause such plans to honor any expenses incurred by the Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries under similar plans of Seller and its Affiliates during the portion of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses. 

  

 (i) The Transferred Employees shall be given credit for all service with Seller and any of its Affiliates (and their respective predecessors), to the same extent as such service was credited for such purposes by Seller or any of its Affiliates under each Buyer Plan in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to participate, effective as of the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual (including without limitation with respect to vacation and severance benefits, but, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, in all cases excluding any defined benefit pension plans, severance benefit plans and other severance arrangements to the extent such service credit would result in a duplication of such benefits) and, to the extent applicable to any non-U.S. Transferred Employees, seniority. 

  

 (j) Except as required by applicable Law or with respect to any Transferred Subsidiary Benefit Plan, and except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.5, as of the Closing Date (or, as applicable, as of such later date that an STD Employee becomes a Transferred Employee), the Transferred Employees shall cease to accrue further benefits under the employee benefit plans and arrangements maintained by Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) and shall commence participation in Buyer Plans.

   (k) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, engage in any activity intended to discourage any Applicable Employee from accepting an offer of employment from Buyer and/or one of its Affiliates and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that Applicable Employees (other than Applicable Employees who have applied for a position outside the Business prior to the date hereof) will not be offered employment by businesses of Seller (other than the Business) after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and its Affiliates shall be permitted to take any action they are legally required to take in order to comply with local employment Laws.

  

 (l) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time (including flexible time-off) to which any Transferred Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy applicable to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Vacation Policy_ "), Buyer shall assume the liability for such accrued vacation time and allow such Transferred Employee to use such accrued vacation or to cash out such accrued vacation time as and to the extent required by applicable Law. 

  

 (m) Seller shall be responsible for providing or discharging any and all notifications, benefits and liabilities to Transferred Employees and governmental authorities required by WARN or by any other applicable Law relating to plant closings or employee separations or severance pay that are required to be provided before the Closing as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyer shall be responsible for any and all such matters following the Closing. Seller shall cooperate in preparing and distributing any notices that Buyer may desire to provide prior to the Closing in connection with actions by Buyer after the Closing that would result in a notice requirement under such Laws. For purposes of this Section 5.5(m), Buyer shall be deemed to have caused a mass layoff if the mass layoff would not have occurred but for Buyers failure to offer to employ the Transferred Employees in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (n) Buyer shall be liable under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ "), or other applicable U.S. Law, for any liability arising from the actions (or inactions) of Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to the Transferred Employees after the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible for providing all Employees (and their dependents) with any notices required by COBRA with respect to any qualifying events that occur on or prior to the Closing Date and retain all obligations with respect to continued coverage under COBRA (and any similar state law), Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder for all Applicable Employees who do not become Transferred Employees; _provided_ that the Transferred Subsidiaries and Buyer shall be liable for all obligations under COBRA in respect of current and former employees of the Transferred Subsidiaries whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date under any Transferred Subsidiary Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the immediately preceding sentence, to the extent required by Treasury Regulations Section 54.4980B-9, QandA 8(c), Buyer shall perform all obligations under COBRA and the foregoing provisions of the 

   Code and ERISA with respect to each employee of Seller who is an "MandA
qualified beneficiary" with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as such term is defined by Treasury Regulations Section 54.4980B-9,
QandA 4.

  

 (o) (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause a Buyer Plan that is intended to be a U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution pension plan (the " _Buyer U.S. Pension Replacement Plan_ ") to accept the enrollment of the Transferred Employees who participated in the Kodak Retirement Income Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _U.S. Pension Replacement Plan Employees_ "). During the Continuation Period, Buyer shall cause the U.S. Pension Replacement Plan Employees to be provided with benefits under the Buyer U.S. Pension Replacement Plan that are no less favorable than the benefits described on Schedule 5.5(o)(i).

  

 (ii) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause Buyer Plans that are "defined contribution pension plans" within the meaning of FAS87 (each, a " _Non-U.S. Pension Replacement Plan_ ") to accept the enrollment of the Transferred Employees who participated in the defined benefit pension plans in the jurisdictions set forth on Schedule 5.5(o)(ii) immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Non-U.S._ _Pension Replacement Plan Employees_ "). During the Continuation Period, Buyer shall cause the Non-U.S. Pension Replacement Plan Employees to be provided with benefits under the applicable Buyer Non-U.S. Pension Replacement Plans that are no less favorable than the applicable benefits described on Schedule 5.5(o)(ii). 

  

 (p) (i) Buyer shall assume and be responsible for the liabilities in respect of each Transferred Employee who participated in a plan that is a "defined benefit pension plan" within the meaning of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87 (" _FAS87_ ") listed on Schedule 5.5(p)(i) (each such plan, a " _Seller Non-U.S. Pension_ _Plan_ ") on the Closing Date (the " _Non-U.S. Pension Plan Employees_ "). Except as set forth on Schedule 5.5(p)(i) or (ii), no such pension liabilities shall be assumed by and no such pension assets shall be transferred to Buyer in any jurisdiction.

  

 (ii) To the extent provided in Schedule 5.5(p)(ii), Seller shall effect a transfer of assets from the Seller Non-U.S. Pension Plans in respect of the liability for each Non-U.S. Pension Plan Employee in such amounts as shall be determined in accordance with Schedule 5.5(p)(ii), and Buyer shall cause a Buyer Plan to accept such assets, Seller shall select the kind of assets to be transferred if there are alternate forms of assets that may be transferred under local Law or existing agreement, provided that such form is reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Where no assets are required to be transferred hereunder, Seller and Buyer shall take such other steps to effectuate the provision of benefits under the applicable Seller Non-U.S. Pension Plans to the Non-U.S. Pension Plan Employees as set forth on Schedule 5.5(p)(ii). For purposes of this Section 5.5(p)(ii), the amount to be transferred shall be equitably adjusted to take into account benefit payments made from the Seller Non-U.S. Pension Plans to the applicable Non-U.S. Pension Plan Employees after the Closing Date but prior to the date of transfer (" _Interim Pension Payments_ "). Any transfer of assets pursuant to Section 5.5(p) shall take place within one year after the Closing Date; provided, however, that in no event shall such transfer take place until the receipt of any approval required by any Governmental Entity.

   (iii) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, for each Seller Non-U.S. Pension Plan, the actuary for Seller with respect to that plan shall determine the applicable actuarial liability for the Transferred Employees who participated in such plan and who will become participants in a corresponding Buyer Plan from and after the Closing Date using the applicable valuation method and the applicable actuarial assumptions as set forth on Schedule 5.5(p)(iii) for each such Seller Non-U.S. Pension Plan (each such amount, an " _Actuarial Liability_ "). The aggregate amount of such Actuarial Liabilities shall be referred to as the " _Maximum Shortfall Amount_ ". On the Closing Date, Seller shall pay Buyer $20,000,000 in cash on account of and to be credited in calculating the payment contemplated in the next sentence. Subject to Section 5.5(q) and to adjustment in the event that a Deferred Closing does not occur pursuant to Section 2.14(c), on the earlier to occur of (A) the date on which the last transfer of assets required pursuant to Section 5.5(p)(ii) occurs and (B) the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Shortfall Payment Date_ "), Seller shall pay Buyer in cash the amount equal to the excess of (x) ninety percent (90%) of the excess of the Maximum Shortfall Amount over the aggregate amount of (i) all Interim Pension Payments and (ii) the value of all assets transferred or otherwise made available to Buyer for purposes of satisfying its obligations in respect of the Non-U.S. Pension Plan Employees as contemplated by Section 5.5(p)(ii) over (y) $20,000,000, together with interest on such excess amount credited from the Closing Date through the Shortfall Payment Date at the interest rate determined in accordance with Schedule 5.5(p)(iii) (the " _Final Shortfall Amount_ "). If there is no excess and, instead, $20,000,000 exceeded the amount determined pursuant to clause (x) of the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller the amount of such overpayment with interest determined in accordance with Schedule 5.5(p)(iii). If any transfer of assets from a Seller Non-U.S. Pension Plan pursuant to Section 5.5(p)(ii) occurs after the Shortfall Payment Date, within 10 days following the date of such transfer, Buyer shall pay Seller in cash an amount equal to the value of the assets then transferred plus the amount of any Interim Pension Payments made from such Seller Non-U.S. Pension Plan. 

  

 (q) All amounts described in Sections 5.5(p), including without limitation the Maximum Shortfall Amount and the Final Shortfall Amount, shall be reasonably determined by the relevant actuary for the Seller Non-U.S. Pension Plan, subject to review and approval by an actuary designated by Buyer. If there is a good faith dispute between the relevant actuary for the Seller Non-U.S. Pension Plan and Buyers designated actuary as to the amounts described therein and such dispute remains unresolved for fourteen (14) days, Seller and Buyer shall select and appoint a third actuarial firm with international operations that is mutually satisfactory to both Seller and Buyer. At such time, the respective Buyer and Seller actuaries shall exchange with each other and submit to the third actuary their last best offer(s) to the other with respect the disputed amount(s). For each such disputed amount, the third actuary shall select one or 

   the other of such two offers and shall award such selection within thirty (30)
days, which selection shall be conclusive and binding on both Buyer and
Seller. The cost of such third actuary shall be divided equally between Seller
and Buyer. Each of Seller and Buyer shall be responsible for the cost of its
own actuary.

  

 (r) Buyer shall take all steps necessary to permit each Transferred Employee who has received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Eastman Kodak Employees Savings and Investment Plan or the Kodak Subsidiaries Savings Plan (together, the " _Seller s 401(k) Plans_"), if any, to rollover such eligible rollover distribution, including any associated loan of cash as part of any lump sum distribution to the extent permitted by Sellers 401(k) Plans into an account under a U.S. Pension Replacement Plan as of the Closing Date. In addition, Buyer shall take all steps necessary to cause one or more analogous Buyer Plans to accept the enrollment of any non-U.S. Transferred Employees who participated in any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan that is a "defined contribution plan" ; within the meaning of FAS87 immediately prior to the Closing Date, and, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law, Seller shall cause to be transferred from each such plan the liabilities, and as applicable, the assets, for the account balances of those non-U.S. Transferred Employees.

  

 (s) Unless such delivery would be unduly burdensome to Seller, and to the extent delivery to Buyer is permitted by applicable Law, subject to and after giving effect to a consent or waiver from each Transferred Employee to which such records relate, Seller shall deliver to Buyer such medical records relating to the Transferred Employees as may be reasonably requested by Buyer for purposes of providing medical coverage to the Transferred Employees after the Closing Date, or such other purpose as may be reasonably necessary for Buyers management or administration of the Business from and after the Closing Date.

Seller further acknowledges that Seller has been substantially responsible for the growth and development of the Business and the creation and preservation of the Business goodwill. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Business would be irreparably damaged if Seller were to violate the provisions of this Section 5.13(a). Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements set forth in Section 5.9 and this Section 5.13(a) were a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and that Buyer would not obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically negotiated by the Parties if Seller were to breach the provisions of Section 5.9 or this Section 5.13(a). Therefore, in further consideration for the payment of consideration to Seller hereunder, and in order to protect the value of the Business acquired by Buyer hereunder (including the goodwill inherent in the Business), Seller hereby agrees that for a period of three (3) years, except in the United States, where it shall be five (5) years, following the Closing Date, it shall not, and it shall cause 

   each of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, in any manner
whatsoever, including, either individually or in association with any other
Person, or as principal, licensor, agent, representative, equity holder,
distributor, manufacturer, co-venturer, director or partner, compete with
Buyer and its Affiliates in the Healthcare Field anywhere in the world;
_provided_ that Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to (i) be a
beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934) (a " _Beneficial Owner_ ") of not more than 5% of the total debt and
equity interests, in the aggregate, in any business that competes with the
Business so long as no directorship or other governance rights are held by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in conjunction with the ownership of such
interest; (ii) engage in activities expressly contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements; (iii) manufacture, market, sell or distribute
products with multiple market functionality not designed specifically to be
used in the Business; (iv) sell, manufacture, market or distribute (A) sensors
contained in Sellers product catalog as of the date hereof (regardless of
optimization for the Healthcare Field), (B) new sensor products, provided that
the new sensor products are not optimized for the Healthcare Field and (C) new
sensor products which are optimized for the Healthcare Field, subject to
Buyers consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and (v)
transfer, license, sublicense or enter into an agreement not to assert, as the
case may be, patents to or against third parties that may include, but shall
not be limited to, use of such patents to manufacture, have manufactured, use,
offer to sell, sell and import products in the Healthcare Field (but no such
transfer, license, sublicense or agreement not to assert may provide for
payments based on net income from such activities or any management rights
with respect to such activities) and, _provided_ _further_ that Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries may acquire a Person that competes in the Healthcare
Field, so long as (x) the portion of such Persons business that competes in
the Healthcare Field generates annual revenues of no more than 25% of such
Persons consolidated annual revenues for the most recent fiscal year of such
Person prior to the acquisition (the " _Competing Business_ "), and (y) the
terms and conditions set forth in the paragraph immediately following are
satisfied.

  

 In the event that any Competing Business is acquired by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, Seller shall provide written notice to Buyer no later than 15 days after the consummation of such acquisition, describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Competing Business and the manner in which such Competing Business competes in the Healthcare Field. Any such Competing Business shall be operated on a "stand-alone" basis, without sales or marketing support by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and without use of Sellers or any of its Subsidiaries Intellectual Property. Further, in the event that the consolidated annual revenues for the most recent fiscal year of the Competing Business prior to the acquisition of such Competing Business exceed 1% of the consolidated annual revenues of the Business as of the most recent fiscal year of the Business prior to the acquisition of such Competing Business, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cease to operate the Competing Business prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the consummation of the acquisition of the Competing Business or cause a complete divestiture of the Competing Business as follows: 

   (1) Buyer shall have the right, within 90 days from the closing of the acquisition of the Competing Business by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Divesting Business Offer Period_ "), to make a binding offer (to remain open for six (6) months) to acquire the Competing Business (a " _Divesting Business Offer_ "). During the Divesting Business Offer Period, subject to customary confidentiality arrangements, Seller shall make available to Buyer an offering memorandum, if one exists, and reasonable due diligence information relating to the Competing Business. Any Divesting Business Offer must specify the proposed purchase price and other material terms for the acquisition of the Competing Business. If Buyer timely submits a Divesting Business Offer and no Transfer (as defined below) of the Competing Business is consummated during the six (6)-month period following such submission of a Divesting Business Offer, Buyer shall have the right, within 30 days following the end of such six (6)-month period (the period from the closing of the acquisition of the Competing Business through the end of such 30-day period is the " _First Period_ "), to make another binding offer (to remain open for six (6) months) to acquire the Competing Business (a " _Second Divesting Business Offer_ "). Any Second Divesting Business Offer must specify the proposed purchase price and other material terms for the acquisition of the Competing Business. In the event that Buyer does not timely make a Divesting Business Offer, Seller shall be free to directly or indirectly effect a transfer, assignment or sublicense, whether through sale of assets, sale of stock, change of control, operation of law or otherwise (a " _Transfer_ ") of the Competing Business to any Person upon any terms and conditions. In the event that Buyer timely makes a Divesting Business Offer but does not timely make a Second Divesting Business Offer, Seller shall be free following the expiration of the First Period to directly or indirectly effect a Transfer of the Competing Business to any Person upon any terms and conditions. 

  

 (2) Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any affirmative obligation to accept any Divesting Business Offer or Second Divesting Business Offer, _provided_ , _however_ , that (xx) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries may Transfer the Competing Business to any Person other than Buyer (a " _Third-Party Divesting Buyer_ ") (A) during the First Period for a purchase price and other material terms less favorable to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries than those contained in Buyers Divesting Business Offer; provided, further, that whether the purchase price and other material terms are less favorable in the aggregate to Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be determined in the good faith judgment of Seller, or (B) following the expiration of the First Period for a purchase price and other material terms less favorable to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries than those contained in Buyers Second Divesting Business Offer; provided, further, that whether the purchase price and other material terms are less favorable in the aggregate to Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be determined in the good faith judgment of Seller; and (yy) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be required to either (i) accept the Second Divesting Business Offer or (ii) cease to operate the Competing Business in the event that a Transfer of the Competing Business to a Third-Party Divesting Buyer is not consummated on or prior to the Divestiture Deadline (as defined below).

   (3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller must Transfer the Competing Business no later than one (1) year following the earlier to occur of (x) the expiration of the Divesting Business Offer Period and (y) the receipt of a Divesting Business Offer (the earlier to occur of such dates, the " _Divesture Deadline_ ").

  

 (b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller would be irreparably damaged if Buyer were to violate the provisions of this Section 5.13(b). Buyer hereby agrees that for a period of three (3) years, except in the United States, where it shall be five (5) years, following the Closing Date, it shall not, and it shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, including, either individually or in association with any other Person, or as principal, licensor, agent, representative, equity holder, distributor, manufacturer, co-venturer, director or partner, or by agreeing not to assert against a third party any of Buyers or any of its Affiliates Intellectual Property rights, compete with Sellers Business, _provided_ that Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to (i) be a Beneficial Owner of not more than 5% of the total debt and equity interests, in the aggregate, in any business that competes with Sellers Business so long as no directorship or other governance rights are held by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in conjunction with the ownership of such interest and (ii) engage in activities expressly contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, sensors sold by Seller in accordance with Sections 5.13(a)(iv)(A) to the extent sensors are optimized for the Healthcare Field and 5.13(a)(iv)(C) above shall not contain Sellers branding.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.9 or 5.13(a) to the contrary, if at any time, in any judicial or arbitration proceeding, any of the restrictions stated in such sections is found by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator(s) to be unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable under circumstances then existing, Buyer and Seller each agrees that the period, scope or geographical area, as the case may be, shall be reduced to the extent necessary to enable the court and arbitrator(s) to enforce the restrictions to the extent such provisions are allowable under applicable law, giving effect to the agreement and intent of the parties that the restrictions contained in such sections shall be effective to the fullest extent permissible. Buyer and Seller agree that the restrictions contained in Section 5.9 and Section 5.13 are reasonable in all respects and necessary to protect Buyers interest in and the value of the Business and Sellers interest in and the value of Sellers Business, respectively.

  

 (e) The parties acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach by either party or any of their respective Affiliates of any of the provisions of Section 5.9, 5.12 or 5.13, monetary damages shall not constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently, in the event of any such breach, either party or their respective successors or assigns may, 

   in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any
court of law or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance or
injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of
the provisions hereof, in each case without the requirement of posting a bond
or proving actual damages.

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Section 5.13 shall prevent Seller or any of its Affiliates from operating the Business in any Deferred Closing Country after the Closing and before the applicable Deferred Closing to the extent contemplated by Section 2.14.

  

 Section 5.14 _Contractual Arrangements_. In order to perform the partial assignment of the Divisible Contracts to Buyer, Seller undertakes to notify, or cause its Affiliates to notify, the counterparties thereto of the partial assignment of the Divisible Contracts by Seller or an Affiliate to Buyer or, to the extent required under any Divisible Contract, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the prior consent of the counterparties to the partial assignment of such Divisible Contracts. Buyer agrees to commit to the terms set forth on Schedule 5.14 relating to the Divisible Contracts. Buyer further agrees to cooperate with Seller in connection with the arrangement of the partial assignment or any other appropriate arrangement (including the jointly determined allocation of Sellers and Buyers respective rights and obligations thereunder) in connection with the Divisible Contracts. 

  

 Section 5.15 _Real Estate Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Non-Transferability of the Owned Real Property_. 

  

 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer of any Owned Real Property or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any governmental or third party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing or would require operational separation from other assets owned by Seller or its Affiliates and such operational separation shall not have been completed prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, operational separation shall be deemed to include the physical separation or disconnection of any portion of the Owned Real Property from any other real property owned by Seller or its Affiliates (including the disconnection of infrastructure such as utility pipes, lines, wires and other interconnections), the purchase and installation of new infrastructure or assets or the upgrading and improvement of existing infrastructure or assets to replace the disconnected infrastructure or to provide the service previously provided by such disconnected infrastructure, as may be required by Law, applicable regulatory authorities or as deemed necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion 

   of Seller and Buyer, and all costs related thereto. Any component or aspect of
such operational separation that solely affects the Building 214 Facility (and
does not affect any other building at Kodak Park) shall be made in the sole
discretion of Buyer. Following the Closing, the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, and cooperate with each other to obtain promptly such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers and/or effectuate such
separation and the parties agree to execute, acknowledge and deliver any
instruments, or enter into any arrangements as may be reasonably necessary to
effectuate the foregoing. The cost and expense relating to operational
separation shall be the responsibility of Buyer and all work required to
accomplish an operational separation which is necessary or required to be
performed as a condition to obtaining any authorizations, approvals, consents
or waivers in connection with such operational separation shall be
the responsibility of Buyer. Except as set forth in the previous sentence,
the cost and expense relating to obtaining any governmental or third party
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers (including with respect to the
subdivision of the Building 214 Facility) relating to the Owned Real Property
shall be the responsibility of Seller. To the extent that any portion of the
Owned Real Property cannot be transferred to Buyer at the Closing pursuant to
this Section 5.15, then Buyer and Seller shall, subject to applicable Law,
enter into one or more ground lease arrangements of the Owned Real Property to
provide to Buyer the economic (taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and
operational equivalent, of Seller and/or its Affiliates transferring ownership
of such Owned Real Property to Buyer, with the result being that all benefits,
rights and privileges of ownership shall inure to the benefit of Buyer and
Buyer shall assume liability for all obligations associated with such
ownership from and after the date of Closing. Seller hereby consents to the
grant by Buyer to its lenders of a mortgage and security interest on any such
leasehold interest and further agrees that each such lease shall contain
customary lender protection provisions reasonably acceptable to Seller,
including lenders rights of notice and cure and collateral access agreements.
Once authorization, approval, consent or waiver or operational separation, as
applicable, required for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of any Owned Real Property not sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed
or delivered at the Closing is obtained, Seller shall, or shall cause a
Subsidiary to, promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver such Owned Real
Property to Buyer at no additional cost, such conveyance to be in all other
respects in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. To the
extent permitted under applicable Tax law, for all Tax purposes the parties
shall treat all such assets as having been transferred by Seller to Buyer at
the Closing.

  

 (ii) The parties agree to cooperate with each other, and to cause their Affiliates to cooperate, subject to the rules and regulations, if any, then in force and effect by either of the respective parties (provided that copies of such rules and regulations have been provided to the other party), to allow reasonable access during regular business hours and the right of ingress, egress and passage, to (A) Seller and its Affiliates, with respect to the Owned Real Property, and (B) Buyer with respect to the real properties owned by Seller or its Affiliates adjacent to the Owned Real Property, in each case as necessary to allow such party to maintain, operate and control the real property it owns in a manner consistent with commercially reasonable operating 

   standards for such property; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
such right of access granted hereunder cause an unreasonable interference with
or disruption to the other partys quiet enjoyment of its real property. The
parties further agree to execute, acknowledge and deliver any instruments, or
enter into similar arrangements as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate
the foregoing on such terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to
Seller and Buyer. Each party shall bear and pay its own costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees, incurred in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery and recordation of any such instruments.

  

 (b) _Consent Decree_. 

  

 (i) Buyer hereby acknowledges that one of the Owned Real Properties, known as the Building 214 Facility, is a portion of the "Kodak Park Facility" which is the subject of a certain Consent Decree by and between the United States of America and Seller entered in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Civil Action No. 94-CV-6503T) (the " _Consent Decree_ "). 

  

 (ii) Buyer agrees to conduct Buyers operations at the Building 214 Facility in accordance with, and to otherwise comply with, each and every requirement of the Consent Decree applicable to the Building 214 Facility and Buyers operations at the Building 214 Facility from and after the Closing Date for the remaining term of the Consent Decree. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer hereby agrees specifically to allow access to the Building 214 Facility, from and after the Closing Date for the remaining term of the Consent Decree, by (A) Seller and Sellers representatives; (B) the United States and the representatives of the United States (including but not limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (" _EPA_ "), and the EPAs employees, authorized agents, contractors and subcontractors); (C) the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (" _DEC_ "), and the DECs employees, authorized agents, contractors and subcontractors and (D) any other persons, authorities, agencies and entities as may be required by the Consent Decree, in each case for the purpose of conducting the testing, verification, inspections, investigations and monitoring required thereunder (collectively, the " _Consent Decree Activities_ "). Furthermore, without limiting the generality of the first sentence of this paragraph (b)(ii), Buyer agrees to: (i) maintain the environmental management program as it pertains to the Building 214 Facility in a manner sufficient to satisfy all requirements of the Consent Decree; and (ii) maintain the waste characterization program with respect to any waste generated by Buyer or any tenant in a manner sufficient to satisfy all requirements of the Consent Decree. 

  

 (iii) After the Closing and from time to time thereafter until termination of the Consent Decree, Seller shall reimburse Buyer, for any actual out-of-pocket expenditures incurred by Buyer in connection with Buyers compliance with the Consent Decree, other than expenditures which Buyer would otherwise be required to make in order to comply with applicable laws, rules, permits and regulations of any governmental authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) such expenditures that Buyer would 

   otherwise be required to make shall in no event be deemed to include
expenditures otherwise covered by Section 2.4(d), (B) Buyer shall be required
to submit to Seller reasonable supporting documentation substantiating any
such expenditures for which Buyer seeks reimbursement pursuant to the
foregoing, and (C) in any given calendar year in which Buyer has already
incurred Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) in aggregate expenditures for which
Buyer seeks reimbursement pursuant to the foregoing, Buyer shall thereafter be
required to obtain Sellers prior written approval (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of any additional out-of-
pocket expenditures incurred by Buyer during such calendar year; _provided_
that Buyer shall have no obligation hereunder to incur any costs which Seller
has not agreed to reimburse.

  

 (iv) The deed conveying title to the Building 214 Facility to Buyer shall contain a notice referencing that Seller has continuing obligations at the Building 214 Facility pursuant to the Consent Decree, and setting forth the case caption, Civil Action No. and the court having jurisdiction over the Consent Decree. 

  

 (v) When the Consent Decree is terminated, Seller will promptly provide written notice to Buyer and provide documentation of same, and Seller shall prepare and file a corrected deed, and/or record a memorandum evidencing the termination of the Consent Decree, at Sellers expense and in either case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and the Title Company.

 (a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than fifteen (15) days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of a Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third-Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third-Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure timely to give a Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have fifteen (15) days (or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim. 

  

 (b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense, with counsel of its choosing, at its expense and shall be responsible (with no reservation of any rights) for all Losses and Liability relating to such Third-Party Claim or the defense thereof. Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense at its expense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing. Once the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party agrees to keep the Indemnified Party informed regarding the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim and to consider in good faith any suggestions made by the Indemnified Party regarding the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, not to be unreasonably withheld, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would materially restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iii) any monetary liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, to retain control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim if such Third-Party Claim solely seeks non-monetary, equitable or injunctive relief against Buyer or its Affiliates.

   (c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise or (ii) after assuming the defense of a Third-Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim within fifteen (15) days after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the obligation to assume its own defense; _it_ _being_ _understood_ _that_ the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a Third-Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third-Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying Party.

  

 (d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by providing access to each others relevant business records and other documents, and employees. 

  

 (e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges. 

  

 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, contests and claims with respect to Taxes shall be governed by Section 5.4(g). 

  

 Section 7.5 _Environmental Indemnity Claims_. In addition to the other provisions in this Article VII, to the extent that indemnified Losses relate to Section 3.13 or to a Section 2.4(d) Excluded Liability, the following provisions apply: 

  

 Seller shall upon notice have the right to assume control of any remedial action relating to a Third Party Claim or covered Losses and may utilize the most cost effective remediation method permitted under Environmental Laws including, without limitation, the use of risk assessment, institutional controls, deed notice and use restrictions. Sellers liability for any matter in this regard is limited to the amount of any Liability for such Third Party Claim or covered Losses and the costs to correct any violation of any Environmental Law and shall not include any investigation or other costs not required by Environmental Laws or any Losses arising out of any investigation, sampling, excavation or voluntary contacts with any Government Entity by Buyer or Affiliates after the Closing, but excluding any such action taken by Buyer or its Affiliates to the extent (i) taken with the reasonable good faith belief that such actions are required by Law or (ii) incidental to ordinary course maintenance, repairs or operations. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize interference with business operations. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully in the conduct of any remediation, including site access, the provision of accurate information, including subsurface utility locations, site condition, and records and the execution, implementation and maintenance 

   of any filings, consents, institutional controls or deed restrictions. The
parties agree that the indemnification provisions of this Article VII are the
sole and exclusive remedy for any matter covered under this Section 7.5 and
Buyer hereby waives, to the extent it may do so, any other rights or remedies
that would otherwise have been available to it under common law, statute, or
otherwise.

  

 Section 7.6 _Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Person shall be liable under this Article VII for any consequential, punitive, special, incidental or indirect damages, including lost profits, except (i) to the extent awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction to a third-party in connection with a Third-Party Claim, (ii) to the extent of Losses directly or indirectly relating to, arising out of, in connection with, by virtue of or resulting from any intentional or willful breach by the non-claiming party and (iii) Seller shall be liable for consequential damages and lost profits, including for interruption of business, directly or indirectly relating to, arising out of, in connection with, by virtue of or resulting from (1) environmental remediation activities engaged in (x) by Seller or (y) with respect to any matter for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification, by Buyer (to the extent that Buyer (A) is permitted to engage in such environmental remediation activities under the terms of this Agreement, (B) consults with Seller prior to engaging in such environmental remediation activities and (C) uses reasonably prudent and diligent measures in conducting such environmental remediation activities) and (2) Buyers inability to operate the Business, or any material interference with or disruption of such operations, at any parcel of Owned Real Property on account of Sellers failure (x) to deliver the limited warranty deeds, as contemplated by Section 2.8(d) or (y) to transfer such Owned Real Property free of Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances); provided, however, that such failure to operate the Business, or material interference with or disruption of such operations, at any such parcel of Owned Real Property must take place between the Closing and the later to occur of (I) the date on which Seller delivers the limited warranty deed related to such parcel of Owned Real Property and (II) the date on which all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) to which the Owned Real Property was subject when transferred by Seller to Buyer are released. 

  

 Section 7.7 _Payments_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder no later than three days following any final determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Partys liability therefor. A "final determination" shall exist when (i) the parties to the dispute have reached an agreement in writing, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable order or judgment, or (iii) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-appealable determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to submit thereto. 

  

 Section 7.8 _Adjustments to Losses_. (a) _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or 

   payment by or against any other Person in each case relating to the Third-
Party Claim or other claim, net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums
(including the net present value of any increases in future premiums) incurred
in connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted. In
the event that an Indemnified Party has any rights against an insurer with
respect to any occurrence, claim or loss that results in a payment by an
Indemnifying Party under this Article VII, such Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to such rights to the extent of such payment. Without limiting the
generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party shall duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably
necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation and subordination rights
detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims.

  

 (b) _Taxes_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, there shall be deducted an amount equal to any net Tax benefit to the party claiming such Loss actually realized (if and when received and treating any such benefit as the last item of deduction for the taxable year) and there shall be added an amount equal (on an after-tax basis) to any Tax cost actually incurred by the party receiving such indemnity payment. 

  

 (c) _Reimbursement_. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from the third party in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount of such Loss. 

  

 Section 7.9 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. All payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant to Section 5.4, 7.2 or 7.3 hereof shall be treated as adjustments to the Total Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. 

  

 Section 7.10 _Mitigation_. Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss. In the event an Indemnified Party fails to so mitigate an indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for any portion of such Loss that reasonably could have been avoided had the Indemnified Person made such efforts. 

  

 Section 7.11 _Remedies_. The rights and remedies of Seller and Buyer under this Article VII are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies which Seller and Buyer may have under this Agreement or otherwise against each other with respect to the Transaction for monetary relief with respect to (i) any breach of any representation or warranty or any failure to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, other than those which are intentional or willful, and (ii) the Assumed Liabilities or the Excluded Liabilities, and Buyer and Seller each expressly waives any and all other rights or causes of action it or its Affiliates may have against the other party or its Affiliates now or in the future under any Law with respect to the subject matter hereof. However, nothing herein shall limit a partys rights and remedies for fraud.

   Section 7.12 _Specific Performance_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this Agreement by such party would give rise to irreparable harm to the other party for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy. Each party accordingly agrees that, in addition to other remedies, such party shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy and to obtain injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. 

  

 _ARTICLE VIII_

  

 _TERMINATION_

  

 Section 8.1 _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer. 

  

 Section 8.2 _Termination by Either Buyer or Seller_. (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by either Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of termination to the other party, if (i) the Closing shall not have occurred by September 30, 2007 (unless extended by written agreement of the parties hereto), so long as the party proposing to terminate has not breached in any material respect any of its covenants under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately contributed to the failure of the Closing to so occur; or (ii) any Law permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Transactions shall become final and non-appealable. 

  

 (b) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer at any time prior to the Closing if any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI that are for Buyers benefit are or become impossible to satisfy so long as Buyer is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (c) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller at any time prior to the Closing if any of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI that are for Sellers benefit are or become impossible to satisfy so long as Seller is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Article VIII, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability to the other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers or employees, except for the obligations of the parties hereto contained in this Section 8.3 and in Article IX (and any related definitional provisions set forth in Article I), and except that nothing in this Section 8.3 shall relieve any party from liability for any intentional or willful breach of this Agreement that arose prior to such termination, for which liability the provisions of Article VII shall remain in effect in accordance with the provisions and limitations of such Article.

   _ARTICLE IX_

 Section 9.2 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and Seller or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law except as otherwise specifically provided in Article VII hereof. 

  

 Section 9.3 _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, except as provided in Section 9.5 and except that Buyer may assign any and all of its rights under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to (i) one or more of its wholly owned subsidiaries or a Person with the same equity security holders as Buyer (provided that such Person (1) has the same equity security holders in the same percentages as Buyer up until the Closing and (2) unconditionally assumes Buyers obligations under this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and Financing Commitments), (ii) in connection with a merger or consolidation involving Buyer or the Business or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or any of the divisions 

   of Buyer or the Business, or (iii) any lender providing financing to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, for collateral security purposes and any subsequent
acquiror of assets from or at the direction of such lender (but no such
assignment pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) shall relieve Buyer of any
of its obligations hereunder). Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any Person other than Buyer, Seller, the
Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 9.3
shall require Buyers consent for an (i) acquisition of Seller, whether by
merger, operation of Law or otherwise or (ii) assignment by Seller of the IRR
Payment contemplated by Section 2.14.

  

 Section 9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Schedules and Exhibits hereto) and the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect until the Closing. 

  

 Section 9.5 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to any other party under this Agreement, or any of the Ancillary Agreements, which obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled completely and without any adverse legal implications to the obligee, by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Public Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except as may be required to comply with the requirements of any applicable law and the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties is listed, from and after the date hereof, no press release or similar public announcement or communication shall be made or caused to be made relating to this Agreement unless specifically approved in advance by both parties hereto. Each party shall provide the other with such advance notice of any such required disclosure as may be practicable under the circumstances. 

  

 Section 9.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, whether or not the Closing occurs, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses. 

  

 Section 9.8 _Interpretation_. All of the parties to this Agreement have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event any ambiguity or question of interpretation arises, this Agreement and the other documents and instruments executed in connection with this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or such other documents and instruments. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be 

   the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The
parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant
contained herein shall have independent significance. If any party has
breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty, or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) which the party has not breached shall not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty, or covenant. Any reference to any particular Code Section or any
other statute, law or regulation will be interpreted to include any revision
of or successor to that Section regardless of how it is numbered or
classified. The disclosure of any fact or item in any Seller Disclosure
Schedule or Buyer Disclosure Schedule hereto referenced by a particular
Section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to other Sections in this Agreement only to the extent the relevance of such
disclosure to such other Sections is readily apparent from the actual text of
such disclosure.

  

 Section 9.9 _Bulk Sales_. Seller and Buyer agree to waive compliance with Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in each of the jurisdictions in which any of the Transferred Assets are located to the extent that such Article is applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 9.10 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of_ _Forum; Waiver of Trial by Jury_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in New York County (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 9.1 of this Agreement. Each party hereto irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 9.11 _Dispute Resolution_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties shall attempt to resolve any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (each, a " _Dispute_ ") amicably and promptly by negotiations between executives from each party. Either party may give the other party written notice of any 

   Dispute not resolved in the normal course of business, in which case, the
parties executives (vice president or higher) shall negotiate alone (except
for one assistant who is not an attorney) in good faith to resolve the Dispute
within thirty (30) days after such notice is provided. In the event, however,
that (a) the Dispute is not resolved within such thirty (30) day period (or
any extension thereto to which the parties may mutually agree) or (b) that a
meeting between such executives has not occurred within such thirty (30) day
period, then regardless of whether any such good faith negotiations have
actually occurred, either party may bring a claim against the other with
respect to the subject matter of such Dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
either party may, at any time and without first engaging in any negotiations
with the other party, seek provisional injunctive relief that may be required
to maintain the status quo. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
such negotiations shall be deemed to be in the nature of settlement
discussions and that neither the fact that such discussions took place, nor
any statement or conduct of any participant in such discussions shall be
admissible into evidence in any subsequent litigation or in any arbitration or
other dispute resolution proceeding involving the parties. It is further
understood and agreed that any disclosure in any form, including oral, by any
person participating in such negotiations shall not operate as a waiver of any
privilege, including work product or attorney-client privilege, applicable to
the subject matter thereof.

  

 Section 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and via facsimile, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and the same Agreement, and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to Seller and Buyer. 

  

 Section 9.13 _Headings_. The headings herein and the table of contents hereof are for convenience only, and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. 

  

 Section 9.14 _Precedence_. To the extent there is any conflict between this Agreement and either any Ancillary Agreement or any General Conveyance Assignment Agreement, this Agreement shall govern, unless this Agreement, such Ancillary Agreement or General Conveyance Assignment Agreement expressly states otherwise. 

  

 Section 9.15 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed or caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE 
ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

  

 AMENDMENT No. 1, dated as of April 30, 2007 (this " _Amendment_ "), amends the Asset Purchase Agreement, by and between Eastman Kodak Company, a New Jersey corporation (" _Seller_ "), and Carestream Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation, formerly known as Onex Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (" _Buyer_ "), dated as of January 9, 2007 (the " _Initial Agreement_ " and, as amended hereby, the " _Agreement_ "). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Initial Agreement.

  

 WHEREAS, the parties have determined that it is in their mutual interest to amend the Initial Agreement as set forth herein; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and undertakings contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

 References in the Initial Agreement to "this Agreement" (and indirect references such as "hereunder", "hereby", "herein" and "hereof") shall in each case be deemed to be references to the Agreement (as defined herein). 

  

1. The title of Exhibit SS within the Agreement and the Seller Disclosure Schedule is hereby amended and restated as follows:

  

 Manaus Wide Roll Supply Agreement by and between Eastman Kodak Company and Carestream Health, Inc., formerly known as Onex Healthcare Holdings, Inc. 

  

2. A definition of "Currency Exchange Rate" is hereby added to Section 1.1 as follows:

  

 " _Currency Exchange Rate_ " has the meaning set forth in Section 2.5(b).

  

3. The definition of "Employees" in Section 1.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated as follows:

  

 " _Employees_ " means, as of the Closing Date, (i) all current employees of Seller or any of its Affiliates (including those employees who are on the active payroll of Seller or any of its Affiliates but who are not actively at work on the Closing Date, such as employees on vacation or similar leave, on a regularly scheduled day off from work, on temporary leave for purposes of jury or annual national service/military duty, on maternity, paternity or adoption leave, on leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (or any similar state or local Law), on leave under the Kodak Family Medical Leave Plan, or on other nonmedical leave of absence, and including all employees on military leave with veterans reemployment rights under applicable Law whether
or not such employees are on the active payroll of Seller or any of its
Affiliates on the Closing Date) who are identified by Seller as allocated to
the Business, as set forth on Schedule 1.1(b), which schedule shall include
(1) the name and location of such employee and (2) where no employee has been
designated prior to the date hereof, a description of the job function to be
filled prior to Closing with Buyers consent (such Schedule to be amended at
least 15 days prior to the Closing Date and again within 5 days prior to the

   its Affiliates and is organized pursuant to the Law of the relevant
jurisdiction the amount allocated to such jurisdiction and, if applicable, in
the currency of such jurisdiction, including, without limitation, those
payments described on Annex K, which the parties agree to. To the extent that
the payment described in the preceding sentence is required to be made in the
currency of the relevant jurisdiction, such required payment amount shall be
determined by converting the U.S. dollar amount allocated to such jurisdiction
into the relevant currency at the Currency Exchange Rate, except as set forth
on Annex K. To the extent the parties mutually agree that escrow arrangements

other currencies), as of the close of business on the last Business Day prior
to Closing (i.e., shown as the "previous close" following such Business Day),
between U.S. dollars and the currency of the jurisdiction in which a local
payment is required. The parties hereto covenant and agree to comply with the
provisions set forth in Annex K as if they were set forth in this Agreement
and if any provision of this Agreement and Annex K are in conflict with one
another, the provisions of Annex K shall control.

  

22. Section 2.6(a) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated as follows: 

  

 The Closing shall take place at the offices of Kaye Scholer LLP, 425 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022, New York City time, on April 30, 2007. For purposes of the transfer of title of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Top-Tier Transferred Subsidiaries and the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, the Closing shall be deemed effective as of the time on the Closing Date the parties agree to in writing and unless otherwise provided herein, all references to the Closing shall mean that time on the Closing Date as the parties agree upon; _provided_ , however, that for bookkeeping, tax and accounting purposes and for purposes of Section 5.5 the Closing shall be deemed effective as of 11:59 P.M. on April 30, 2007 in each jurisdiction where such Closing will take place. The date on which the Closing occurs is called the " _Closing Date_ ".

   24. Section 2.8(t) of the Agreement is hereby amended and restated as follows: 

  

 a certificate of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of each Transferred Subsidiary, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, as to the lack of amendments to (i) the certificate of incorporation (or equivalent organizational document) of such Transferred Subsidiary since the date of the certificate referred to in Section 2.8(r) above; and (ii) the bylaws (or equivalent organizational document) of each Transferred Subsidiary; 

  

25. Schedule 2.9(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety by Annex L to this Amendment.

  

26. Section 2.10 of the Agreement is hereby amended to insert the following at the end thereof: 

  

 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller agrees to collect, or cause one of its Subsidiaries to collect, following the Closing, on behalf of Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries, all Accounts Receivable which are Transferred Assets and cannot be transferred to Buyer at Closing. Seller further agrees to pay, or cause one of its Subsidiaries to pay, Buyer or one of its Affiliates, in each case, who would have been entitled to collect such Accounts Receivable had such Accounts Receivable been transferred at Closing, promptly after receipt thereof by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, all income, proceeds and other monies derived from such Accounts Receivable (net of any Taxes (determined as provided below, the "2.10 Taxes") (and any other costs) imposed upon Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any arrangements under this Section 2.10). If the Taxes (as so determined) and other costs imposed upon Seller or any Subsidiary in respect of such Accounts Receivable exceed the income, proceeds and other monies received by Seller or the applicable Subsidiary in respect thereof, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller or the applicable Subsidiary for such excess. To the extent permitted under applicable Tax law, for all Tax purposes the parties shall treat all such Accounts Receivable as having been transferred by Seller (or the Affiliate thereof who held such Accounts Receivable) to Buyer (or the Affiliate thereof who would be entitled to collect such Accounts Receivable had such Accounts Receivable been transferred at Closing) at the Closing. In the event that Seller (or one of its Affiliates) recognizes taxable income after the Closing with respect to or arising from its holding such Accounts Receivables, then the "2.10 Taxes" shall be computed by (i) taking into account that taxable income and any items of deduction or other Tax offset recognized by Seller (or its relevant Affiliate) as a result of holding such Accounts Receivable and the payment to Buyer or its relevant Affiliate required by this Section 2.10 and (ii) determining the net tax cost (or tax savings) resulting from those items as if they were taxable on a stand-alone basis at the highest effective marginal corporate income tax rate for a corporate taxpayer doing business in the relevant jurisdiction where such items are recognized. Buyer may request that any income, proceeds and other monies derived from Accounts Receivable that are to be paid by Seller or one of its Subsidiaries to Buyer or one of its Affiliates pursuant to the preceding four sentences be converted from the currency that is collected by Seller or one of its Subsidiaries into another currency at the Exchange Rate; _provided_ , that any commissions, costs and expenses incurred by Seller or 

   one of its Subsidiaries in converting any income, proceeds and other monies
derived from Accounts Receivable shall be deducted from such income, proceeds
and other monies derived from Accounts Receivable prior to payment to Buyer or
one of its Affiliates. The "Exchange Rate" shall be the NDF Currency Fixings
rate and the LATAM NDF Currency Fixing rate as shown on the NDFF and NDFL
pages on Bloomberg (or other equivalent Bloomberg pages for other currencies),
as of the close of business on the last Business Day prior to payment from
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to Buyer or one of its Affiliates of any
income, proceeds and other monies derived from Accounts Receivable (i.e.,
shown as the "previous close following such Business Day"), between the
currency in which such income, proceeds and other monies are collected by
Seller or one of its Subsidiaries and the currency that Buyer requests, on
behalf of itself or one of its Affiliates, to receive such income, proceeds
and other monies.

  

27. Section 2.14(a) of the Agreement is hereby amended to insert the following at the end thereof:

33. Schedule 3.12 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety by Annex R to this Amendment. 

  

34. Schedule 3.14 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety by Annex S to this Amendment. 

  

35. Schedule 3.18 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety by Annex T to this Amendment. 

  

36. Schedule 3.20 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety by Annex U to this Amendment.

  

37. Section 5.4(a) of the Agreement is hereby amended to insert the following at the end thereof: 

   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.4(a), Buyer shall be permitted to make elections under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect its acquisition of the shares of each of OREX Computed Radiography Ltd ("OREX") and Algotec Systems Limited ("Algotec"). 

  

38. Section 5.4(f) of the Agreement is amended by replacing Sections 5.4(f)(iii) and (iv) with the following and adding a new Section 5.4(f)(vii) as follows and a new Annex V is hereby added to the Agreement in the form of Annex V to this Amendment: 

  

 (iii) _Tax Returns for Transfer Taxes_. Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transaction Transfer Taxes and Reimbursable Value Added Taxes shall be prepared and filed (or caused to be prepared and filed) by the Filing Party. For this purpose, the "Filing __ Party" shall mean the party primarily or customarily responsible (or whose Affiliates are primarily or customarily responsible) under applicable local Law for filing such Tax Returns. The Filing Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party at least 5 Business Days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the allocation of the Purchase Price and the Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to Section 5.4(k) hereof.

  

 (iv) _Payments Due With Tax Returns_. The Filing Party shall promptly pay all Transfer Taxes due with respect to Tax Returns to be filed by such party under this Section 5.4(f). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if Buyer (or an Affiliate thereof) is the Filing Party with respect to any Transfer Tax for which Seller would be otherwise liable hereunder with respect to any Transferred Asset (including any shares of stock), Seller shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Buyer (or one of its Affiliates, as directed by Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.4(f)(iv)) the amount shown as due with respect to such asset on any Tax Return provided by Buyer to Seller with respect to such Transfer Tax no later than 2 Business Days prior to the Transfer Tax Due Date (as defined below) for such Tax if, no later than 5 Business Days prior the Transfer Tax Due Date, Buyer provides Seller (1) a copy of such Tax Return reflecting an amount of Tax payable that is equal to the product of (A) the value of the asset (determined consistently with the allocation of Purchase Price and Consideration as agreed to by the parties and used to determine the amount of Reimbursable Value Added Taxes payable by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.4(f)(vii)) and (B) the rate of such Tax shown in the Microsoft Excel document produced by Ernst and Young LLP, entitled "Project Emerald: Transaction Taxes", dated March 9, 2007 and (2) written payment instructions regarding the manner in which such payment is to be made (including the entity to receive such payment and wire instructions necessary to complete such payment); and once Seller has paid (or caused to be paid) to Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) any such amount in respect of any such Transfer Tax, Buyer shall thereafter be responsible for the payment of that amount of that Transfer Tax, shall not seek to collect such amount from Seller again and shall hold Seller harmless in the event that such amount is not used to pay such Transfer Tax.

   For purposes of the foregoing, the " _Transfer Tax Due Date_ " shall mean, with respect to any Transfer Tax payable by Seller (or an Affiliate thereof) pursuant to this Section 5.4(f)(iv), the date Buyer (or an Affiliate thereof) reasonably determines to file (and certifies to Seller that it will file) such Tax Return in compliance with its obligations to file such Tax Return pursuant to applicable law (but in any event, no later than the final due date for such Tax). The parties shall cooperate to insure all Transaction Transfer Taxes, Reimbursable Value Added Taxes (including any Seller VAT Payment) and any refunds and Recoupments of such amounts shall be borne by and given over to the appropriate party in accordance with Section 5.4(f)(ii). Any Transfer Taxes resulting from any subsequent increase in the Consideration shall be borne in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.4(f) and any Tax Returns required to be filed in connection therewith shall be prepared and filed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.4(f).

  

 (vii) _Payment Procedures for Reimbursable Value Added Tax_. Each of the parties acknowledges that despite the best efforts of the Seller the final balance sheet figures for the Closing Date will not be available as of the Closing Date. Therefore, the parties agree to calculate the Initial VAT as described in this subsection. Without limiting the generality of Buyers obligation to pay and indemnify Seller for Reimbursable Value Added Taxes pursuant to Section 5.4, at the Closing, Seller (and its Affiliates) shall provide Buyer (and its Affiliates) with invoices showing Reimbursable Value Added Taxes due in the amounts and with respect to the assets and jurisdictions listed on Annex V hereto (the " _Initial VAT_ "). For any jurisdiction not listed on Annex V, the Initial VAT shall equal zero. Buyer (together with its Affiliates) shall pay the Initial VAT at the Closing together with and in addition to their payment of the Initial Purchase Price hereunder, in each case in the manner set forth in this Section 5.4(f)(vii). All Initial VAT paid by Buyer shall be paid directly to Seller, except that, if any Initial VAT is being charged with respect to assets in a jurisdiction in which the portion of the Initial Purchase Price allocated to that jurisdiction is being paid (pursuant to Section 2.5(b)) by Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) to an Affiliate of Seller that is organized under the laws of such jurisdiction, such Initial VAT shall be paid directly to local Seller Affiliate together with and in addition to the portion of the Initial Purchase Price being paid to such local Seller Affiliate and shall be paid in the currency in which such portion of the Initial Purchase Price is being paid (pursuant to Section 2.5(b)). With respect to any jurisdiction or assets for which Seller (or its Affiliate) has not provided Buyer (or its Affiliate) with an invoice showing the amount of Initial VAT due within 15 days (or such shorter period mandated by relevant law) after the Closing Date and, as a result of Buyers not receiving such invoice, payments of VAT made by Buyer (or its Affiliates) to Seller (or its Affiliates) do not qualify as Reimbursable Value Added Tax, then Seller promptly shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to) reimburse Buyer for the amount of such payment that no longer so qualifies. 

  

 Within 30 days after the Closing Date (or such shorter time as required by applicable law), Buyer shall provide to Seller a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction schedule (and, where required by applicable law, an asset by asset schedule) setting forth, for each jurisdiction in which the Transferred Assets were located prior to Closing, the amount of Reimbursable Value Added Tax that would have been payable by Buyer with respect to such assets on the Closing on the basis of the value of such assets set forth on the balance sheets of Seller (and its Affiliates) dated as of the Closing Date (such amounts, as agreed by the parties pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.4(f)(vii), the " _Closing Date VAT_ "). 

   If Seller notifies Buyer of its disagreement with any item reflected on such schedule within 5 days of receipt thereof, Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve the disputed items. To the extent Seller and Buyer resolve any such disputed items, such schedule shall be revised to reflect the agreed amounts. To the extent Seller and Buyer cannot resolve any disputed items within 10 days after Buyer delivers such schedules to Seller, then Seller and Buyer shall jointly submit the disputed items for resolution to the New York City office of an independent "Big Four" accounting firm (or other accounting firm) mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer. The decision of such accounting firm with respect to the disputed items shall be rendered within 10 days after such firm is retained and shall be final and binding on Seller and Buyer and the schedule shall be revised to reflect such decision. Seller and Buyer shall share equally the costs of employing such accounting firm. To the extent that, for any specific jurisdiction, the Closing Date VAT is greater than the Initial VAT, Seller shall charge Buyer for Reimbursable Value Added Tax in an amount equal to the difference and Buyer shall promptly pay such additional amount in accordance the foregoing procedures for, and in the same jurisdiction and the same currency as applicable in, paying the Initial VAT. To the extent that, for any specific jurisdiction, the Initial VAT is greater than the Closing Date VAT, Seller shall credit Reimbursable Value Added Tax in an amount equal to the difference (an "Overpayment") and shall, upon receiving reimbursement of such amount from the relevant taxing authorities (whether through refund, offset or credit against any other liability), promptly pay back such previously charged Initial VAT to Buyer or whichever Affiliate of Buyer paid the Initial VAT, together with any interest received by Seller (or any of its Affiliates) from such taxing authority with respect to reimbursed Initial VAT. Twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date Seller shall give notice to Buyer identifying any Overpayment or portion thereof with respect to which either (i) the relevant Taxing authority has denied Sellers claim for such reimbursement or (ii) no determination as to the claim for such reimbursement has been made by the relevant Taxing authority (the Overpayment or portion thereof described in this clause (ii), a "Unresolved Overpayment"). Buyer and Seller shall jointly request from an independent "Big Four" accounting firm (or other accounting firm) mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller an opinion that it is more likely than not that such Unresolved Overpayment constitutes Reimbursable Value Added Tax. If such independent accounting firm fails to render such an opinion, then Seller shall pay to Buyer 50% of the amount of the Unresolved Overpayment, and neither party shall thereafter be entitled to payment from the other for any amounts so reimbursed by any Taxing authority with respect to such Unresolved Overpayment. Nothing in the two immediately preceding sentences shall affect the parties respective rights to reimbursement from the other under this Agreement in a case in which Seller has claimed and obtained such a reimbursement with respect to any Overpayment prior to the end of such two-year period and the applicable Taxing authority subsequently asserts that such reimbursement was improper. Any Reimbursable Value Added Tax not subject to the provisions of this Section 5.4(f)(vii) shall be subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.4(f). To the extent that any Local APA defines the purchase price for such assets by reference, in whole or in part, to the amount of VAT payable with respect thereto, then such Local APA shall be interpreted in a manner that allows the transactions contemplated by such Local APA to close on the Closing Date upon payment of the purchase price calculated by reference to the Initial VAT relevant to such transactions.

   39. Schedule 5.4 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is hereby deleted and replaced in its entirety by Annex W to this Amendment, and Section 5.4 of the Agreement is hereby amended to insert the following at the end thereof: 

  

Section 5.4(q) _Certain Withholding Taxes_.

  

 (i) In the event that either Buyer or Seller determines that Buyer (or an Affiliate thereof) may be required by the applicable Law in any particular jurisdiction to withhold from the Initial Purchase Price or from any payment made pursuant to Section 2.13 any Taxes (other than any Transfer Taxes (including, without limitation, any value added taxes)) or other amount in respect of any potential Tax obligation of Seller, such party shall notify the other of such potential obligation. Following receipt of each such notice, each party shall cooperate diligently and in good faith (and shall cause their respective advisors and employees to cooperate diligently and in good faith) to reach a mutual agreement as to whether any such Taxes or other amounts are required to be withheld and, if so, the availability of any exemptions, exceptions or reductions and, if appropriate, the amount of any such required withholding. To the extent that any exemption, exception, or reduction of any such withholding tax depends on the reliance by a party on any certification, representation, notice or other statement by the other party, then such other party indemnifies and holds harmless the relying party for any liability, loss or damage resulting from any inaccuracy contained in such certification, representation, notice or other statement. If the parties agree that any exemptions, exceptions or reductions are available, the parties shall (and shall cause their respective advisors and employees to) cooperate diligently and in good faith so that all reasonable steps are taken in order to qualify for any such exemption, exception or reduction. To the extent that the parties do not agree that any such exemption, exception or reduction is available (or qualified for), Buyer (or its Subsidiary) shall (i) withhold from the Initial Purchase Price or the payment made pursuant to Section 2.13, as applicable, the amount the parties have agreed is required by such Law, (ii) pay the amount withheld directly and promptly (and in all events prior to the due date) to the appropriate Taxing authority), and (iii) provide Seller with proof in any form or forms that Seller reasonably requests evidencing that such amount has been properly and promptly paid to the appropriate Taxing authority. Any amount withheld from the Initial Purchase Price or any amount paid pursuant to Section 2.13 in accordance with the terms of the immediately preceding sentence shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as if it had been paid directly to Seller as a part of the Initial Purchase Price or the amount required to be paid pursuant to Section 2.13, as the case may be.

  

 (ii) _Israeli Escrow For Withholding Tax_. 

  

 Buyer acknowledges that Seller has presented Buyer with a letter from the Israeli taxing authority stating that a payment of US$9.9 million to the Seller Affiliates Trustee 

   (as described below) will satisfy any obligation that Buyer or its Affiliate
might have had under Israeli law to withhold from the purchase price.
Accordingly, (i) Buyer will not withhold or pay over to the Israeli taxing
authority any amount in respect of Israeli withholding taxes from the portion
of the Initial Purchase Price to be paid for the shares in Orex and Algotec;
(ii) Buyer will instead deduct US$9.9 million from that portion of the Initial
Purchase Price; and (iii) Buyer will pay such sum to David Schottenfels, Ben-
Zvi Koren and Co., Law Offices, as Trustee for the Seller Affiliate that is
selling the shares of Orex and Algotec.

  

Section 5.4(r) _Italian Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  

 (i) Due to frequent changes in the HG Business assets in Kodak Italy, the portion of the Initial Purchase Price allocated to the purchase by Buyer of the quotas of Carestream Health Italia s.r.l. (the " _Italy PPA_ ") will be adjusted after the Closing so that the price, expressed in Euros, is equal to the greater of: (i) 110 million Euros and (ii) the Italy Closing Book Value (expressed in Euros) plus 21 million Euros, but in no event will the revised purchase price exceed the "Initial Euro Payment." The Initial Euro Payment minus this adjusted price (in Euros) is the "Euro Reduction." 

  

 (ii) The "Initial Euro Payment" equals the Italy PPA translated from U.S. dollars into Euros at the Euro Exchange Rate (defined below) on April 27, 2007 (i.e., the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date). "Italy Closing Book Value" means the net book value in Euros of the assets contributed to Carestream Health Italia s.r.l. on the Closing Date, as determined no later than 30 days after the Closing Date by the parties cooperating diligently and in good faith. 

  

 (iii) Any Euro Reduction in the Italy PPA will be translated from Euros into U.S. dollars at the Euro Exchange Rate on the last Business Day before the adjustment payments described in this paragraph are made, and that U.S. dollar amount will be re-allocated as follows: (1) 50% to the amount paid for the shares of PW-US and (2) 50% to the amount paid for other Transferred Assets in the U.S. Promptly after such re-allocation of the Euro Reduction, Kodak shall cause Kodak Italy to pay the Euro Reduction to the Buyer in Euros and, on the same day, Buyer shall pay the same amount to Seller in U.S. dollars, translated from Euros to U.S. dollars at the Euro Exchange Rate on the last Business Day before the adjustment payments are made. These adjustments (in U.S. dollars) will be reflected on a revised Schedule 5.4(k) which will thereafter govern for all purposes. 

  

 (iv) For those purposes, the Euro Exchange Rate shall mean the rate shown on Bloomberg under page EUCFUSD (Euro Exchange US), Index HP.

 (i) On the day after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause each Transferred Subsidiary to provide a schedule with supporting bank statements setting forth the cash remaining in such Transferred Subsidiary as of the Closing and the Excluded Cash remaining in such Transferred Subsidiary as of the Closing, with the determination of such remaining cash and Excluded Cash to be made as of 11:59 P.M. local time on the Closing Date of the location of each Transferred Subsidiary. If Seller notifies Buyer of its disagreement with any items reflected on the schedules so provided within 5 days of receipt thereof, Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve the disputed items. To the extent Seller and Buyer resolve any such disputed items, the schedules shall be revised to reflect the agreed amounts. To the extent Seller and Buyer cannot resolve any disputed items within 10 days after Buyer delivers such schedules to Seller, then Seller and Buyer shall jointly submit the disputed items for resolution to the New York City office of an independent "Big Four" accounting firm (or such other accounting firm) mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer.

" _Buyer Cash_ " means any cash contributed or paid by Buyer or one of its Affiliates to a Transferred Subsidiary prior to Closing. 

  

 (ii) Within 5 business days after the schedules are finalized in accordance with this Section 5.7(b), Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller the total amount by which the cash remaining as so determined exceeds the Excluded Cash. 

  

 (iii) Notwithstanding the specific provisions relating to the Israeli Cash set forth in Section 5.7(c), any cash remaining in OREX and Algotec shall be taken into account in applying this Section 5.7(b). 

  

 (iv) On July 1, 2007, Buyer shall cause each Transferred Subsidiary to provide a schedule with supporting bank statements setting forth the interest amount attributable to the period prior to the Closing (and not paid or credited to the Transferred Subsidiary at or prior to the Closing) with respect to the cash in such Transferred Subsidiary as of the Closing or at any time prior to the Closing (other than the Excluded Cash remaining in such Transferred Subsidiary), which interest amount had not been reflected on the schedule contemplated by Section 5.7(b)(i) or 5.7(b)(ii) because it was not paid or credited to a Transferred Subsidiary on or prior to the preparation of the schedule contemplated by Section 5.7(b)(i) or Section 5.7(b)(ii) (" _Unreported Interest_ "). If Seller notifies Buyer of its disagreement with any Unreported Interest amount on the schedules so provided within 5 days of receipt thereof, Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve the disputed items. To the extent Seller and Buyer resolve any such disputed items, the schedules shall be revised to reflect the agreed amounts. To the extent Seller and Buyer 

   cannot resolve any disputed items within 10 days after Buyer delivers such
schedules to Seller, then Seller and Buyer shall jointly submit the disputed
items for resolution to the New York City office of an independent "Big Four"
accounting firm (or such other accounting firm) mutually agreed upon by Seller
and Buyer. The decision of such accounting firm with respect to the disputed
items shall be rendered within 10 days after such firm is retained and shall
be final and binding on Seller and Buyer and the schedules shall be revised to
reflect such decision. Seller and Buyer shall share equally the costs of
employing such accounting firm. Within 5 business days after the schedules are
finalized in accordance with this Section 5.7(b)(iv), Buyer shall pay or cause
to be paid to Seller the total Unreported Interest amount.

Affiliate thereof purchased from Seller and Eastman Kodak Holdings B.V. all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Medical Flow Solutions S.A. for a
purchase price of US $10,000.

  

The parties agree that, immediately after that purchase, Medical Flow
Solutions S.A. should have held US $10,000 in cash, but if Buyer determines
that the amount of cash in Medical Flow Solutions S.A. at such time was less
than such amount, Buyer shall deliver a certificate to Seller, including a
bank statement detailing the amount of cash that Medical Flow Solutions S.A.
had at such time, stating the amount of such deficiency; and Seller shall pay
the amount of such deficiency to Buyer within five days of such delivery. Any
portion of the US$10,000 of cash that is in Medical Flow Solutions S.A. on the
Closing Date will be treated as Excluded Cash for purposes of Section 5.7(b)
and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, is a
Transferred Asset for all purposes of the Agreement.

Flow Solutions S.A. shall pay in U.S. dollars from its bank account in New
York City to Kodak Argentina S.A.I.C. by transfer into Kodak Argentina

Carestream Health Colombia Ltda. will pay an amount of 6,504,083,440 Colombian

allocated to the Transferred Assets in Colombia as set forth on Schedule 5.4
(as expressed in U.S. dollars the "Colombia PP"); plus, the Initial VAT
relating to the Transferred Assets in Colombia (in Colombian pesos as set
forth on Annex V).

   _True-Up or True-Down._ Because this Colombian pesos payment, less such
amount of Initial VAT (the "Colombian Peso Payment"), may not have a U.S.
dollar value, using the U.S. dollar/Colombian pesos Currency Exchange Rate on
April 27, 2007 ( _i.e._ , the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date),
equal to Colombia PP, the following will occur at the Closing:

  

 if the Colombian Pesos Payment, translated into U.S. Dollars using the April 27, 2007 U.S. Dollar/Colombian pesos Currency Exchange Rate (x) exceeds the Colombia PP, then the amount the Buyer pays to the Seller in U.S. dollars on the Closing Date will be reduced by such excess or (y) is less than the Colombia PP, then the amount the Buyer pays to the Seller in U.S. dollars on the Closing Date will be increased by such deficiency.

Kodak India Limited at the opening of business on the next Business Day in
India after the Closing.

Carestream Health India Private Limited will pay an amount of Indian rupees
(the "Indian Rupee Payment") from its bank account in India into Kodak India

number of Indian rupees that Buyer estimated in advance would be necessary to
pay the Initial Purchase Price allocated to the Transferred Assets in India as
set forth on Schedule 5.4 (expressed in U.S. dollars the "Indian PP").

  

 _True-Up or True-Down._ Because this Indian Rupee Payment may not have a U.S.
dollar value, using the U.S. Dollar/Indian rupee Currency Exchange Rate on
April 27, 2007 ( _i.e._ , the last Business Day prior to the Closing Date),
equal to the Indian PP, the following will occur at the Closing:

  

 if the Indian Rupee Payment, translated into U.S. Dollars using the April 27, 2007 U.S. Dollar/Indian rupee Currency Exchange Rate (x) exceeds the Indian PP, then the amount the Buyer pays to Seller in U.S. dollars on the Closing Date will be reduced by such excess or (y) is less than the Indian PP, then the amount the Buyer pays to the Seller in U.S. dollars on the Closing Date will be increased by such deficiency.

that the aggregate amount of cash in the Mexico Newcos at such time was less
than such amount, Buyer shall deliver a certificate to Seller including bank
statements detailing the amount of cash that the Mexican Newcos had at such
time, stating the amount of such deficiency; and Seller shall pay the amount

Schedule 3.20 
_Warranties/Product Liability_

    1. |  | _Artifacts on CR Screens_. The percentage of returns
of installed CR screens has seen a year over year increase. The screens have
been returned with reports of artifacts appearing on the screens. The research
and development team has identified chemical contamination of the screens as
the cause of many of these artifacts. The chemical contamination appears to be
the result of handling and cleaning processes used by the customers. An
overcoat has been designed which appears to address the majority of these
artifact issues, and appears to have resulted in a significant decrease in the
number of returned screens. Customers are being reminded of proper handling
and cleaning techniques. 
---|---|--- 
   
  2. |  | _IRIX 70 Scissor Arm_. The articulating arms on wall mounted
x-ray generators manufactured by predecessors of Trophy have failed in
sufficient numbers in the past to warrant a previous recall by a predecessor
of Trophy of the products manufactured within a particular interval, a recall
which has been closed and signed off on by the FDA and other regulatory
agencies. Currently, management is evaluating another recall, this time for
products manufactured during a subsequent interval. There are no issues with
respect to these products manufactured since 1997. 
   
  3. |  | _CR Screens_. There appears to be premature wear of a coating
on the reverse side of the Kodak screens used in our Point of Care CR systems
(Orex) which causes debris to be deposited on the front of the screen,
impacting image quality. Preliminary review indicates that a recall or other
market action is not likely. 
   
  4. |  | _Kodak DirectView DR 7500 and Kodak DirectView DR 3000_. FDA
regulation for diagnostic x-ray systems, 21 CFR 1020.31 (e) require "the beam-
limiting device shall numerically indicate the field size in the plane of the
image receptor to which it is adjusted ". The DR system software does not
display this information, nor are there labels on the beam-limiting device
(collimator) that displays the information. FDA classified this correction as
a Class II recall. For 28 DR 7500 and 9 DR 3000 units in the U.S. Kodak Field
Service engineers will conduct a Mandatory Service Modification to apply
directly to the collimator dial indicator label and field size label. For 80
DR 7500 and 68 DR 3000 units outside the U.S., service modification
instructions were provided to Kodak or appropriate local (non-Kodak) service
providers.
