                   MERGER AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

        MERGER AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION, dated as of August 3, 2000,
by and among Broadcom Corporation, a California corporation ("Broadcom"),
Silicon Spice Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"), and, with respect
to Article 7 and Article 9 only, James Wei as Shareholder Agent and U.S. Stock
Transfer Corporation, as Depositary Agent. Capitalized terms used and not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in Article 10.

                                    RECITALS

        A. The Boards of Directors of each of Broadcom and the Company believe
it is in the best interests of Broadcom and the Company (as applicable) and
their respective shareholders that Broadcom acquire the Company through the
merger of the Company with and into Broadcom (the "Merger") and, in furtherance
thereof, have approved the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

        B. Prior to the Effective Time, all outstanding shares of Company
Preferred Stock will be converted into outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock.

        C. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, (i) all of the shares of Company Common Stock
which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger shall be converted into the right to receive shares of Class A common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Broadcom ("Broadcom Common Stock"), and
(ii) all Company Options, Company Warrants and Company Stock Purchase Rights
then outstanding (whether vested or unvested) will become exercisable for
Broadcom Common Stock, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein.

        D. As a condition and an inducement to the willingness of Broadcom to
enter into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company have concurrently
herewith entered into (i) Support Agreements with Broadcom in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A ("Support Agreements") pursuant to which,
among other things, such shareholders have agreed to vote the shares of Company
Capital Stock owned by them in favor of the Merger and to convert, prior to the
Effective Time, the shares of Company Preferred Stock owned by them, if any,
into shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) Company Affiliate Agreements in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B ("Company Affiliate
Agreements").

        E. As a condition and a further inducement to Broadcom to enter into
this Agreement, certain employees of the Company have entered into
Non-Competition Agreements substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
C (the "Non-Competition Agreements"), each of which shall become effective at
the Effective Time.

        F. Broadcom and the Company intend that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code, and in furtherance thereof intend that this Agreement shall be a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354(a) and 361(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code.


                                       1
<PAGE>   8

        G. The Company and Broadcom desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger.

        H. A portion of the shares of Broadcom Common Stock otherwise issuable
or reserved for issuance by Broadcom in connection with the Merger shall be
placed in escrow by Broadcom, the release of which amount shall be contingent
upon certain events and conditions, all as set forth in Article 7 herein.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises,
representations and warranties set forth herein, intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                   THE MERGER

        1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the California
Code, the Company shall be merged with and into Broadcom, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall cease, and Broadcom shall continue as the
surviving corporation. Broadcom is sometimes referred to herein as the
"Surviving Corporation."

        1.2 Effective Time. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant
to Section 8.1, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place as
promptly as practicable, but no later than two (2) Business Days following
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 6, at the offices
of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, 2200 Geng Road, Palo Alto, California,
unless another place or time is agreed to by Broadcom and the Company. The date
upon which the Closing actually occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing
Date." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a California Agreement of Merger (or like instrument), in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Agreement of Merger"),
with the Secretary of State of the State of California, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of applicable law (the time of acceptance by the Secretary
of State of the State of California of such filing or such later time as may be
agreed to by the parties and set forth in the Agreement of Merger being referred
to herein as the "Effective Time").

        1.3 Effect of the Merger on Constituent Corporations. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions
of the California Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of Broadcom and the Company shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities
and duties of Broadcom and the Company shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

        1.4 Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of Surviving Corporation.

               (a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of
Broadcom, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
as provided by law and such articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.


                                       2
<PAGE>   9

               (b) The bylaws of Broadcom, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by such bylaws, the articles of incorporation and
applicable law.

        1.5 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The directors of
Broadcom immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Broadcom
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

        1.6 Maximum Number of Shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be Issued;
Effect on Outstanding Securities of the Company. The maximum number of shares of
Broadcom Common Stock to be issued (including Broadcom Common Stock to be
reserved for issuance upon exercise of any of the Company Options, Company
Warrants or Company Stock Purchase Rights to be assumed by Broadcom as provided
herein) in exchange for the acquisition by Broadcom of all shares of Company
Capital Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and all vested and unvested Company Options, Company Warrants and
Company Stock Purchase Rights which are then outstanding (other than Company
Warrants which by their terms expire without payment, conversion, adjustment or
other consideration at the Effective Time) shall not exceed the Aggregate Share
Number. Except as expressly provided in Section 1.8 and Section 10.1, no
adjustment shall be made in the number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock issued
in the Merger as a result of any consideration (in any form whatsoever) received
by the Company from the date hereof to the Effective Time as a result of any
exercise, conversion or exchange of Company Options, Company Warrants or Company
Stock Purchase Rights. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Broadcom, the Company or the holder of any shares of the Company
Capital Stock or Company Options, Company Warrants or Company Stock Purchase
Rights, the following shall occur:

               (a) Conversion of Company Capital Stock. Each share of Company
Common Stock (assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of Company
Preferred Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 1.6(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as provided in Section 1.10)) shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive, following the expiration or
early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act which is applicable to
the holder of such share, that number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal
to the Exchange Ratio.

               (b) Cancellation of Broadcom-Owned and Company-Owned Stock. Each
share of Company Common Stock owned by Broadcom or the Company or any Subsidiary
of Broadcom or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and
without any further action on the part of Broadcom or the Company.

               (c) Capital Stock of Broadcom. Each share of Broadcom Common
Stock and each share of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
Broadcom, which is


                                       3
<PAGE>   10

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding as one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the
same class of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, with identical rights
and privileges. From and after the Effective Time, each share certificate of
Broadcom theretofore evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to
evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

               (d) Company Options and Company Stock Plan. All unexpired and
unexercised Company Options and Company Stock Purchase Rights, then outstanding,
whether vested or unvested, together with the Company Stock Plan, shall be
assumed by Broadcom in accordance with provisions set forth below.

                      (i) Each unexpired and unexercised Company Option, and
Company Stock Purchase Right then outstanding, whether vested or unvested, shall
be, in connection with the Merger, assumed by Broadcom, together with the
Company Stock Plan. Each Company Option and Company Stock Purchase Right so
assumed by Broadcom under this Agreement shall, except as provided in Section
1.6(d)(iii), continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such Company Option or Company Stock Purchase Right
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or
vesting provisions), provided that (A) such Company Option or Company Stock
Purchase Right, as the case may be, shall be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal to the product of the number of
shares of Company Capital Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company
Option, or Company Stock Purchase Right immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Broadcom Common Stock) and (B) the per share exercise price for the
shares of Broadcom Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Option or Company Stock Purchase Right, as the case may be, shall be equal to
the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Capital Stock at which such Company Option or Company Stock Purchase Right was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent). It is the intention of the parties that
the Company Options assumed by Broadcom shall qualify, following the Effective
Time, as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code to the same extent the Company Options qualified as incentive stock
options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the provisions of this
Section 1.6(d) shall be applied consistent with this intent.

                      (ii) Broadcom shall assume the Company's obligations, and
shall be assigned the Company's repurchase rights and purchase options, under
any Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements entered into pursuant to the 1996 Stock
Option Plan (the "Company Stock Plan") and the other restricted stock purchase
agreements listed on Schedule 1.6(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
true and correct copies of which have been made available by the Company to
Broadcom. Except as provided in Section 1.6(d)(iii), any and all restrictions on
the Company Restricted Stock issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plan or such
other agreements which do not lapse in accordance with their terms (as in effect
on June 30, 2000) shall continue in full force and effect until such
restrictions lapse pursuant to the terms of such agreements, and any repurchase
rights or repurchase options which the Company has with respect to the Company
Restricted Stock shall also continue in full force and effect.


                                       4
<PAGE>   11

                      (iii) The Company agrees to take all actions necessary or
advisable to cause all Company Options, Company Stock Purchase Rights and
Company Restricted Stock to remain unchanged except (A) for the conversion into
options, warrants or rights to purchase shares of Broadcom Common Stock as
provided for in this Section 1.6(d), (B) that any acceleration of vesting,
continuation of vesting after termination of employment or other special vesting
(whether with the passage of time, upon the occurrence of certain events or
otherwise) that might occur, result from or be related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall be prevented
from occurring through the modification, in a manner acceptable to Broadcom, of
the applicable Company Option, Company Stock Purchase Right or Company

to clause (B) of this Section 1.6(d)(iii).

                      (iv) If any Company Warrant shall remain unexpired and
unexercised at the Effective Time, it shall continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Warrant

for that number of whole shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal to the product of
(I) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise of such Company Warrant (or, in the case of Company Warrants
exercisable for Company Preferred Stock, upon exercise of such Company Warrant
and conversion of the resulting Company Preferred Stock into Company Common
Stock) immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (II) the Exchange
Ratio (with such product rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Broadcom Common Stock) and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Broadcom Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant shall be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing (I) the exercise price per share of

adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock
combination, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Broadcom Common Stock or Company Capital Stock),
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to Broadcom Common Stock or Company Capital Stock the effective date of
which occurs after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

        1.9 Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Broadcom Common Stock
will be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share
of Broadcom Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Broadcom
Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall be entitled to receive from
Broadcom an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
product of (a) such fraction, multiplied by (b) the Closing Price.

        1.10 Dissenting Shares.

               (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded
and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the California
Code and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost
such appraisal or dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive Broadcom Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are
granted by the California Code.

               (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.10(a), if any
holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such shares
under the California Code shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive Broadcom
Common Stock as provided in Section 1.6, without interest thereon, upon
surrender to the Company of the certificate representing such shares in
accordance with Section 1.11.

               (c) The Company shall give Broadcom (i) prompt notice of its
receipt of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital
Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments relating to the
Merger served pursuant to the California Code and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the California Code. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Broadcom or as may be required
under applicable law, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal of Company Capital Stock or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

        1.11 Exchange Procedures.

               (a) Broadcom Common Stock. On the Closing Date, Broadcom shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article 1,
the aggregate number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock issuable in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, and cash in an amount sufficient to
permit the payment of cash in lieu of fractional


                                       6
<PAGE>   13

shares pursuant to Section 1.9; provided, however, that, on behalf of the
holders of Company Capital Stock, Broadcom shall deposit into an escrow account
a number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal to the Escrow Amount. The
portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each holder of Company
Capital Stock shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of
Broadcom Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
by virtue of ownership of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock or right
to acquire shares of Company Capital Stock, as the case may be.

               (b) Exchange Procedures. Within five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each
holder of record a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the
"Certificates") and which shares were converted into the right to receive shares
of Broadcom Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates, shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Broadcom may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Broadcom Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional
shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Broadcom, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole
shares of Broadcom Common Stock (less the number of shares of Broadcom Common
Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to
Article 7), to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6 and cash in
lieu of fractional shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
1.9, and the Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Broadcom shall cause
payments to be made to each shareholder of the Company within five (5) Business
Days after the later of (i) confirmation of filing of the Agreement of Merger
from the California Secretary of State and (ii) the Exchange Agent's receipt of
such shareholder's Certificate(s). As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article 7,
Broadcom shall cause to be distributed to the Depositary Agent a certificate or
certificates (in such denominations as may be requested by the Depositary Agent)
representing that number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock equal to the Escrow
Amount, which certificate shall be registered in the name of the Depositary
Agent. Such shares shall be beneficially owned by the holders on whose behalf
such shares were deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be available to
compensate Broadcom as provided in Article 7. Until surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of
Company Capital Stock, will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the
ownership of the number of full shares of Broadcom Common Stock into which such
shares of Company Capital Stock, shall have been so converted (subject only to,
if applicable, the expiration or early termination of any waiting period under
the HSR Act which is applicable to the holder of such shares) and cash in lieu
of fractional shares.

               (c) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Company
Capital Stock. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Broadcom
Common Stock declared or made after the Effective Time and with a record date
after the Effective Time will be paid to the


                                       7
<PAGE>   14

holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Broadcom
Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Broadcom Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.11(c)) with
respect to such whole shares of Broadcom Common Stock.

               (d) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate for shares of
Broadcom Common Stock is to be issued pursuant to this Agreement in a name other
than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate
so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Broadcom
or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a certificate for shares of Broadcom Common Stock in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Broadcom or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

        1.12 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. All shares of
Broadcom Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash in
lieu of fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Company of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article 1.

        1.13 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
certificates evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue certificates representing
such shares of Broadcom Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof; provided, however, that Broadcom
or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to provide an indemnity or deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Broadcom or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

        1.14 Exemption From Registration; California Permit. The shares of
Broadcom Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6 in connection with
the Merger will be issued in a transaction exempt from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act"), by reason of Section 3(a)(10)
thereof. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.1(c), Broadcom and the Company
intend that the shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and

Stock

Purchase Rights required by this Agreement to be assumed by Broadcom will be
qualified under the California Code, pursuant to Section 25121 thereof, after a
fairness hearing has been held by the Commissioner of Corporations of the State
of California pursuant to the authority granted by Section 25142 of such law
(the "Fairness Hearing"). Broadcom, with the full cooperation of the Company,
shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to file within ten (10) Business
Days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement an application for
issuance of a permit pursuant to Section 25121 of the California Code to qualify
the shares of Broadcom to be issued in the Merger and the assumption of the
Company Options, Company Warrants and Company Stock Purchase Rights required by
this Agreement to be assumed by Broadcom (the "California Permit") and (ii) to
obtain the California Permit as soon as practicable thereafter.

        1.15 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company, or to effect the assignment to the
Surviving Corporation of any and all Company Intellectual Property created by a
founder, employee or consultant of the Company (including any related
Intellectual Property created by any of the Company's founders prior to the
creation of the Company), or to complete and prosecute all domestic and foreign
patent filings related to such Company Intellectual Property, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized to take, and will
take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not

may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

obligation or liability whatsoever other than any obligation or liability
relating to any claim based on events arising on or before the Closing and any
administrative expenses associated with terminating or maintaining any such
Plan, whether on behalf of any of the current employees of the Company or on
behalf of any other person, after the Closing, or (B) which the Surviving
Corporation will not be able to terminate immediately after the Closing in

               (b) Present Value of Benefits.

        The present value of all accrued benefits under any Plan subject to

applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA, and each such Plan

Laws.

               (c) Penalties; Reportable Events.

        Neither the Company, nor any of its ERISA Affiliates is subject to any
material liability, tax or penalty whatsoever to any person or agency whomsoever
as a result of engaging in a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code, and neither the Company, nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any
knowledge of any circumstances which reasonably might result in any material
liability, tax or penalty, including a penalty under Section 502 of ERISA, as a
result of a breach of any duty under ERISA or under other Laws. Each Plan which
is required to comply with the provisions of Sections 4980B and 4980C of the
Internal Revenue Code, or with the requirements referred to in Section 4980D of
the Internal Revenue Code, has complied in all material respects. No event has
occurred which could subject any Plan to tax under Section 511 of the Internal
Revenue Code. None of the Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA has, since
September 2, 1974, been completely or partially terminated nor has there been
any "reportable event," as such term is defined in Section 4043(b) of ERISA,
with respect to any of the Plans since the effective date of ERISA nor has any
notice of intent to terminate been filed or given with respect to any such Plan.

the Company, or any of its ERISA Affiliates of operations at a facility causing

ERISA Affiliates, nor any other organization of which any of them are a
successor corporation, as defined in Section 4069(b) of ERISA, have engaged in
any transaction described in Section 4069(a) of ERISA.

               (d) Deficiencies; Qualification.

        None of the Plans nor any trust created thereunder has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" as such term is defined in Section 412 of the
Internal Revenue Code, whether or not waived, since the effective date of said
section, and no condition has occurred or exists which by the passage of time
could be expected to result in an accumulated funding deficiency as of the last
day of the current plan year of any such Plan. Furthermore, neither the Company
nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any unfunded liability under ERISA in
respect of


                                       21
<PAGE>   28

any of the Plans. Each of the Plans which is intended to be a qualified plan
under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable
determination letter, opinion, notification or advisory letter from the Internal
Revenue Service or has time remaining to apply for a favorable determination
letter, opinion, notification or advisory letter from the Internal Revenue
Service, and has been operated in substantial compliance with and in accordance
with its terms. All of the Plans have been administered and maintained in
substantial compliance with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code and all other
applicable Laws. All contributions required to be made to each of the Plans
under the terms of that Plan, ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any other
applicable Laws have been timely made. Each Plan intended to meet the
requirements for tax-favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of the
Internal Revenue Code is in material compliance with such requirements. There
are no Liens against any Assets or Properties of the Company or any of its ERISA
Affiliates under Section 412(n) of the Internal Revenue Code or Sections 302(f)
or 4068 of ERISA. The Interim Financial Statements properly reflect all amounts
required to be accrued as liabilities to date of such Financial Statements under
each of the Plans.

               (e) Acceleration.

        Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or further acts or events) will (i) result
in any obligation or liability (with respect to accrued benefits or otherwise)
on the part of the Company, Broadcom, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to the PBGC, to any Plan, or to any present or former
employee, director, officer, shareholder, contractor or consultant of (or any of
their dependents) Broadcom, the Surviving Corporation, or any their respective
Subsidiaries, (ii) be a trigger event under any Plan that will result in any
payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due to any such present
or former employee, officer, director, shareholder, contractor, or consultant or
any of their dependents, or (iii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount, of any compensation theretofore or thereafter due or
granted to any employee, officer, director, shareholder, contractor, or
consultant of the Company or any of their dependents. With respect to any
insurance policy which provides, or has provided, funding for benefits under any
Plan, (A) there is and will be no liability of the Company, Broadcom, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in the nature of a
retroactive or retrospective rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement, or
actual or contingent liability as of the Closing Date, nor would there be any
such liability if such insurance policy were terminated as of the Closing Date,
and (B) no insurance company issuing any such policy is in receivership,
conservatorship, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such proceedings with respect to any insurer are,
to the knowledge of the Company, imminent.

               (f) COBRA.

        With respect to each Plan which provides health care coverage, the

               (i) Each item of Company Registered Intellectual Property is
valid and subsisting, and all necessary registration, maintenance, renewal fees,
annuity fees and taxes in connection with such Registered Intellectual Property
have been paid and all necessary documents and certificates in connection with

               (o) The Company has taken all actions necessary and appropriate
to assure that there shall be no material adverse change to its business or
electronic systems or material interruptions in the delivery of the Company's
products and services by reason of the advent of the year 2000, including that
all of its products (including products currently under development) will,
without interruption or manual intervention, continue to consistently,
predictably and accurately record, store, process, calculate and present
calendar dates falling on and after (and if applicable, spans of time including)
January 1, 2000, and will consistently, predictably and accurately calculate any
information dependent on or relating to such dates in the same manner, and with
the same functionality, data integrity and performance, as such products record,

arisen in connection therewith) and (ii) the Company has made inquiries of the
suppliers listed in Section 2.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule as to the
status of their Year 2000 efforts and as a result thereof has not uncovered any
problems that could materially disrupt or harm the day-to-day functioning of
business and operations of the Company.

               (p) Neither this Agreement nor any transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will result in Broadcom's granting any rights or licenses with

Contract to which the Company is a party or by which any of its Assets and
Properties are bound.

               (q) Section 2.17(q) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth

               (r) The Company's products comply in all material respects with
the applicable standards and with the feature specifications and performance
standards set forth in Section 2.17(r) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. There
are no outstanding claims (or facts that may reasonably lead to a claim) for
breach of warranties by the Company in connection with the foregoing. All
product performance comparisons heretofore furnished by the Company to customers
or Broadcom are accurate in all material respects as of the dates so furnished
(except that, in the case of product performance comparisons made as of a
specified earlier date, such comparisons shall be accurate as of such specified
earlier date, and, in the case of product performance comparisons superseded by
a subsequent product performance comparison furnished to the customer before the
customer's acquisition of a license on the product covered by the superseded
comparison, the superseding comparison shall be accurate in all material
respects and the superseded comparison shall be disregarded).

<PAGE>   34

of the Company Intellectual Property. In the event that the consultant is
concurrently employed by the Company and a third party, the Company has taken
additional steps to ensure that any Company Intellectual Property developed by
such a consultant does not belong to the third party or conflict with the third
party's employment agreement such steps include ensuring that all research and
development work performed by such a consultant are performed only on the
Company's facilities and only using the Company's resources, except as set forth
in Section 2.17(s) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

        4.2 No Solicitation. Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1
hereof, the Company will not take, nor will the Company permit any of the
Company's officers, directors, employees, shareholders, attorneys, investment
advisors, agents, representatives, Affiliates or Associates to (directly or
indirectly), take any of the following actions with any Person other than
Broadcom and its designees: (a) solicit, encourage, initiate, review or
participate in or conduct discussions with or engage in negotiations with, any
Person relating to any offer or proposal, oral, written or otherwise, formal or
informal (a "Competing Proposed Transaction"), with respect to any possible
Business Combination with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether such
Subsidiaries are in existence on the date hereof or are hereafter organized),
(b) provide information with respect to the Company to any Person, other than
Broadcom, relating to (or which the Company believes would be used for the
purpose of formulating an offer or proposal with respect to), or otherwise
assist, cooperate with, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any
such Person with regard to, any possible Business Combination with the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company (whether such Subsidiaries are in existence on
the date hereof or are hereafter organized), (c) agree to, enter into a Contract
with any Person, other than Broadcom, providing for, or approve a Business
Combination with the Company or any Subsidiary (whether


                                       41
<PAGE>   48

such Subsidiaries are in existence on the date hereof or are hereafter
organized), (d) make or authorize any statement, recommendation, solicitation or
endorsement in support of any possible Business Combination with the Company or
any Subsidiary (whether such Subsidiary is in existence on the date hereof or
are hereafter organized) other than by Broadcom, or (e) authorize or permit any
of the Company's Representatives to take any such action. The Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any such contacts or negotiations
with any Person relating to any such transaction or Business Combination. It
shall not be a breach of this Section 4.2 if the Company or its Representatives
receive inquiries regarding any Business Combination; provided that the Company
complies with the notice provisions of this Section 4.2 and the Company and its
Representatives comply with the confidentiality obligations of the
Confidentiality Agreement and any of its Representatives respond to such
inquiries by refusing to discuss the matter further with such third party or by
indicating, consistent with their obligations under Section 4.2 hereof and the
Confidentiality Agreement, that neither the Representative nor the Company may
discuss the matter. In addition to the foregoing, if the Company receives prior
to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement any offer or proposal
(formal or informal, oral, written or otherwise) relating to, or any inquiry or
contact from any Person with respect to, a Competing Proposed Transaction, the
Company shall immediately notify Broadcom thereof, such notice to include the
identity of the person proposing such Competing Proposal Transaction and will
keep Broadcom of the status of any such Competing Proposed Transaction;
provided, however, that this provision shall not in any way be deemed to limit
the obligations of the Company and its Representatives set forth in the previous
sentence. Each of the Company and Broadcom acknowledge that this Section 4.2 was
a significant inducement for Broadcom to enter into this Agreement and the
absence of such provision would have resulted in either (i) a material reduction
in the merger consideration to be paid to the shareholders of the Company or
(ii) a failure to induce Broadcom to enter into this Agreement.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

        5.1 Information Statement; Permit Application.

               (a) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall prepare, with the full cooperation of Broadcom, the
Information Statement for the shareholders of the Company to approve this
Agreement, the Agreement of Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Broadcom and the Company shall each use reasonable commercial efforts to cause
the Information Statement to comply with applicable federal and state securities
laws requirements. Each of Broadcom and the Company agrees to provide promptly
to the other such information concerning its business and financial statements
and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its
counsel, may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the Information
Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel
and auditors to cooperate with the other's counsel and auditors in the
preparation of the Information Statement. The Company will promptly advise
Broadcom, and Broadcom will promptly advise the Company, in writing if at any
time prior to the Effective Time either the Company or Broadcom, as applicable,
shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate
to amend or supplement the Information Statement in


                                       42
<PAGE>   49

order to make the statements contained or incorporated by reference therein not
misleading or to comply with applicable law. The Information Statement shall
contain the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company (which was
unanimous) that the Company's shareholders approve the Merger and this Agreement
and the conclusion of the board of directors that the terms and conditions of
the Merger are advisable and fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests
of, the shareholders of the Company. Anything to the contrary contained herein
notwithstanding, the Company shall not include in the Information Statement any
information with respect to Broadcom or its affiliates or associates, the form
and content of which information shall not have been approved by Broadcom prior
to such inclusion.

               (b) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
Broadcom shall prepare, with the full cooperation of the Company, and file, the
Permit Application, provided that Broadcom shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to so prepare and file such Permit Application within ten
(10) Business Days therefrom. Broadcom and the Company shall each use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Permit Application to comply with
the requirements of applicable federal and state laws. Each of Broadcom and the
Company agrees to provide promptly to the other such information concerning its
business and financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of
the providing party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate for inclusion
in the Permit Application, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and to
cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the other's counsel and
auditors in the preparation and completion of the Permit Application. Broadcom,
with the full cooperation of the Company, will use commercially reasonable
efforts to respond to any comments from the California Department of
Corporations and use commercially reasonable efforts to have the California
Permit granted as soon as practicable after such filing, including, scheduling
the Fairness Hearing on the first practicable date after filing of the Permit
Application. The Company will promptly advise Broadcom, and Broadcom will
promptly advise the Company, in writing if at any time prior to the Effective
Time either the Company or Broadcom, as applicable, shall obtain knowledge of
any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the
Permit Application in order to make the statements contained or incorporated by
reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable law. Anything to
the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, Broadcom shall not include in the
Permit Application any information with respect to the Company or its affiliates
or associates, the form and content of which information shall not have been
approved by the Company prior to such inclusion.

               (c) If notwithstanding such exercise of commercially reasonable
efforts, the parties fail to obtain such California Permit within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Fairness Hearing or such shorter or longer period as the
parties agree in writing (and notwithstanding the foregoing, and in event by
October 30, 2000), the parties agree that Broadcom, with full cooperation of the
Company, shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement
on Form S-4 or successor form (the "Registration Statement") related to the
offer and sale of Broadcom Common Stock in connection with the offer and sale of
Broadcom Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

        5.2 Shareholder Approval. As soon as practicable following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall give written notice of this
Agreement and the proposed Merger to all Company shareholders and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to solicit and


                                       43
<PAGE>   50

obtain from shareholders of the Company written consents in favor of the Merger
and this Agreement and take all other action necessary in accordance with the
California Code and its articles of incorporation and bylaws to secure the
written consent of its shareholders required to effect the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement before October 30, 2000. The Company
shall submit this Agreement to its shareholders for adoption whether or not the
Company's board of directors determines at any time subsequent to declaring its
advisability that this Agreement is no longer advisable and recommends that its
shareholders reject it. The Company shall consult with Broadcom regarding the
date of the Company Shareholder Action and shall not postpone or adjourn (other
than for the absence of a quorum) any solicitation of written consents of the
shareholders of the Company without the consent of Broadcom, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. The materials submitted to the shareholders of the
Company in respect of the Merger shall have been subject to prior review and
comment by Broadcom and shall include (a) information regarding the Company, the
terms of the Merger and this Agreement, (b) a statement to the effect that the
board of directors of the Company has unanimously recommended that the Company's
shareholders approve the Merger and this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and approve and execute such other documents as may be
required to satisfy the applicable requirements of the Securities Act in
connection with the issuance and sale of Broadcom Common Stock in connection
with the Merger, (c) a statement to the effect that the board of directors of
the Company has concluded that the terms and conditions of the Merger are
advisable, fair and reasonable to, and in the best interests of, the Company's
shareholders and (d) such other documents as may be required to satisfy the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act in connection with the issuance
and sale of Broadcom Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

        5.3 Access to Information. Between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, upon
reasonable notice the Company shall (a) give Broadcom and its officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financing sources and other agents and
representatives reasonable access to all buildings, offices, and other
facilities and to all Books and Records of the Company, whether located on the
premises of the Company or at another location; (b) permit Broadcom to make such
inspections as they may reasonably require; (c) cause its officers to furnish
Broadcom such financial, operating, technical and product data and other
information with respect to the business and Assets and Properties of the
Company as Broadcom from time to time may reasonably request, including
financial statements and schedules; (d) allow Broadcom the opportunity to
interview such employees and other personnel and Affiliates of the Company with
the Company's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; and (e) assist and cooperate with Broadcom in the
development of integration plans for implementation by Broadcom and the
Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time; provided, however, that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company herein. Materials furnished
to Broadcom pursuant to this Section 5.3 may be used by Broadcom for strategic
and integration planning purposes relating to accomplishing the transactions
contemplated hereby.

        5.4 Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge that Broadcom and the
Company have previously executed an exclusivity and non-disclosure agreement
dated June 29, 2000 and a joint non-disclosure agreement dated March 15, 2000
(together, the "Confidentiality Agreements"), which Confidentiality Agreements
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their


                                       44
<PAGE>   51

respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, all information furnished to
Broadcom and its officers, employees, accountants and counsel by the Company,
and all information furnished to the Company by Broadcom and its officers,
employees, accountants and counsel, shall be covered by the Confidentiality
Agreements, and Broadcom and the Company shall be fully liable and responsible
under the Confidentiality Agreements for any breach of the terms and conditions
thereof by their respective subsidiaries, officers, employees, accountants and
counsel.

        5.5 Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, including all legal,
accounting, tax, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses
of third parties ("Third Party Expenses"), incurred by a party in connection
with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the obligation of
the respective party incurring such fees and expenses. The Company shall not pay
any Third Party Expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the Merger
without the prior written approval of Broadcom, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld.

        5.6 Public Disclosure. Unless otherwise required by Law (including
federal and state securities laws) or, as to Broadcom, by the rules and
regulations of the NASD, prior to the Effective Time, no public disclosure
(whether or not in response to any inquiry) of the existence of any subject
matter of, or the terms and conditions of, this Agreement shall be made by any
party hereto unless approved by Broadcom and the Company prior to release;
provided, however, that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Broadcom and the Company shall be
permitted to disclose the existence of this Agreement to their customers,
suppliers and sales representatives with whom it has non-disclosure agreements
that apply to such disclosure (or the other party otherwise agrees to such
disclosure) and, except as prohibited by Section 4.2, for which there is a
business reason for the disclosure and (ii) pursuant to Section 4.2, the Company
may, in general terms only, in response to inquiries from third parties
concerning any Competing Proposed Transaction, that the Company is under a
contractual obligation not to discuss such matters.

        5.7 Approvals. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all Approvals from Governmental or Regulatory Authorities or under any of
the Contracts or other agreements as may be required in connection with the
Merger (all of such Approvals are set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule)
so as to preserve all rights of and benefits to the Company thereunder and
Broadcom shall provide the Company with such assistance and information as is
reasonably required to obtain such Approvals.

        5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Broadcom, and Broadcom shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or
Broadcom, respectively, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
at or prior to the Closing Date and (b) any failure of the Company or Broadcom,
as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall not limit or
otherwise affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice.


                                       45
<PAGE>   52

        5.9 Company Affiliate Agreements. Schedule 5.9 sets forth those persons
who, in the Company's reasonable judgment following consultation with legal
counsel and accounting advisors, are or may be "affiliates" of the Company
within the meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Company
Affiliates"). The Company shall provide Broadcom such information and documents
as Broadcom shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered to Broadcom on or prior to the Closing from each of the Company
Affiliates, an executed Company Affiliate Agreement.

        5.10 Additional Documents and Further Assurances; Cooperation. Each
party hereto, at the request of the other party hereto, shall execute and
deliver such other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things
(including all action reasonably necessary to seek and obtain any and all
consents, waivers and approvals of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority or
Person required in connection with the Merger; provided, however, that Broadcom
shall not be obligated to consent to any divestitures or operational limitations
or activities in connection therewith and no party shall be obligated to make a
payment of money as a condition to obtaining any such consent, waiver or
approval) as may be necessary or desirable for effecting completely, and
satisfying the conditions set forth in Article 6 to, the consummation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Article 6
to be satisfied, where the satisfaction of such condition depends on action or
forbearance from action by such party.

        5.11 Indemnification. Broadcom, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation agree that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing
in favor of the employees, agents, directors or officers of the Company (the
"Company Indemnified Parties") as provided in its articles of incorporation or
bylaws or indemnification agreements as in effect on the date of this Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect and be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation for a period of not less than four years from the Closing Date. Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether a Company Indemnified
Party's conduct complies with the standards set forth in the articles of
incorporation or bylaws or indemnification agreements of the Company in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, or otherwise shall be made by independent
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation reasonably satisfactory to the
Company Indemnified Party (whose fees and expenses shall be paid by the
Surviving Corporation), which such determination shall be final and binding on
the parties thereto. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Broadcom that
no claim for indemnification has been made by any director or officer of the
Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, no basis exists for any such claim
for indemnification.

        5.12 Form S-8. Broadcom shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
for the shares of Broadcom Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company
Options promptly, but no later than fifteen (15) Business Days, after the
Effective Time to the extent the shares of Broadcom Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Company Options qualify for registration on Form S-8.

        5.13 Company's Auditors. The Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its management and its independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP,
to facilitate on a timely basis (a) the preparation of financial statements
(including pro forma financial statements if


                                       46
<PAGE>   53

required) as required by Broadcom to comply with applicable SEC regulations, (b)
the review of any Company audit or review work papers, including the examination
of selected interim financial statements and data and (c) the delivery of such
representations from the Company's independent accountants as may be reasonably
requested by Broadcom or its accountants.

        5.14 Termination of 401(k) Plans. Unless Broadcom requests in writing at
least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, the board of directors of the
Company shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective as of the day prior to
the Closing Date, any Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and which is sponsored, or contributed to,
by the Company (the "401(k) Plan"). At the Closing the Company shall provide
Broadcom (a) executed resolutions of the board of directors of the Company
authorizing such termination and (b) an executed amendment to the 401(k) Plan
sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the
401(k) Plan will be maintained at the time of termination. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, prior to the termination of the 401(k) Plan,
the Company shall amend the 401(k) Plan (i) to provide that a matching
contribution be made before the Closing Date on behalf of each participant who
remains employed with the Company through the Cut-Off Date with respect to
salary deferrals made by such participant under the 401(k) during that portion
of the current plan year ending with the Cutoff Date, the amount of such
matching contribution to be determined in accordance with the terms of the
401(k) Plan other than the 401(k) Plan's current requirement that a participant
complete one thousand (1,000) hours of service and be employed on the last day
of the plan year (but in no event exceeding one thousand five hundred dollars
($1,500) for any participant) and (ii) to provide that no other matching
contributions will be made under the 401(k) Plan with respect to salary
deferrals made in any plan year ending on or after the Cutoff Date. For purposes
of this Section 5.14, "Cut-Off Date" shall mean a date selected by the Company
that is sufficiently before the Closing Date to permit the matching contribution
referenced in the prior sentence to be computed and contributed to the 401(k)
Plan before the Closing Date.

        5.15 Listing of Additional Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, if
required by applicable Nasdaq rules, Broadcom shall file with the NNM a
Notification Form for Listing of Additional Shares with respect to the shares of
Buyer Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Company Common Stock in the
Merger and upon exercise of the options under the Company Stock Plan assumed by
Broadcom to the effect that such shares may be traded immediately after the
Effective Time.

        5.16 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the board of directors of
the Company will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of any Takeover
Statute on any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        5.17 Additional Affiliate Agreements. If any Person would have been a
Company Affiliate had such Person been a shareholder, officer or director of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement, the Company shall cause such person to
execute and deliver to Broadcom a Company Affiliate Agreement promptly upon such
Person attaining such status.


                                       47
<PAGE>   54

        5.18 Treatment as Reorganization. Neither Broadcom nor the Company shall
take any action prior to or following the Closing that would cause the Merger to
fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code.

        5.19 Company Repurchases. The Company will exercise any rights that
mature between the date hereof and the Effective Time to repurchase any
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock at the price at which such shares
were issued.

        5.20 Information Technology Access. In furtherance of the Company's
agreement in Section 5.3 and to facilitate prompt integration following the
Closing of the Company's information technology ("IT") inventory (e.g., voice
and data network services and software and hardware, licenses,
financial/accounting software, IT budgets, etc.) with Broadcom's, the Company
will provide Broadcom and its Representatives with access to the Company's IT
inventory, as well as the Company's personnel responsible for such IT inventory.
Because of the substantial lead time that may be required to order and install
new software and hardware to integrate the Company's IT systems with Broadcom's,
and the importance of a smooth integration of such IT systems promptly after the
Closing, the Company agrees that Broadcom may order in Broadcom's name, any new
IT services, hardware and software that Broadcom believes will be needed at the
Company's facilities in order to integrate Broadcom's and the Company's
respective operations following the Closing. The Company or Broadcom, under the
Company's direction, will install such IT systems, hardware and software prior
to and in anticipation of the Closing. For clarity, it is the parties' intent
not to connect any of the ordered services or systems prior to the Closing.
Broadcom and the Company agree to cooperate with each other to minimize any
potential disruption to the Company's business from the IT integration efforts;
provided, however, except as provided below, that Broadcom will not have any
liability to the Company for any such disruption or as may otherwise result from
the IT integration efforts, except as may be directly caused by Broadcom's gross
negligence or willful misconduct If the Closing does not occur, other than
because of the Company's breach of the Merger Agreement, Broadcom will reimburse
the Company for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by it
in connection with the ordering and installation of IT services, hardware and
software, restoration of the Company's premises to its original condition prior
to such installation and any indirect, incidental, consequential, special or
speculative damages, including damages for loss of profits or use, business
interruption or loss of goodwill, irrespective of whether such damages arise
under contract, tort, statute or otherwise and whether or not the Company has
given Broadcom advance notice of the possibility of such damages. If the Closing
does not occur, other than because of Broadcom's breach of the Merger Agreement,
the Company will reimburse Broadcom for any reasonable and documented costs
incurred by Broadcom in connection with the retention by the Company of any IT
services, hardware or software installed by Broadcom or its agents after the
date of this Agreement. If Broadcom is so required to reimburse the Company,
Broadcom will own any such hardware and software and will pay for its removal
from Company premises. Broadcom and the Company will cooperate in the removal of
any such hardware or software so as to minimize any disruption to the Company's
business. In addition, if the Closing does not occur, the Company will cooperate
with Broadcom in canceling any orders for IT services, hardware or software and
will otherwise act to minimize the costs which might be incurred in connection
with the IT integration efforts.


                                       48
<PAGE>   55

        5.21 Change of Merger Form. The Company agrees that in the event
Broadcom requests that the transactions contemplated hereby be effected through
a different form of merger (including a reverse triangular or forward triangular
merger) than the form presently contemplated herein, and provided that the
alternative form of merger is in any event intended to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization, the Company shall cooperate with Broadcom in effecting the
alternative form of merger and will take all reasonably necessary action towards
such end, including the execution of any amendments to this Agreement (provided
that such amendments relate only to the alternative form of merger and any
related matters and do not include any other substantive changes not otherwise
agreed between the parties).

        5.22 Intellectual Property.

               (a) The Company shall give Broadcom prompt notice of that any
Person shall have (i) commenced, or shall have notified the Company that it
intends to commence, an Action or Proceeding or (ii) provided the Company with
notice, in either case which allege(s) that any of the Intellectual Property,
including the Company Intellectual Property, presently embodied, or proposed to
be embodied, in the Company's products or utilized in Company-designed or
modified development tools (including standard cells) or design environments
infringes or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights of such Person,
is available for licensing from a potential licensor providing the notice or
otherwise alleges that the Company does not otherwise own or have the right to
exploit such Intellectual Property, including the Company Intellectual Property.
The Company shall cooperate with Broadcom in making arrangements, prior to the
Closing Date, satisfactory to Broadcom in its reasonable discretion to effect
the assignment to the Company of all Intellectual Property created by the
Company's founders, employees and consultants for and on behalf of the Company,
including Intellectual Property created by the Company's founders prior to the
Company's incorporation (except for Intellectual Property created for or on
behalf of any third parties prior to the Company's incorporation pursuant to
employment or consulting arrangements and to the extent such Intellectual
Property is (x) unrelated to the Company's business, (y) owned solely and
exclusively by the Company's founders, and (z) assignable by the founders), and
to obtain the cooperation of such Persons to complete all appropriate patent
filings related thereto. The Company shall take commercially reasonable actions
to maintain, perfect, preserve or renew the Company Registered Intellectual
Property, including the payment of any registration, maintenance, renewal fees,
annuity fees and taxes or the filing of any documents, applications or
certificates related thereto, and to promptly respond and prepare to respond to
all requests, related to the Company Registered Intellectual Property, received

to cause the cash exercise price therefor to be paid to the Company; (b) to
cause the holders of all such outstanding Company Warrants to execute and

following Hellosoft's delivery of each Deliverable (as that term is defined in

of November 11, 1999 (the "Master Business Agreement") provided by Hellosoft
under the 128MSEC SOW and the Remaining SOWs that has not been accepted by the
Company prior to the signing of this


                                       50
<PAGE>   57

Agreement (as those terms are defined in the Amendment to Master Business

in accordance with the terms of the applicable SOW. The Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each Outstanding Deliverable from
Hellosoft, Inc. so that the Company is able to fulfill its testing and
evaluation obligations under this Section 5.26 prior to Closing. With respect to
each Outstanding Deliverable, the Company will not communicate to Hellosoft,
Inc. its acceptance of such Deliverable without obtaining Broadcom's prior
written consent. The Company will permit Broadcom, at times and places to be
mutually agreed upon by the parties, to (i) inspect and approve of the testing
facilities, tools, methods and criteria for each Outstanding Deliverable prior
to the testing of each Outstanding Deliverable and (ii) witness each and every
test of the aforementioned Deliverables. The Company will also promptly provide
Broadcom with all test and evaluation results for each Outstanding Deliverable
and otherwise cooperate with providing Broadcom information and other assistance
reasonably requested by Broadcom concerning the Outstanding Deliverables.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is not obligated to disclose any
information or permit Broadcom to witness any test that would violate the
Company's duty of confidentiality to Hellosoft, Inc. under Section 12 of the
Master Business Agreement.

been communicated to each such employee, and no such employee shall have given

covenants set forth in this Agreement or (ii) any material adverse change
resulting from changes in economic conditions in the economy generally or the
semiconductor industry generally; and provided, further, that insofar as adverse

or more from the scheduled merchantability date of October 31, 2000.

<PAGE>   62

                                    ARTICLE 7

       SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS;
                               ESCROW PROVISIONS

        7.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements.
Notwithstanding any right of Broadcom or the Company (whether or not exercised)
to investigate the affairs of Broadcom or the Company (whether pursuant to
Section 5.3 or otherwise) or a waiver by Broadcom or the Company of any
condition to Closing set forth in Article 6, each party shall have the right to
rely fully upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
other party contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement. Except for (i) the covenant contained in Section 5.11 (which
shall survive for the period set forth therein) and (ii) Article 7 (which shall
survive until termination of the escrow created thereby and the satisfaction of
any other obligations described therein), all of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company and Broadcom contained in
this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Merger and continue until the first anniversary of the Closing Date
(the "Expiration Date").

        7.2 Escrow Provisions.

               (a) Establishment of the Escrow Fund. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without any act of any shareholder,
will be deposited with the Depositary Agent (plus a proportionate share of any
additional shares of Broadcom Common Stock as may be issued upon any stock
splits, stock dividends or recapitalizations effected by Broadcom following the
Effective Time), such deposit to constitute the "Escrow Fund" to be


                                       56
<PAGE>   63

governed by the terms set forth herein. The portion of the Escrow Amount
contributed on behalf of each shareholder of the Company shall be in proportion
to the aggregate number of shares of Broadcom Common Stock which such holder
would otherwise be entitled under Section 1.6. Notwithstanding the references in
this Agreement to the "escrow" and the Escrow Fund, the parties acknowledge and
agree that the Depositary Agent is acting as a depository and not as an escrow
agent pursuant to this Article 7.

               (b) Recourse to the Escrow Fund. The Escrow Fund shall be
available in its entirety to compensate Broadcom and its officers, directors,
employees, agents, Affiliates and Associates (collectively, the "Broadcom
Indemnitees") for any and all Losses (whether or not involving a Third Party
Claim) incurred or sustained by Broadcom or any other Broadcom Indemnitee as a
result of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company set forth in Section 2.17 of this Agreement, the related sections of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, any covenant or agreement of the Company in this
Agreement relating to Intellectual Property (including the agreements of the
Company set forth in Section 5.22 and, insofar as it relates to waivers of
Made-in-America Requirements, other provisions of Article 5) or the related
portions of any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (collectively,
"IP Losses"), and a portion of the Escrow Fund equal to two-thirds of the Escrow
Amount shall be available to compensate the Broadcom Indemnitees for any and all
Losses (including IP Losses), incurred or sustained by Broadcom or any other
Broadcom Indemnitee as a result of any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement or in the Ancillary Agreements or in any instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement; provided, however, that, except in the case of claims for
Losses resulting from a breach, violation or inaccuracy in or omission from any
of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 2.3 of
this Agreement or the related sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
Broadcom may not make any claims against the Escrow Fund unless the aggregate
Losses incurred or sustained exceed seven hundred fifty thousand dollars
($750,000) (at which such time claims may be made for all Losses incurred or
sustained). The dollar threshold set forth in the immediately preceding proviso
shall not apply to Losses resulting from any breach, violation or inaccuracy in
or omission from any of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in Section 2.3 of this Agreement or the related sections of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, which shall be recoverable without respect to any threshold
amount. Broadcom and the Company each acknowledge that all such Losses, if any,
would relate to unresolved contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which
if resolved at the Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the aggregate
Merger consideration to be paid to the shareholders of the Company. The
shareholders of the Company shall not have any liability under this Agreement of
any sort whatsoever in excess of the Escrow Fund, except in the event of fraud
or an intentional breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
but excluding a negligent, grossly negligent or reckless breach, by the Company
of any of its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained in
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or in any other instrument or document
required to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement in connection herewith. In
the event of such a fraudulent breach, Broadcom shall have all remedies
available at law or in equity (including for tort) with respect to such breach;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in no event shall any shareholder of the Company have any
liability in excess of the Merger consideration received by such shareholder in
connection with the Merger or the proceeds, if


                                       57
<PAGE>   64

any, received by such shareholder in connection with the disposition of such
Merger consideration.

               (c) Escrow Period; Distribution of Escrow Fund upon Termination
of Escrow Period. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall
be in existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at
5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the Expiration Date (the period of time from the
Effective Time through and including the Expiration Date is referred to herein
as the "Escrow Period"); and all shares of Broadcom Common Stock remaining in
the Escrow Fund shall be distributed as set forth in the last sentence of this
Section 7.2(c); provided, however, that the Escrow Period shall not terminate
with respect to such amount (or some portion thereof) that is necessary in the
reasonable judgment of Broadcom, subject to the objection of the Shareholder
Agent and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner as provided in
Section 7.2(g) hereof, to satisfy any unsatisfied claims under this Section 7.2
concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination of such
Escrow Period which claims are specified in any Officer's Certificate delivered
to the Depositary Agent prior to termination of such Escrow Period. As soon as
all such claims, if any, have been resolved, the Depositary Agent shall deliver
to the shareholders of the Company the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not
required to satisfy such claims. Deliveries of shares of Broadcom Common Stock
remaining in the Escrow Fund to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to this
Section 7.2(c) shall be made ratably in proportion to their respective
contributions to the Escrow Fund. Each shareholder of the Company who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Broadcom Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Broadcom Common Stock to be received by
such holder) shall be entitled to receive from Broadcom an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (a) such fraction,
multiplied by (b) the Closing Price. Broadcom shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have such shares and cash delivered within five (5)
Business Days after such resolution.

                (d) Protection of Escrow Fund.

                      (i) The Depositary Agent shall hold and safeguard the
Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Broadcom
and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms
hereof.

                      (ii) Any shares of Broadcom Common Stock or other Equity
Equivalents securities issued or distributed by Broadcom ("New Shares") in
respect of Broadcom Common Stock in the Escrow Fund which have not been released
from the Escrow Fund shall be added to the Escrow Fund. New Shares issued in
respect of shares of Broadcom Common Stock which have been released from the
Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to
the record holders thereof. Cash dividends on Broadcom Common Stock shall not be
added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the record holders of
Broadcom Common Stock on the record date set for any such dividend.

                      (iii) Each shareholder shall have voting rights with
respect to the shares of Broadcom Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund by
such shareholder (and on any


                                       58
<PAGE>   65

voting securities added to the Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Broadcom
Common Stock).

               (e) Claims Upon Escrow Fund.

                      (i) Upon receipt by the Depositary Agent at any time on or
before the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any officer
of Broadcom (an "Officer's Certificate"): (A) stating that Broadcom or another
Broadcom Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that
it will have to pay or accrue Losses, directly or indirectly, as a result of any
inaccuracy or breach or any inaccuracy or breach alleged by a third party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement or in any of the Ancillary Agreements or in any instrument or
agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) specifying in reasonable
detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date
each such item was paid or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated
liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty,
agreement or covenant to which such item is related, the Depositary Agent shall,
subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(f), deliver to Broadcom out of the
Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of Broadcom Common Stock held in
the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such Losses. Where the basis for a claim
upon the Escrow Fund by Broadcom is that Broadcom reasonably anticipates that it
will pay or accrue a Loss, no payment will be made from the Escrow Fund for such
Loss unless and until such Loss is actually paid or accrued.

                      (ii) For the purposes of determining the number of shares
of Broadcom Common Stock to be delivered to Broadcom out of the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 7.2(e)(i), the shares of Broadcom Common Stock shall be
valued at the Closing Price.

               (f) Objections to Claims. At the time of delivery of any
Officer's Certificate to the Depositary Agent, a duplicate copy of such
certificate shall be delivered to the Shareholder Agent and for a period of
thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Depositary Agent shall make no
delivery to Broadcom of any Escrow Amounts pursuant to Section 7.2(e) unless the
Depositary Agent shall have received written authorization from the Shareholder
Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period, the Depositary Agent shall make delivery of shares of Broadcom Common
Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 7.2(e), provided that no
such payment or delivery may be made if the Shareholder Agent shall object in a
written statement to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate, and such
statement shall have been delivered to the Depositary Agent prior to the
expiration of such thirty (30) day period.

               (g) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

                      (i) In case the Shareholder Agent shall object in writing
to any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate, the Shareholder Agent
and Broadcom shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholder Agent
and Broadcom should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Depositary
Agent. The Depositary Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and


                                       59
<PAGE>   66

distribute shares of Broadcom Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms thereof.

                      (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, either Broadcom or the Shareholder Agent may demand arbitration of
the dispute unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue in a pending
Action or Proceeding involving a Third Party Claim, in which event arbitration
shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration; and in either event the matter shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by three arbitrators, one selected by Broadcom and one selected by the
Shareholder Agent, and the two arbitrators selected by Broadcom and the
Shareholder Agent shall select a third arbitrator. The arbitrators shall set a
limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery of information relating to any dispute while allowing the
parties an opportunity, adequate as determined in the sole judgment of the
arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about
the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to
compel, limit or allow discovery as they shall deem appropriate given the nature
and extent of the disputed claim. The arbitrators shall also have the authority
to impose sanctions, including attorneys' fees and other costs incurred by the
parties, to the same extent as a court of law or equity, should the arbitrators
determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to by a party without substantial
justification. The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the
validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's Certificate shall be binding
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything
in Section 7.2(f), the Depositary Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance
with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in
accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by
written findings of fact and conclusions regarding the dispute which shall set
forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators.

                      (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators
may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any such arbitration
shall be held in the city and county of Los Angeles, California under the
commercial rules of arbitration then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association. For purposes of this Section 7.2(g), in any arbitration hereunder
in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Officer's Certificate is
at issue, Broadcom shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party in the event
that the arbitrators award Broadcom less than the sum of one-half of the
disputed amount of any Losses plus any amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the
shareholders of the Company as represented by the Shareholder Agent shall be
deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. The Non-Prevailing Party to an
arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the
administrative costs of the arbitration and the expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by the other party to the arbitration.

               (h) Shareholder Agent of the Shareholders; Power of Attorney.

                      (i) In the event that the Merger is approved by the
shareholders of the Company, effective upon such vote, and without further act
of any shareholder, James Wei shall be appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact
(the "Shareholder Agent") for each shareholder of the Company (except such
shareholders, if any, as shall have perfected their appraisal or dissenters'
rights under the California Code), for and on behalf of shareholders of the
Company, to give and


                                       60
<PAGE>   67

receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Broadcom of shares
of Broadcom Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by
Broadcom, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of
courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Agent for
the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the
shareholders of the Company from time to time upon not less than thirty (30)
days prior written notice to Broadcom; provided, however, that the Shareholder
Agent may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest in the Escrow
Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted shareholder
agent. Any vacancy in the position of Shareholder Agent may be filled by
approval of the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond
shall be required of the Shareholder Agent, and the Shareholder Agent shall not
receive compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the
Shareholder Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the shareholders of
the Company.

                      (ii) The Shareholder Agent shall not incur any liability
with respect to any action taken or suffered by him or omitted hereunder as
Shareholder Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable
judgment. The Shareholder Agent may, in all questions arising hereunder, rely on
the advice of counsel and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith
by the Shareholder Agent based on such advice, the Shareholder Agent shall not
be liable to anyone. The Shareholder Agent undertakes to perform such duties and
only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
Shareholder Agent.

                      (iii) The Shareholder Agent shall have reasonable access
to information about the Company and the reasonable assistance of the Company's
officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its
rights hereunder, provided that the Shareholder Agent shall treat confidentially
and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Company to anyone
(except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree in writing to treat
such information confidentially).

               (i) Actions of the Shareholder Agent. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all the
shareholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to them
are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon
each of such shareholders, and the Depositary Agent and Broadcom may rely upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Agent as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of every such shareholder of the
Company. The Depositary Agent and Broadcom are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Agent.

               (j) Third-Party Claims. In the event Broadcom becomes aware of a
third-party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Broadcom reasonably expects may
result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Broadcom shall notify the
Shareholder Agent of such claim, and the Shareholder Agent, as representative
for the shareholders of the Company, shall be entitled, at their expense, to
participate in any defense of such claim. Broadcom shall have the right in its
sole discretion to settle any Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if
Broadcom settles any


                                       61
<PAGE>   68

Third Party Claim without the Shareholder Agent's consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Broadcom may not make a claim against
the Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred by Broadcom in
such settlement. In the event that the Shareholder Agent has consented to any
such settlement, the Shareholder Agent shall have no power or authority to
object under any provision of this Article 7 to the amount of any claim by
Broadcom against the Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred
by Broadcom in such settlement.

               (k) Indemnification for Shareholder Agent. The shareholders of
the Company shall, severally and not jointly, on a pro rata basis based on their
proportionate ownership interests in the Company, indemnify, defend and hold the
Shareholder Agent harmless from and against any loss, damage, tax, liability and
expense that may be incurred by the Shareholder Agent arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Shareholder Agent's
duties, except as caused by the Shareholder Agent's gross negligence or willful
misconduct, including the legal costs and expenses of defending such Shareholder
Agent against any claim or liability in connection with the performance of the
Shareholder Agent's duties. The Shareholder Agent shall be entitled, but not
limited, to such indemnification from the Escrow prior to any distribution
thereof to the shareholders of the Company, but after any distributions
therefrom to Broadcom.

               (l) Depositary Agent's Duties.

                      (i) Limitation on Duties of Depositary Agent. The
Depositary Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties as
are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any additional written
escrow instructions which the Depositary Agent may receive after the date of
this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Broadcom and the Shareholder
Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting
on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties. The Depositary Agent shall not be
liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Depositary Agent while acting in
good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith.

                      (ii) Compliance with Orders. The Depositary Agent is
hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey Orders of any court of law
or Governmental or Regulatory Authority, notwithstanding any notices, warnings
or other communications from any party or any other person to the contrary. In
case the Depositary Agent obeys or complies with any such Order, the Depositary
Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by
reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such Order being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been entered
without jurisdiction or proper authority.

                      (iii) Limitations on Liability of Depositary Agent. The
Depositary Agent shall not be liable in any respect on account of (A) the
identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or
purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents or papers
deposited or called for hereunder; or (B) the expiration of any rights under


                                       62
<PAGE>   69

any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any documents
deposited with the Depositary Agent.

                      (iv) Good Faith of Depositary Agent. In performing any
duties under the Agreement, the Depositary Agent shall not be liable to any
party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Depositary Agent. The Depositary Agent shall not
incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in
good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument,
including any written statement or affidavit provided for in this Agreement that
the Depositary Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the
Depositary Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations
or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the
Depositary Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with the
Depositary Agent's duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in
any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him, her or it in good faith in
accordance with the advice of counsel. The Depositary Agent is not responsible
for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting
to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.

                      (v) Non-responsibility of Depositary Agent. If any
controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other
party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or conditions,
the Depositary Agent will not be required to determine the controversy or to
take any action regarding it. The Depositary Agent may hold all documents and
shares of Broadcom Common Stock and may wait for settlement of any such
controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the
Depositary Agent's discretion, the Depositary Agent may be required, despite
what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Depositary
Agent will not be liable for any damages. Furthermore, the Depositary Agent may
at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer
and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Depositary Agent is
authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of
Broadcom Common Stock held in escrow, except all costs, expenses, charges and
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Depositary Agent due to the
interpleader action and which the parties jointly and severally agree to pay.
Upon initiating such action, the Depositary Agent shall be fully released and
discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of
this Agreement.

                      (vi) Indemnification of Depositary Agent. Broadcom and its
successors and assigns agrees to indemnify and hold the Depositary Agent
harmless against any and all Losses incurred by the Depositary Agent in
connection with the performance of the Depositary Agent's duties under this
Agreement, including any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its
subject matter.

                      (vii) Resignation of Depositary Agent. The Depositary
Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days written
notice to the parties; provided, however, that no such resignation shall become
effective until the appointment of a successor depositary agent which shall be
accomplished as follows: the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
mutually agree on a successor depositary agent within thirty (30) days after
receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor depositary
agent within such time, the Depositary Agent shall have the right to appoint a
successor depositary agent authorized to do business in the State of California.
The successor depositary agent shall execute


                                       63
<PAGE>   70

and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment and it shall, without
further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and
duties of the predecessor depositary agent as if originally named as Depositary
Agent. The Depositary Agent shall be discharged from any further duties and
liability under this Agreement.

               (m) Fees. All fees of the Depositary Agent for performance of its
duties hereunder shall be paid by Broadcom. In the event that the conditions of
this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Depositary Agent renders
any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a
substantial modification of its terms, or if any controversy arises, or if the
Depositary Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any Action or Proceeding
pertaining to this escrow or its subject matter, the Depositary Agent shall be
reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all
costs, attorney's fees, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay,
controversy or Action or Proceeding. Broadcom agrees to pay these sums upon
demand.

time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or
on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any party of

deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition

        9.5 Third Party Beneficiaries. The terms and provisions of this

have been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit
the provisions hereof.

        9.8 Invalid Provisions. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully
severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and
will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by
its severance herefrom and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

        9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic laws of the State of California, without giving
effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California.

        9.10 Dispute Resolution. In the event of any pre-Closing dispute under
this Agreement which the parties are unable to resolve themselves, the matters,
regardless of nature, shall be submitted to binding arbitration and administered
by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the then most
applicable rules of the AAA (except those rules requiring administration by the
AAA) conducted in the county of Santa Clara, California (if arbitration is first
requested by the Company) or Los Angeles, California (if arbitration is first
requested by Broadcom), by three arbitrators, one selected by Broadcom and one
selected by the Shareholder Agent, and the two arbitrators selected by Broadcom
and the Shareholder Agent shall mutually select a third arbitrator who shall be
a retired judge of the California Superior Court or California Court of Appeals
within ten (10) days of being selected by Broadcom and Shareholder Agent. If
such parties cannot agree, the arbitrator shall be selected, upon application of
either party, by the contract arbitration administrator of JAMS (Judicial
Arbitration and Mediation Services) at the JAMS office closest to the venue of
the arbitration. Each of the arbitrators selected by Broadcom and the Company
must be a corporate lawyer who is a partner at a nationally-recognized law firm
which has not provided and does not provide services to Broadcom, the
Shareholder Agent or the Company.

        9.11 Construction. The parties hereto agree that this Agreement is the
product of negotiation between sophisticated parties and individuals, all of
whom were represented by counsel, and each of whom had an opportunity to
participate in and did participate in, the drafting of each provision hereof.
Accordingly, ambiguities in this Agreement, if any, shall not be construed
strictly or in favor of or against any party hereto but rather shall be given a
fair and reasonable construction without regard to the rule of contra
proferentem.

execute this Agreement following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, and
such later execution, if so executed after the date hereof, shall not affect the
binding nature of this Agreement as of the date hereof between the other
signatories hereto.

        9.13 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Except where this Agreement specifically provides for arbitration, it
is agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to

provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.
