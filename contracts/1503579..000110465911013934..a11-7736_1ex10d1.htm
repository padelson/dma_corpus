(i) the ninetieth day following the date hereof and (ii) the date on which the
Bankruptcy Court initiates a hearing on confirmation of the chapter 11 plan of
reorganization of the Company (such period, the " _Designation Right Period_
"), to, upon written notice to the Company, amend the applicable schedules and
designate (x) any Contract listed as an Excluded Agreement on _Schedule
1.1(d)_ as an Assumed Agreement (to be listed on _Schedule 1.1(c)_), and (y)
any Contract listed as an Assumed Agreement on _Schedule 1.1(c)_ as an
Excluded Agreement (to be listed on _Schedule 1.1(d)_).

 



 

2.6 _Procedures for Assumption of Agreements_.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, the Company shall assume, to the extent not previously
assumed by Order of the Bankruptcy Court, and assign to Purchaser the Assumed
Agreements pursuant to the Sale Order, it being understood that any Assumed
Agreement that is an executory contract or an unexpired lease shall also be
assigned to Purchaser pursuant to Section 365 of the Code. In connection with
such assumption and assignment, and subject to any order of the Bankruptcy
Court as may be necessary or appropriate, the Company shall cure all monetary
defaults under such Assumed Agreements (such amounts, " _Cure Costs_ ") and
Purchaser shall provide adequate assurance of the future performance of such
Assumed Agreements, it being understood that monetary defaults under any such
Assumed Agreement that is an executory contract or an unexpired lease shall be
cured to the extent required by Section 365(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and
adequate assurance of the future performance of any such contract or lease
shall be provided, as required by the Bankruptcy Code.

 



 

(b) Except as may otherwise be determined by an order of the Bankruptcy Court,
nothing herein shall be deemed to require the conveyance, assignment or
transfer of any Purchased Asset that by its terms or by operation of Law
cannot be conveyed, assigned, transferred or assumed without approval or
consent. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent that the sale, assignment, license, sublicense, transfer, conveyance or
delivery or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to
Purchaser of any asset that would be a Purchased Asset or any claim or right
or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any
applicable Law or would require any governmental or third party
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers and such authorizations,
approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the
Closing (any such prohibition, or failure to obtain any such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver, a " _Transfer Failure_ "), the Closing shall
proceed without the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such
asset unless such failure causes a failure of any of the conditions to Closing
set forth in _Article X_, in which event the Closing shall proceed only if
the failed condition is waived by the party entitled to the benefit thereof.
In the event that the failed condition is waived and the Closing proceeds
without the transfer or assignment of any such asset, then following the
Closing, Purchaser and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts,

 



      
 

 



 

and cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such authorizations,
approvals, consents and waivers. Pending such authorization, approval, consent
or waiver, the Parties shall cooperate with each other in any mutually
agreeable arrangement designed to provide Purchaser with all of the benefits
of use of such asset and to the Company the benefits, including any
indemnities, that they would have obtained had the asset been conveyed to
Purchaser at the Closing. Once authorization, approval, consent or waiver for
the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such asset not
sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered at Closing is obtained, the
Company shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver such asset to Purchaser at
no additional cost. To the extent that any such asset cannot be transferred or
the full benefits or use of any such asset cannot be provided to Purchaser
following the Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.6(b)_, then Purchaser and
the Company shall enter into such arrangements (including subleasing,
sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to the Parties the economic (taking
into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent, to the extent
permitted, of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver and
the performance by Purchaser of the obligations thereunder. The Company shall
hold in trust for and pay to Purchaser promptly upon receipt thereof, all
income, proceeds and other monies received by the Company derived from its use
of any Purchased Asset in connection with the arrangements under this _Section
2.6(b)_.

 



 

(c) At Closing, Purchaser shall assume liability for any and all Cure Costs
not previously paid by the Company. The Bankruptcy Court shall retain
jurisdiction to determine any disputes regarding Cure Costs. Notwithstanding
the pendency of a dispute regarding any Cure Cost, the Closing may occur.

 



 

2.7 _Further Conveyances and Assumptions_.

 



 

(a) From time to time following the Closing, to the extent not transferred to
Purchaser and to the extent permitted under applicable Law, the Company shall
and shall cause its Affiliates to, make available to Purchaser such data in
personnel records of Transferred Employees as is reasonably necessary for
Purchaser to effect the transition of such Employees into Purchasers records.

 



 

(b) From time to time following the Closing, the Company and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and
deliver all such further conveyances, assignments, consents, notices,
assumptions, releases and acquittances and such other instruments, and shall
take such further actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
assure fully to Purchaser and its respective successors or assigns, the
transfer of all of the properties, rights, titles, interests, estates,
remedies, powers and privileges intended to be conveyed to Purchaser under
this Agreement and the Company Documents and to assure fully to the Company
and its Affiliates and successors and assigns, the assumption of the
liabilities and obligations intended to be assumed by Purchaser under this
Agreement and the Company Documents, and to otherwise make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

2.8 _Bulk Sales Law_. Purchaser hereby waives, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Documents,
compliance by the Company with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk-
transfer" provision of Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code as it is in
effect in the states where the Company owns assets to be conveyed to Purchaser
hereunder and other similar bulk transfer notice provisions or Laws of

 



      
 

 



 

any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale and
transfer of any or all of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser other than bulk-
transfer tax notice provisions. Pursuant to Section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy
Code, the transfer of the Purchased Assets shall be free and clear of any
security interests in the Purchased Assets, including any liens or claims
arising out of the bulk transfer laws, and the parties shall take such steps
as may be necessary or appropriate to so provide in the Sale Order.

shall be (a) an amount in cash equal to $500,000,000, plus, if applicable

provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Unless this Agreement
has terminated and Section 4.7(c) does not require payment of the Deposit
Commitment Funds to the Company, effective as of the earlier of the Transfer
Approval and the SCI Plan Effective Date (the earliest of such times, the "
_Applicable Time_ "), each Mortgage Lender shall consent to the transfer to
the Escrow Agent of such Mortgage Lenders Ratable Share of the Deposit
Commitment Funds and releases its liens with respect to the Deposit Commitment
Funds to accommodate the transfer of such funds to the Escrow Agent. The CP
Escrowed Funds shall be held by the Escrow Agent in an account designed by the
Escrow Agent. The CP Escrowed Funds will be released by the Escrow Agent and
delivered to either the Mortgage Lenders or to or at the direction of the
Company in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

 



 

3.3 _Payment of Purchase Price; Assumption of Assumed Liabilities_. On the

(b) In connection with Purchasers review of the Company and the Purchased
Assets, Purchaser has received or may receive from the Company certain

Accordingly, Purchaser acknowledges that the Company makes no representation
or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,

reasonably consult with the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information (including Gaming Laws), all the
information relating to the other Person and any of its Affiliates that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
Person or Gaming Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Company and
Purchaser (the " _Notifying Party_ ") shall notify the other Party promptly of
the receipt of comments or requests from any Gaming Authority relating to the
Gaming Approvals and shall supply the other Party with copies of all
correspondence between the Notifying Party or any of its representatives and
the Gaming Authority with respect to the Gaming Approvals; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Company nor Purchaser shall be required to supply
the other Party with copies of communications relating to the personal
applications of individual applicants (except for evidence of filing) or with
any documents that are the subject of a confidentiality agreement barring the
same; _provided further_ that each of the Company and Purchaser shall promptly
notify the other Party upon receiving any communication from the Gaming
Authority that causes such Party to reasonably believe that there is a

delayed.

commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain all other Permits of all
Governmental Entities and all other Persons required to be obtained by

_Antitrust Division_ "), in respect of such filings or such transactions,
(iii) seek early termination of filings under the HSR Act, and (iv) cooperate
with each other in connection with any such filing and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust

each be responsible for paying one-half of the filing fees required to be paid
by under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws in connection with such filings.
Each such Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each
other all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each such Party shall promptly inform the
other Parties of any material oral communication with any Governmental Entity
regarding any such filings or any such transactions. No Party hereto shall
independently participate in any formal meeting with any Governmental Entity
in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving
the other Party prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate.
Subject to applicable Law, the Parties will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any Party relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws. The Company and Purchaser may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 8.4_ as "outside counsel only." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient, unless
express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (the Company or Purchaser, as the case may be).

 



 

(d) Each of Purchaser and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United
States federal or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees,

 



      
 

 



 

administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ").
In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened
in writing to be instituted) challenging that any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement is in violation of any Antitrust Law, each of Purchaser and the
Company shall cooperate and use its commercially reasonable efforts to contest
and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by pursuing all reasonably available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal and all reasonably available legislative action, unless either
Purchaser or the Company reasonably decides that litigation is not in its best
interests. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, in no event
will Purchaser or any of its Affiliates be required hereunder or otherwise (i)
to agree to any hold-separate, divestiture or other order, decree or
restriction on the Casino Business or any other business of Purchaser or its
Affiliates, the conduct thereof or future transactions or (ii) to pay any
amount or agree to any action to obtain any consent or approval required or
contemplated hereby.

commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take all actions necessary or
appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(b) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and, in connection with the foregoing, respond
to inquiries from the other Party regarding the status of such actions or
conditions.

 



 

8.6 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser acknowledges that the Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) provided to it and
its Agents (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) in connection with
this Agreement (including under _Section 8.1_) and the contemplation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, is subject to the terms
of the confidentiality agreement previously dated as of June 25, 2010, entered
into between Fertitta Gaming LLC and the Company (the " _Confidentiality

closing of the Bankruptcy Case and (b) seven (7) years after the Closing Date
(or such longer period as may be required by any Governmental Entity or
ongoing claim), to the extent allowed by applicable Law, Purchaser shall allow
the Company (including, for clarity, any trustee for the estate of the
Company, any trust plan administrator or other entity established under a
chapter 11 plan of the Company or any other successor of the Company) and any
of its directors, officers, employees, counsel, representatives, accountants
and auditors, at the Companys sole cost and expense, reasonable access during
normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to all employees
and files of Purchaser and any books and records and other materials included

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the preparation
of Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns or claims for refund (and any materials
necessary for the preparation of any of the foregoing), financial statements
for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, the management and
handling of any audit, investigation, litigation or other proceeding), and
complying with the rules and regulations of the IRS, the Commission or any
other Governmental Entity, _provided_ that commencing one (1) year following
the Closing Date, Purchaser may dispose of books and records and other
materials that are the subject of this _Section 8.7_ after it gives the

its Affiliates with the Bankruptcy Court or the Commission, neither the

rights under this Agreement.

 **ARTICLE IX**

 

 ** _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

9.1 _Employees_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate all the
Employees, and Purchaser shall offer to all or substantially all of such
Employees at will full-time employment (or at will part-time employment if an
Employee was employed on a part-time basis as of the Closing Date) on the
terms set forth in _Section 9.1(b)_ to be effective immediately, without
interruption, as of the Closing. Such Employees who accept Purchasers offer
of employment shall be referred to as the " _Transferred Employees_." To
facilitate Purchasers obligations under this _Section 9.1(a)_, upon request
and to the extent permitted by Law, the Company shall provide Purchaser within
a reasonable period prior to the Closing a true and correct list of all
Employees, including with respect to any inactive Employee, the reason for
such inactive status and, if applicable, the anticipated date of return to
active employment.

 



 

(b) To the extent permitted by Law, Purchaser shall offer the at will
employment contemplated in _Section 9.1(a)_ to each Transferred Employee on
terms such that the base wages or base salary and other compensation
(including bonus and incentive opportunity) offered to each such Transferred
Employee are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to the base wage, or
base salary and other compensation provided to such Transferred Employee as of
the Closing Date and employee benefits that are, in the aggregate,
substantially comparable to the employee benefits provided to each such
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. The parties hereto
agree that nothing in this Agreement shall limit Purchasers ability after the
Closing Date to modify or terminate, as applicable (i) the employment of any
Transferred Employee, (ii) any benefit policy, plan or program offered to or
covering any Transferred Employee or (iii) the compensation of any Transferred
Employee.

 



 

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained, sponsored or administered by Purchaser on or after the Closing
Date under which the Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate, for
all purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting, and, with
respect only to any severance, vacation or sick time plan, program or
arrangement for purposes of benefit accrual, a Transferred Employees service
with the Company or an Affiliate of the Company shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, be treated as service with Purchaser to the same
extent such service was recognized under a similar Company Benefit Plan;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

 



 

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Company or its Affiliates shall take
all actions reasonably necessary to terminate the participation of each
Transferred Employee in any Company Benefit Plan. Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or

 



      
 

 



 

cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitation under any "employee
welfare benefit plans" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA (including
medical, life insurance and other such employee welfare benefit plans))
maintained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in which Transferred
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Closing, except to the extent such pre-existing condition
limitation or exclusion would have been applicable under any comparable
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize the dollar amount of all expenses
incurred by each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents)
during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of
satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations or exclusions
under any relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing.

 



 

(e) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any employment loss within the
meaning of the WARN Act suffered by any Employee immediately upon or within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date shall have been caused by Purchasers
decision not to continue the employment of such Employee, and not by the sale
of the Purchased Assets. Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates against any and all
claims asserted under the WARN Act because of a "plant closing" or "mass
layoff," as defined therein, due in whole or in part to the actions or
omissions of Purchaser. For purposes of this Agreement, the Closing Date is
and shall be the same as the "effective date" of the sale within the meaning
of the WARN Act. The Company shall give all notices that may be required under
and otherwise required to comply with all provisions of the WARN Act for all
terminations of the Employees that occur prior to Closing based on any
termination decisions made by the Company (other than the terminations
required by _Section 9.1(a))_. Purchaser shall give all notices required
under and otherwise required to comply with all provisions of the WARN Act for
all involuntary terminations of the Employees that occur on or after Closing.
The Company agrees to cooperate with Purchaser so that Purchaser may comply
with the WARN Act, including providing Purchaser with information regarding
the Employees status as full-time or part- time as defined by the WARN Act,
providing Purchaser with information regarding involuntary Employee
terminations during the ninety (90) days prior to Closing, and giving
Purchaser access to the Employees to disseminate any notices pursuant to the
WARN Act in the event Purchaser determines in its sole discretion that such
notice must be given to the Employees prior to Closing due to terminations it
intends to execute during the ninety (90) days immediately following Closing.
If Purchaser determines in its sole discretion that notice must be given to
the Employees prior to Closing pursuant to the WARN Act, the providing of such
notice shall not be deemed to violate any of the confidentiality or publicity
provisions contained in this Agreement.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 9.1_ are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Employees), other than the Parties and their respective
permitted heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, any legal
or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided
for in this _Section 9.1_) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(g) Purchaser or its Affiliates, shall be responsible for and shall reimburse
the Company for all claims that are unpaid as of the Closing Date under any
Company Benefit Plan that is a self-insured "employee welfare benefit plan,"
within the meaning of Section 3(1) of

 



      
 

 



 

ERISA associated with any Transferred Employee (including any dependents
thereof). For purposes of this paragraph, a claim is deemed incurred when the
services that are subject to such claim are performed or the materials are
supplied, regardless of when such claim is submitted for reimbursement.
Purchaser and the "buying group" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9, QandA-2(c)) of which it is a part shall be solely responsible for
providing COBRA continuation coverage pursuant to (i) Section 4980B(f) of the
Code, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and similar state Law to all
Employees and those individuals who are MandA qualified beneficiaries (as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4(b)) with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _M andA
Qualified Beneficiaries_"), and (ii) Title III of Division B of the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, as amended, and all guidance
promulgated thereunder, to the extent applicable with respect to the MandA
Qualified Beneficiaries.

 



 

(h) Subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Purchaser shall take commercially reasonable efforts to permit or
cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to permit each Transferred Employee to enroll
as soon as administratively practicable after the Closing Date and become a
participant in any Purchaser or its Affiliate-sponsored 401(k) plan or other
similar retirement plan for which such employee is eligible (a " _Purchaser
401(k) Plan_") (disregarding any service requirements or waiting periods to
the extent service requirements or waiting periods were satisfied by the
Transferred Employee with respect to a similar Company Benefit Plan prior to
Closing). Purchaser shall permit or cause an Affiliate of Purchaser to permit
the Transferred Employees who are participants in the Companys or its
Affiliates 401(k) plan to roll over any distributions from such plan
(including a rollover of outstanding participant loans) into a Purchaser
401(k) Plan.

 



 

(i) Pursuant to the "Standard Procedure for Predecessors and Successors"
provided in Section 4 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320, (i)
Purchaser and the Company shall report on a predecessor/successor basis as set
forth therein, (ii) the Company will file (or cause to be filed) a Form W-2
for each Transferred Employee with respect to wages paid prior to the Closing
Date, and (iii) Purchaser will file (or cause to be filed) a Form W-2 for each
Transferred Employee with respect wages paid after the Closing Date.

 



 

9.2 _Reservations; Chips; Customer Information_.

 



 

(a) _Reservations_. Following Closing, Purchaser shall honor the terms and
rates of all pre-Closing reservations (in accordance with their terms) with
respect to the Casino Business by customers, including advance reservation
cash deposits, for services confirmed by the Company for any time subsequent
to the Closing, provided, however, that the terms of such reservations shall
be consistent with the Ordinary Course of Business of the Casino Business.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company may continue to accept reservations for
periods after the Closing in the Ordinary Course of Business in operating the
Casino Business. Purchaser recognizes that such reservations may include
discounts or other benefits, including benefits extended under the Companys
or its Affiliates player loyalty program or any other frequent player or
casino awards programs, group discounts, or other discounts or requirements
that food, beverage or other benefits be delivered by the Company to the guest
or guests, as the case may be, holding such reservations. Purchaser shall
honor all banquet facility and service agreements that have been granted to
groups, persons or other customers for periods after the Closing Date at

 



       
 

 



 

the rates and on the terms provided in such agreements, provided, however,
that the terms of such agreements shall be consistent with the Ordinary Course
of Business of the Casino Business. Purchaser agrees that the Company cannot
and does not make any representation or warranty that any party holding a
reservation or agreement for facilities or services shall utilize such
reservation or honor such agreement. Purchaser, by the execution hereof,
solely assumes the risk of non-utilization of reservations and non-performance
of such agreements from and after the Closing.

 



 

(b) _Destruction of Chips_. From and after (i) the date that is one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cease to issue or
use and shall not reissue or reuse any of the Companys gaming chips, tokens
or plaquemines and (ii) the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be solely
responsible and liable for compliance with all applicable Gaming Laws or any
applicable Order with respect to any of the Companys gaming chips, tokens or
plaquemines. During the one hundred eighty (180) period described in _clause
(i)_ of the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser shall (a) redeem all of
the Companys gaming chips, tokens and plaquemines pursuant to a plan of
redemption of discontinued chips, tokens or plaquemines approved by the Gaming
Authorities, and (b) destroy all of the Companys gaming chips, tokens and
plaquemines pursuant to a plan of destruction approved by the Gaming
Authorities.

 



 

(c) _Customer Data._ Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) customers
whose information is contained in the Customer Database may, from time to
time, also be customers of, or otherwise play at, casino properties other than
the Casino Business (including, without limitation, casino properties
presently owned or operated by SCI or its Affiliates) (such customers, the "
_Common Customers_ "), (ii) the Customer Database contains only records of the
Common Customers play at the Casino Business and (iii) except with respect to
the obligations of the Company hereunder in connection with the Customer
Database, neither SCI nor any Affiliate thereof is required pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to furnish to Purchaser any
information which SCI and its Affiliates may have with respect to the activity
of the Common Customers at any casino property presently owned or operated by
SCI or any of its Affiliates. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or
implied, shall prohibit or in any way limit any third party (including,
without limitation, SCI, any of its Affiliates or any acquirers of any of the
casino properties presently owned by any of the foregoing) which holds
information concerning any Common Customer in a database of its own from
marketing to such Common Customer for any purpose, including, without
limitation, in order to induce any such Common Customer to patronize such
third partys casino properties.

 



 

9.3 _Certain Transactions_. Prior to the Closing, neither Purchaser nor its
Affiliates shall take, or agree to commit to take, any action that (or fail to
take, or agree to fail to take, any action, which failure to take) would or is
reasonably likely to delay the receipt of, or to adversely impact the ability
of Purchaser to obtain, any Governmental Approval necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or necessary
to permit Purchaser to acquire the Purchased Assets and operate the Casino
Business, in each case, after the Closing in substantially the same manner as
owned and operated by the Company prior to the Closing. Without limiting the
foregoing:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall withdraw, rescind,
revoke or otherwise terminate or cancel any applications, filings or other
submissions made in connection with obtaining any Governmental Approvals (or
cause any of the foregoing to occur); and

 



 

(b) if (i) any Governmental Entity has issued an Order or taken any other
action denying Purchaser any necessary Governmental Approvals or determining
or indicating that such Governmental Entity will not issue to Purchaser all
necessary Governmental Approvals, or (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or taken any other action
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Closing and the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser,
and its Affiliates shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such order, decree, ruling
or action and to have issued such Governmental Approvals (including exhausting
all available remedies, challenges and appeals).

 



 

9.4 _Insurance Policies_. The Companys fire and casualty insurance and other
insurance policies shall be cancelled by the Company or its applicable
Affiliate as of the Closing Date, and any refunded premiums shall be retained
by the Company. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for acquiring and
placing its casualty insurance, business interruption insurance, liability
insurance and other insurance policies for periods after the Closing.

 



 

9.5 _No Control_. Except as permitted by the terms of this Agreement, prior to
the Closing, Purchaser shall not directly or indirectly control, supervise,
direct or interfere with, or attempt to control, supervise, direct or
interfere with, the Casino Business or the Employees. Until the Closing, the

under the Companys complete control, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, including as provided in _Section 8.2_.

 



 

9.6 _Employee Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates
shall, without Purchasers written consent, solicit, entice, or encourage any
Transferred Employee or any other employee employed by Purchaser to leave such
persons employment with Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to (i) a general solicitation of the public for
employment so long as such general solicitation is not specifically targeted
to employees, officers or directors of Purchaser or (ii) to individuals who
initiate contact with the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates regarding
such employment without any encouragement or solicitation by the Company or
any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(b) Beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the date that is one
year following the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the
Closing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or
indirectly, without the written consent of the Company, as applicable,
solicit, entice, or encourage any Employee that is not a Transferred Employee
or any other person who shall have been an employee of the Company (or any
other individual devoting the majority of his or her working time to service
at or with the Company who is not an employee thereof) or its Affiliates
(other than with respect to the Transferred

 



      
 

 



 

Employees) during such time to leave such persons employment with his or her
employer, including, without limitation, the Company or its Affiliates (other
than with respect to the Transferred Employees); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not apply to (i) a general solicitation of the public for
employment so long as such general solicitation is not specifically targeted
to employees, officers or directors of the Company or any of its Affiliates,
as the case may be, or (ii) to individuals who initiate contact with Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates regarding such employment without any encouragement

the Company and Purchaser under this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the Companys obligation to sell, and Purchasers obligation to buy, the
Purchased Assets, shall, subject to clause (b) below, be enforceable by a
decree of specific performance issued by any court of competent jurisdiction,
and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection
therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be

 



      
 

 



 

cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies
which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that specific performance is not available to
Purchaser as a remedy, for any reason, Purchaser shall be entitled to any and
all other remedies available to it, including damages at law, provided that in
no event shall damages be less than 5% of the Purchase Price. The rights set
forth in this _Section 12.2_ shall be in addition to any other rights which
Purchaser may have at law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Companys
sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement shall be to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 4.5_ and, if applicable, to receive
payment of the FE Escrowed Funds and the Deposit Commitment Funds in
accordance with _Section 4.7(c)_; without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall have no right, whether under clause (a) above or otherwise, to a decree
of specific performance or any other remedy at law or in equity.

 



 

12.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_.

 



 

(a) Upon the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, the Bankruptcy Court shall
have jurisdiction over all matters, including any legal action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any related
agreements, or the proposed transactions and the interpretation,
implementation and enforcement of this Agreement, and the parties hereto
irrevocably submit and consent to such jurisdiction. Until the commencement of
the Bankruptcy Case or if the Bankruptcy Case has closed, the Parties agree to
unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
state or federal court located in the State of Nevada and any appellate court
from any thereof, for the resolution of any such claim or dispute. The Parties
hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of such dispute, waiving thereby their right to any other
jurisdiction to which they may be entitled to by reason of their present or
future domiciles or otherwise. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a
judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties hereby consents to process being served by any Party
in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 12.7_.

 



 

12.4 **_WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY_** **. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, MATTER OR PROCEEDING
REGARDING THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF**.

 



 

12.5 _Entire Agreement; Amendments; Waivers_. This Agreement (including the
Schedules and exhibits hereto and the certificates delivered hereunder) and
the Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding and agreement
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement
can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be
waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The
waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such Party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other
remedies provided by law.

 



 

12.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and to the extent not inconsistent with
the Bankruptcy Code, the laws of the State of Nevada applicable to contracts
made and performed in such State, without giving effect to conflict of laws
principles thereof.

 



 

12.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by
hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) when sent by facsimile (with
written confirmation of transmission) or (c) one (1) Business Day following
the day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of receipt), in

all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the

Purchasers rights to purchase the

 



      
 

 



 

Purchased Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities and Purchasers rights to
seek indemnification hereunder) to any Affiliate of Purchaser. Upon any such
permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall also
apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

 



 

12.10 _Non-Recourse_. The Parties acknowledge that (i) none of the members of
the Company, (ii) none of the members of the Companys Executive Committee,
(iii) none of the members of the Companys Transaction Committee or Special

member, employee, incorporator, member, partner or direct or indirect equity

committee member, employee, incorporator, member, partner, Affiliate or direct
or indirect equity holder of Purchaser (such individuals described in _clauses
(i)-(v)_ above, the " _Non-Recourse Parties_ ") is a party to this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement. The Parties further acknowledge that none of the
Non-Recourse Parties, whether individually or collectively, shall have any
liability whatsoever of any kind or description for any obligations or
liabilities of the Company under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Accordingly, the Parties hereby agree that in
the event (a) there is any alleged breach or alleged default or breach or
default by any Party under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements
or (b) any Party has or may have any claim arising from or relating to the
terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, no Party shall, or shall
have any right to, commence any proceedings or otherwise seek to impose any
liability or obligation whatsoever of any kind or description on or against
the Non-Recourse Parties, whether collectively or individually, by reason of
such alleged breach, default or claim.

12.12 _Schedules_. The Parties may, at their respective options, include in
the Schedules or the Purchaser Schedules, as the case may be, items that are
not material to avoid any misunderstanding or for any other reason, and such
inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts, shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or representation that such items are material, to establish
any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

12.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

 



 

12.14 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. (a) Except as provided in clause (b)
below and as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including,
without limitation, in _Section 12.10_), this Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express
or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other Person any legal or

 



      
 

 



 

equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Debt
Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of _Section
4.7(c)_, _Section 8.3(c)_, _Section 12.2(b)_, _Section 12.3_, _Section
