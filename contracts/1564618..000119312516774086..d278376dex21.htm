WHEREAS, IBG desires to acquire all of the issued and outstanding voting and
nonvoting common shares of CBI (the " _CBI Shares_ ") through the merger (the

to receive common shares of IBG (the " _IBG Shares_ ") as provided for
herein;

WHEREAS, IBG and CBI believe that the Merger, as provided for and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and all exhibits,

their respective shareholders;

 

WHEREAS, after the Merger, IBG will effect the merger of Northstar Bank with

WHEREAS, the parties intend that: (i) the Merger will qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of §368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, (ii) that the Bank Merger qualify as a reorganization within the

1 WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of IBG and CBI have approved this
Agreement and the proposed transactions substantially on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

AGREEMENT:

 

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be bound
hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

ACQUISITION OF CBI BY IBG

Section 1.01. _Merger of CBI with and into IBG_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, CBI will merge with and into IBG pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 10 and Chapter 21 of the Texas Business
Organizations Code (the " _TBOC_ ").

 

Section 1.02. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 10.008 of the TBOC. After the Merger, IBG shall continue
as the corporation resulting from the Merger (the " _Resulting Corporation_
"), and the separate corporate existence of CBI shall cease. The name of the
Resulting Corporation shall be "Independent Bank Group, Inc." The existing
principal office and facilities of IBG immediately preceding the Merger shall
be the principal office and facilities of the Resulting Corporation after the
Merger. At the Effective Time, all rights, title and interests to all real
estate and other property owned by each of IBG and CBI shall be allocated to
and vested in the Resulting Corporation without reversion or impairment,
without further act or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having
occurred, but subject to any existing liens or encumbrances thereon. At the
Effective Time, all liabilities and obligations of IBG and CBI shall be
allocated to the Resulting Corporation, and the Resulting Corporation shall be
the primary obligor therefor, and no other party to the Merger shall be
liable therefor. At the Effective Time, a proceeding pending by or against
either IBG or CBI may be continued as if the Merger did not occur, or the
Resulting Corporation may be substituted in the proceedings.

Section 1.03. _Certificate of Formation and Bylaws_. As a result of
the Merger, the Certificate of Formation and Bylaws, each as amended, of IBG
shall continue in effect as the Certificate of Formation and Bylaws of the
Resulting Corporation until the same shall be amended and changed as provided
by applicable law.

 

Section 1.04. _Directors and Executive Officers_. Subject to the election
of the CBI Nominees as contemplated in Section 6.16, the directors and
executive officers of IBG as of the Effective Time, shall be the directors and
executive officers of the Resulting Corporation, and such directors and
executive officers shall hold office from the Effective Time until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the
manner provided in the Certificate of Formation and Bylaws of the Resulting
Corporation or as otherwise provided by applicable law.

 



2 Section 1.05. _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time by virtue of
this Agreement and without any further action on the part of any holder, all
of the CBI Shares outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive IBG Shares, as calculated and subject to
adjustment as set forth in this Section 1.05 and Section 9.01(K) (the "
_Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ").

A. Any CBI Shares that are owned by CBI (other than as a fiduciary) shall
automatically be canceled and retired and all rights with respect thereto
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

B. Each CBI Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time (excluding CBI Shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.05(A) or held by a
Dissenting Shareholder) shall be converted into, and shall be canceled in
exchange for, the right to receive a fraction of an IBG Share, rounded to the
nearest ten thousandth, equal to the quotient of (a) the quotient of (i) the
Shareholder Value, _divided by_ (ii) number of CBI Shares issued and
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, _divided by_ (b) the
Average Closing Price (the " _CBI Share Exchange Ratio_ ").

 

" _Shareholder Value_ " shall mean the difference between (i) the Deal Value,
_less_ (ii) the Aggregate Option Holder Payment (as defined in Section
1.13(B)(2)).

" _Deal Value_ " shall mean the product of the (i) Gross Share Number, 
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Average Closing Price.

" _Gross Share Number_ " shall mean the quotient of (i) $434,000,000, 
_divided by_ (i) $47.40.

" _Average Closing Price_ " shall mean the average of the daily volume-
weighted average sales price per IBG Share on the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.
Global Select Market System (the " _NASDAQ_ "), for the twenty consecutive
trading days ending on and including the third trading day preceding the
Closing Date, as reported by Bloomberg.

1. If the Tangible Equity (as defined below) on the fifth business day preceding the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2.01) (the " _Calculation Date_ ") is less than $200,000,000, then the $434,000,000 figure used to calculate the Gross Share Number in Section 1.05(B) above shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between (i) $200,000,000, minus (ii) the Tangible Equity on the Calculation Date. 

C. Subject only to dissenters rights under Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of
the TBOC at the Effective Time, all CBI Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall be cancelled and retired and all rights with respect thereto shall
cease to exist, and each holder of CBI Shares (a " _CBI Shareholder_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
consideration provided for in this Section 1.05. Certificates previously
representing CBI Shares will be exchanged for the Merger Consideration upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with Section 2.05, without
interest thereon.

 

D. In connection with the Merger, CBI may distribute to its shareholders a
total of up to $55,250,000 (the " _Maximum Distribution Amount_ ") prior to
the Effective Time, a portion of which may be in the form of a return of
capital distribution to its shareholders during

 



3  the fourth quarter of 2016 (the " _Return of Capital Distribution_ "). In
addition, if the Tangible Equity on the Calculation Date is greater than
$200,000,000, then CBI may make an additional distribution to its
shareholders on the day prior to the Closing Date in an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) the difference between (x) the Maximum Distribution Amount,
minus (y) the aggregate amount of the Return of Capital Distribution, or (ii)
the difference between (x) the actual amount of Tangible Equity on the
Calculation Date, less (y) $200,000,000. For clarification, the amount that
CBI may distribute to its shareholders prior to the Effective Time may
not exceed $55,250,000 regardless of the amount of Tangible Equity on the
Calculation Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Closing
Date has not occurred on or prior to June 30, 2017, the Maximum Distribution
Amount shall be increased by an amount equal to the consolidated net income
of CBI, calculated in accordance with GAAP, for the period commencing on June
1, 2017 and continuing through the Calculation Date. The aggregate amount
distributed by CBI to the CBI Shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.05(D)
is referred to as the " _Section 1.05(D) Distribution Amount_."

 

E. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Tangible Equity_ " means the tangible
shareholders equity of CBI as determined from CBIs financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently applied. The following items shall have been paid or properly
accrued for, on an after tax basis, in the calculation of Tangible Equity:

1. All professional fees incurred by CBI and any CBI Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, and similar costs and expenses; 

 

2. Costs and fees associated with the termination and de-conversion of material contracts of CBI and any CBI Subsidiary, including their respective data processing and other IT contracts, all as set forth on _Confidential Schedule 1.05(E)(2)_ ; 

 

3. All payments owed under the Employment Contracts (as defined in Section 3.20, and all other payments, if any, made to directors, officers and employees related to the consummation of the Merger; and 

4. The premium for DandO insurance tail coverage contemplated under Section 5.21; and 

5. The portion of the payroll and income tax owed by CBI resulting from the cashout on a "net settlement" basis, of the Options as provided for in Section 1.13. 

 

Unrealized gains and losses on CBIs investment securities shall be excluded
from the calculation of Tangible Equity.

 

CBI shall, at least three business days before the Closing Date, provide IBG
with a calculation of Tangible Equity as of the Calculation Date. If IBG
disagrees with such calculation of Tangible Equity, CBI and IBG shall meet to
resolve any such disagreement. If CBI and IBG cannot resolve any such
disagreement, then an independent accounting firm mutually agreed to by IBG
and CBI shall resolve any such disagreement which resolution shall be final
and binding upon CBI and IBG. _Confidential Schedule 1.05(E)_ sets forth the
method of calculation and, by way of example only, a preliminary estimate of
Tangible Equity.

 



4 F. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, IBG
will not issue any certificates or scrip representing fractional IBG Shares
otherwise issuable pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional shares, IBG shall pay to each former holder of CBI Shares otherwise
entitled to receive such fractional share an amount of cash determined by
multiplying (i) the Average Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of an IBG Share
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 1.05.

 

Section 1.06. _Treatment of IBG Shares_. Each IBG Share outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, on and after the Effective
Time, remain issued and outstanding as one share of common stock of IBG as the
corporation surviving the Merger.

 

Section 1.07. _Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, CBI Shares that are held by shareholders of CBI
who have complied with the terms and provisions of Subchapter H of Chapter 10
of the TBOC (each a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") shall be entitled to those
rights and remedies set forth in Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC; but
if a shareholder of CBI fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any
such right or remedy granted by the Subchapter H of Chapter 10 of the TBOC,
each CBI Share held by such shareholder shall be converted into and represent
only the right to receive the consideration as specified in Section 1.05.

Section 1.08. _SEC Filing and Shareholder Approval_.

A. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, IBG
shall prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or other applicable form
(the " _Registration Statement_ ") to be filed by IBG with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") in connection with the issuance of the
IBG Shares to the CBI Shareholders pursuant to Section 1.05 (including the
Proxy Statement for the shareholder meetings of IBG and CBI and prospectus and
other proxy solicitation materials constituting a part thereof (together, the
" _Proxy Statement_ ") and all related documents). CBI shall prepare and
furnish to IBG such information relating to CBI and its directors, officers
and shareholders as may be reasonably required to comply with SEC rules and
regulations in connection with the Registration Statement. IBG shall provide
CBI, and its legal, financial and accounting advisors, the right to review and
provide comments upon (i) the Registration Statement in advance of such
Registration Statement being filed with the SEC and (ii) on all amendments
and supplements to the Registration Statement and all responses to requests
for additional information and replies to comments relating to the
Registration Statement before filing or submission to the SEC. IBG
shall consider in good faith all comments from CBI and its legal, financial
and accounting advisors to the Registration Statement, all amendments and
supplements thereto and all responses to requests for additional information.
CBI agrees to cooperate with IBG and IBGs counsel and accountants in
requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its
financial advisor and independent auditor and in taking such other actions in
connection with the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. If CBI
has cooperated and promptly provided information required to be delivered by
it for inclusion in the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement as required
by this Section 1.08(A) and Section 5.02, IBG shall file, or cause to be
filed, the Registration

 



5  Statement with the SEC on or before January 16, 2017. IBG shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing
thereof. IBG also agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

B. The Board of Directors of CBI (the " _CBI Board_ ") shall duly call,
give notice of, and cause to be held, a meeting of its shareholders (the "

Proxy Statement is on file with the SEC before such mailing.

 

C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CBI and the CBI Board are permitted to
change its recommendation as contemplated by this Section 1.08(C) (" _Change
in Recommendation_ ") if and only to the extent that:

1. CBI, the CBI Subsidiaries and the CBI Representatives (as defined in Section 5.10), have complied in all material respects with Section 5.10; 

 

2. the CBI Board, after consultation with its outside counsel, has determined in good faith that failure to make a Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and 

 

3. if the CBI Board intends to make a Change in Recommendation after CBI has received an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.10(D)), (a) the CBI Board has concluded in good faith, after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by IBG pursuant to subclause (c) below, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 5.10(E)), (b) CBI shall notify IBG, at least five business days in advance, of its intention to make a Change in Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal) and furnish to IBG a written description of the material terms of the Superior Proposal and copies of such other material documents that CBI is not required to keep confidential, and (c) before making such a Change in Recommendation, CBI shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the period after CBIs delivery of the notice referred to in subclause (b) above, negotiate with IBG in good faith for a period of up to five business days (to the extent IBG desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. 

 



6 D. The Board of Directors of IBG (the " _IBG Board_ ") shall duly call,

the mailing (at its expense) of the Proxy Statement to its shareholders on or
before the fifth business day after the date that the Registration Statement
is declared effective and a final prospectus (relating to the Registration
Statement) and Proxy Statement is on file with the SEC before such mailing.

thereon is declared with a record date within said period, the CBI Share
Exchange Ratio and any dependent items shall be adjusted accordingly to
provide to the CBI Shareholders the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action; but an offering or sale of IBG Shares

respect to the Options and the Restricted Shares.

 

A. _ _Vesting__. Pursuant to Section 12 of the CBI Award Plan, the

B. _ _Options__. The Administrator shall effectuate the automatic cashout
and termination of the Options on the following basis:

1. Each holder of an Option (an " _Option Holder_ ") shall be entitled to receive, for each share of CBI common stock underlying their respective Option (an " _Option Share_ "), an amount equal to the difference between (i) the Closing Date Fair Market Value, _minus_ (ii) the applicable Option Share exercise price as set forth on Confidential Schedule 3.03(C) (the " _Per Option Share Price_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Closing Date Fair Market Value_ " shall mean the quotient of (x) the sum of (1) the aggregate number of shares of IBG Shares to be issued pursuant to Section 1.05(B) (as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 1.05(B)(1) and Section 9.01(K) but without giving effect to the clause "less the Aggregate Option Holder Payment (as defined in 1.13(B)(2) below)" contained in Section 1.05(B)), _multiplied by_ the Average Closing Price, _plus_ (2) an amount equal to the portion of the Section 1.05(D) Distribution that is not a Return of Capital Distribution, _plus_ (3) the aggregate exercise price to be paid to exercise the Options as set forth on Confidential Schedule 3.03(C), _divided by_ (y) the number of CBI Shares issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, plus the number of Option Shares outstanding and unexercised as of such date. 

2. Within five (5) business days following the Closing Date, IBG shall pay to each Option Holder an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Per Option Share Price, _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of Option Shares held by such Option Holder (the " _Option Holder Payment_ "). The aggregate Option Holder Payment paid to all of the Option Holders is referred to as the " _Aggregate Option Holder Payment_." 

 

3. The Option Holder Payment shall be subject to applicable payroll, federal, state, and local income tax withholding and, as a result, the amount of the Option Holder Payment shall be reduced by the applicable total tax withholding, and IBG shall deliver such withheld amount to the applicable taxing authority. 

 

4. In connection with the cashout of the Options and prior to Closing, CBI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a written acknowledgement signed by each Option Holder stating that their Option will be cancelled in exchange for the Option Holder Payment and that they will have no further right to purchase CBI Shares or any other right with respect to their Options.

Section 2.05. _Exchange Procedures_.

 



12 A. On the business day before the Closing Date, IBG shall deposit or
cause to be deposited in trust with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") certificates for shares or evidence of shares in book entry form
representing the aggregate number of IBG Shares which the holders of CBI
Shares are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.05.

B. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, with the intent to be
within five business days after the Effective Time, IBG shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder
of an outstanding certificate or certificates representing CBI Shares (the "
_Certificates_ "), a form letter of transmittal which will specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and contain instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates for payment therefor. The form and substance of the letter of
transmittal and any associated cover letter shall be mutually acceptable to
IBG and CBI before such transmittal materials are mailed to the holders of
the Certificates. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal properly completed and duly executed
(the " _Transmittal Materials_ "), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a number of IBG Shares equal to
the product of (x) the CBI Share Exchange Ratio, _multiplied by_ (y) the
number of CBI Shares represented by the Certificate (the " _Surrendered
Shares_ "), and (ii) an amount of cash as payment in lieu of the issuance of
fractional IBG Shares calculated in accordance with Section 1.05(F), and such
Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. The consideration to be received by
a CBI Shareholder upon surrender of his Certificate is referred to as the "
_Merger Consideration_." Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
2.05, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing CBI Shares held
by Dissenting Shareholders) shall represent for all purposes the right to
receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. Promptly after
receipt of the Transmittal Materials, IBG will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to review the Transmittal Materials in
order to verify proper completion and execution thereof. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time and the surrender of a Certificate to the
Exchange Agent, together with properly completed and executed Transmittal
Materials, IBG will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange
Agent to promptly deliver the Merger Consideration.

 

C. After the Effective Time, the share transfer ledger of CBI shall be
closed and there shall be no transfers on the share transfer books of CBI of
the CBI Shares which were outstanding immediately before such time of filing.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to IBG, they shall be
promptly presented to the Exchange Agent and exchanged as provided in this
Section 2.05.

D. Former shareholders of CBI shall be entitled to vote after the Effective
Time at any meeting of IBGs shareholders the number of IBG Shares into which
their shares are converted, regardless of whether such shareholders of CBI
have surrendered their Certificates in exchange therefor.

 

E. No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to IBG Shares and payable to the holders thereof shall be paid
to the holder of a Certificate until such holder surrenders such Certificate
to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.05. After the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.05, 

 



13  the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without interest thereon, which had become payable after the
Effective Time with respect to the IBG Shares represented by such
Certificate.

F. Any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of CBI for six months after the Exchange Agent mails the letter
of transmittal pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be delivered to IBG upon
demand, and any shareholders of CBI who have not theretofore complied with
the exchange procedures in this Section 2.05 shall look to IBG only, and not
the Exchange Agent, for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of
such shares. If outstanding Certificates for CBI Shares are not surrendered
or the payment for them is not claimed before the date on which such IBG
Shares or cash would otherwise escheat to any governmental unit or agency, the
unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property or any
other applicable law, become the property of IBG (and to the extent not in its
possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest
of any person previously entitled to such property.

 

G. If any IBG Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
appropriately endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form (reasonably satisfactory to IBG) for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a certificate representing IBG Shares in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or not payable.

 

H. None of IBG, CBI, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of CBI Shares for any IBG Share (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

I. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by IBG or the Exchange Agent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as IBG or the Exchange
Agent may direct (not to exceed the amount of Merger Consideration relating
to the relevant missing Certificate) as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against IBG, Independent Bank, or CBI with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations and policies of any Government
Authority (as defined in Section 11.10), except where the failure, whether

Section 3.15. _Insurance_. _Confidential Schedule 3.15_  contains a
complete list of all policies of insurance, including fidelity and bond
insurance, maintained as of the date of this Agreement by CBI or any CBI
Subsidiary. All such policies (A) are sufficient for compliance by CBI and
each CBI Subsidiary, in all material respects, with all requirements of
applicable law and all agreements to which CBI and each CBI Subsidiary are
parties, (B) are valid, outstanding and enforceable, except as enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, conservatorship, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization, receivership, or similar laws and judicial decisions affecting
the rights of creditors generally and by general principles of equity (whether

force and effect, and, except as set

 



23  forth in _Confidential Schedule 3.15_ , no written notice has been received
of the cancellation, or threatened or proposed cancellation, of any such
policy and there are no unpaid premiums due thereon. Neither CBI nor any CBI
Subsidiary is in default with respect to the material provisions of any such
policy or has failed to give any notice or present any known claim thereunder
in a due and timely fashion. Each material Property of CBI and each CBI
Subsidiary is insured for the benefit of CBI and such CBI Subsidiary in
amounts deemed adequate by CBIs and each CBI Subsidiarys respective
management against risks customarily insured against. Except as set forth in 
_Confidential Schedule 3.15_ , there have been no claims under any fidelity
bonds of CBI or any CBI Subsidiary since June 30, 2013 and to the Best
Knowledge of CBI, there are no facts that would reasonably be expected to form
the basis of a claim under such bonds.

Section 3.16. _No Material Adverse Change_. Except as disclosed in
the representations and warranties made in this ARTICLE III and the
_Confidential Schedules_ hereto, there has not been any Material Adverse
Change with respect to CBI or any CBI Subsidiary since June 30, 2016, nor to

Change with respect to CBI or any CBI Subsidiary.

application, trademark right, trade name, service name, service mark,
copyright or any trade secret (collectively, " _Proprietary Rights_ ") for
the business or operations of CBI and any CBI Subsidiary that are not owned,
held or licensed by CBI or such CBI Subsidiary. Neither CBI nor any CBI
Subsidiary has received within the past three years any written notice
of infringement of or conflict with the rights of others with respect to the
use by CBI or such CBI Subsidiary of Proprietary Rights, and there is no claim
or action by any such person pending or, to the Best Knowledge of CBI,
threatened, with respect thereto.

nor is CBI or any CBI Subsidiary a debtor to any such person other than as
part of the normal and customary terms of such persons employment or service
as a director with CBI or any CBI Subsidiary. Except as disclosed on
_Confidential Schedule 3.18_ neither CBI nor any CBI Subsidiary uses any asset
owned by any shareholder or any present or former director or officer of CBI
or any CBI Subsidiary, or any Affiliate thereof, in the operations (other
than personal belongings of such officers and directors located in the
Northstar Banks premises, the removal of which would not result in a Material
Adverse Change), nor do any of such persons own or have the right to use real
property that is adjacent to property on which Northstar Banks facilities are
located. Except as disclosed on _Confidential Schedule 3.18_ , neither CBI nor
any CBI Subsidiary is a party to any transaction or agreement with any
director or officer (or their respective Affiliates) of CBI or any CBI

Section 3.19. _Evidences of Indebtedness_. All evidences of indebtedness
that are reflected as assets of CBI or any CBI Subsidiary are legal, valid and
binding obligations of the respective obligors thereof, enforceable in

24  limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws affecting creditors generally and the availability of injunctive
relief, specific performance and other equitable remedies), and are not
subject to any asserted or, to the Best Knowledge of CBI, threatened,
defenses, offsets or counterclaims that may reasonably be asserted against
CBI, any CBI Subsidiary or the present holder thereof. The credit
and collateral files of Northstar Bank contain all material information
(excluding general, local or national industry, economic or similar
conditions) actually known to CBI or Northstar Bank that is required to
evaluate, in accordance with generally prevailing practices in the banking
industry, the collectability of the loan portfolio of Northstar Bank
(including loans that will be outstanding if Northstar Bank advances funds it
is obligated to advance), except for items identified on Northstar Banks
internal exception list which has been made available to IBG. All loans
classified substandard, doubtful, loss, nonperforming or problem loans
internally by management of Northstar Bank or any applicable Regulatory Agency
(as defined in Section 11.10) are set forth on Northstar Banks watch list as

received notice of, any past or present conditions, events, activities,
practices or incidents that may result in a violation of any Environmental Law

indebtedness reflected as an asset of Northstar Bank. With respect to any
loan or other evidence of indebtedness all or a portion of which has been sold
to or guaranteed by any governmental authority, including the Small Business
Administration, each of such loans was made in compliance and conformity with
all relevant laws, rules, regulations and procedures such that such
governmental authoritys guaranty of such loan is effective during the term of
such loan in all material respects. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section, no representation or warranty is being
made as to the sufficiency of collateral securing, or the collectability of,
the loans of Northstar Bank.

 

Section 3.20. _Employee Relationships_. CBI and each CBI Subsidiary has
complied in all material respects with all applicable laws relating to its
relationships with their respective employees, and CBI and each CBI Subsidiary
reasonably believes that the relationship between CBI or any CBI Subsidiary
and its respective employees is good. To the Best Knowledge of CBI, no key
executive officer or manager of any of the operations of CBI or any CBI
Subsidiary or any group of employees of CBI or any CBI Subsidiary has or have
any present plans to terminate their employment. _Confidential Schedule 3.20_

with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

before the National Labor Relations Board and no similar claims pending
before any similar state or local or foreign agency. There is no activity or
proceeding of any labor organization (or

 



25  representative thereof) or employee group to organize any employees of CBI
or any CBI Subsidiary, nor of any strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts
or threats thereof, by or with respect to any such employees. CBI and each
CBI Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment and wages and hours, and neither CBI nor any CBI Subsidiary is
engaged in any unfair labor practice.

Properties, except as would not be expected to have or cause a Material
Adverse Change. The use that CBI or any CBI Subsidiary makes of the Properties

disposal or release of any Hazardous Material on, in or from any of the
Properties, except as would not be expected to have or cause a Material
Adverse Change.

 

D. There is no action, suit, proceeding, investigation, or inquiry before
any Governmental Authority pending or, to the Best Knowledge of CBI,

be liable in any way under any Environmental Laws or requesting information to
enable such a determination to be made).

Section 3.24. _Absence of Certain Business Practices_. Neither CBI nor any
CBI Subsidiary nor, to the Best Knowledge of CBI, any of their respective
officers, employees or agents, nor, to the Best Knowledge of CBI, any other
person acting on their behalf, has, directly or indirectly, since June 30,
2013, given or agreed to give any gift or similar benefit to any customer,
supplier, governmental employee or other person who is or may be in a position
to help or hinder the business of CBI or any CBI Subsidiary (or assist CBI or
any CBI Subsidiary in connection with any actual or proposed transaction)
that (A) may reasonably be expected to subject CBI or any CBI Subsidiary to
any damage or penalty in any civil, criminal or governmental litigation or
proceeding, (B) if not given in the past, may reasonably have resulted in a
Material Adverse Change or (C) if not continued in the future may reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

CBI Subsidiary has performed in all material respects all of its duties as a
trustee, custodian, guardian or as an escrow agent in a manner that complies
in all material respects with all applicable laws, regulations, orders,

perform would result in a Material Adverse Change.

Section 3.28. _Guaranties_. Except in the ordinary course of business,
according to past business practices and in material compliance with
applicable law, CBI or the CBI Subsidiaries have not guaranteed the
obligations or liabilities of any other person, firm or corporation.

Section 3.29. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

A. Set forth on _Confidential Schedule 3.29_ is a complete and correct list
of all "employee benefit plans" (as defined in ERISA), all specified fringe
benefit plans as defined in Code § 6039D, and all other bonus, incentive,
compensation, deferred compensation, profit sharing, stock option, stock
appreciation right, stock bonus, stock purchase, employee stock ownership,
savings, severance, supplemental unemployment, layoff, salary continuation,
retirement, pension, health, life insurance, disability, group insurance,
vacation, holiday, sick leave, fringe benefit or welfare plan, or any other
similar plan, agreement, policy or understanding (whether written or oral,
qualified or nonqualified), and any trust, escrow or other agreement related
thereto, which (a) is currently maintained or contributed to by CBI or any
CBI Subsidiary, or with respect to which CBI or any CBI Subsidiary has any
liability, and (b) provides benefits to any officer, employee, service
provider, former officer or former employee of CBI or any CBI Subsidiary, or
the dependents of any thereof, regardless of whether funded or unfunded
(herein collectively the " _Employee Plans_ " and each individually an "
_Employee Plan_ ").

 

B. No Employee Plan is a defined benefit plan within the meaning of ERISA.
CBI has delivered or made available to IBG true, accurate and complete copies
of the documents comprising each Employee Plan and any related trust
agreements, annuity contracts, insurance policies or any other funding
instruments (" _Funding Arrangements_ "), any contracts with independent
contractors (including actuaries and investment managers) that relate to any
Employee Plan, the Form 5500 filed with the IRS in each of the three (3) most
recent plan years with respect to each Employee Plan, and related
schedules and opinions, and such other documents, records or other materials
related thereto, as reasonably requested by IBG. There have been no prohibited
transactions (described under ERISA §406 or Code §4975(c)), breaches of
fiduciary duty or any other breaches or violations of any law applicable to
the Employee Plans and related Funding Arrangements that would reasonably be
expected to subject IBG, Independent Bank, CBI or any CBI Subsidiary to any
material taxes, penalties or other liabilities. Each Employee Plan that is
represented to be qualified under Code §401(a) has a current favorable
determination or opinion letter. All reports, descriptions and filings
required by the Code, ERISA or any government agency with respect to each
Employee Plan have been timely and completely filed or distributed. Each
Employee Plan has been operated in material compliance with applicable law or
in accordance with its terms. There are no pending claims, lawsuits or
actions relating to any Employee Plan (other than ordinary course claims for
benefits)

 



28  and, to the Best Knowledge of CBI, none are threatened. No written or, to
the Best Knowledge of CBI, oral representations have been made by CBI or any
CBI Subsidiary to any employee or former employee of CBI or any CBI
Subsidiary promising or guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for the
continuation of medical, dental, life or disability coverage for such person,
their dependent, or any beneficiary for any period of time beyond the end of
the current plan year or beyond termination of employment (except to the
extent of coverage required under Code §4980B or applicable state law).
Compliance with FAS 106 will not create any material change to the Financial
Statements or the Call Reports. There are no material surrender charges,
penalties, or other costs or fees that would reasonably be expected to be
imposed by any person against CBI, any CBI Subsidiary, an Employee Plan, or
any other person, including an Employee Plan participant or beneficiary, as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with respect to any insurance, annuity or investment contracts or other
similar investment held by any Employee Plan.

 

C. With respect to each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA)
maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to, currently or
in the past six (6) years, by any trade or business with which CBI or any CBI
Subsidiary is required by any of the rules contained in the Code or ERISA to
be treated as a single employer (" _Controlled Group Plans_ "):

1. All Controlled Group Plans which are "group health plans" (as defined in the Code and ERISA) have been operated before the Closing such that failures to operate such group health plans in compliance, in all material respects, with Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title 1 of ERISA and Code § § 4980B and 4980D would not reasonably be expected to subject CBI or any CBI Subsidiary to material liability; 

 

2. There is no Controlled Group Plan that is a defined benefit plan (as defined in ERISA), nor has there been a Controlled Group Plan that is a defined benefit plan in the last five (5) calendar years; and 

3. There is no Controlled Group Plan that is a "multiple employer plan" or "multi-employer plan" (as either such term is defined in ERISA), nor has there been a Controlled Group Plan that is either a multiple employer plan or multi-employer plan since 2007. 

D. All Employee Plan documents, annual reports or returns, audited or
audited financial statements, actuarial valuations, summary annual reports,
and summary plan descriptions issued with respect to the Employee Plans are
correct, complete, and current in all material respects, have been timely
filed, and there have been no material changes in the information set forth
therein.

E. All contributions (including all employer contributions,
employee salary reduction contributions and all premiums or other payments
(other than claims)) that are due have been made with respect to each Employee
Plan.

severance or termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or benefit
plan currently in effect will be an "excess parachute payment" (as such term
is defined in Code §280G(b)(1)) solely as a result of the transactions

Northstar Bank has any agreement with any other person or entity for data

Northstar Bank and the use thereof is in compliance with all applicable laws,

or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic,
mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) which
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of CBI, the CBI Subsidiaries or their
accountants and consultants, except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls
described in the preceding sentence.

 



31 Section 3.42. _Indemnification_. Except as set forth on  _Confidential
Schedule 3.42_ , to the knowledge of CBI, no action or failure to take action
by any present or former director, officer, employee or agent of CBI or any
CBI Subsidiary has occurred which would give rise to a material claim by
any such individual for indemnification from CBI or any CBI Subsidiary.

Section 3.43. _Organization and Qualification of the Trusts_. CBI has two
special purpose trust subsidiaries, Northstar Statutory Trust II and Northstar
Statutory Trust III (collectively, the " _Trusts_ "). With respect to the
Trusts:

 

A. The Trusts have issued and sold capital securities (the " _Capital
Securities_ ") and common securities (the " _Common Securities_ ") under an
Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (the " _Trust Agreement_ "), and CBI
has issued to the Trusts, Floating Rate or Fixed/Floating Rate Junior
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (" _Debentures_ "), under an
Indenture (the Trusts Indenture and Trust Agreement are collectively referred
to as its " _Operative Documents_ "). _Confidential Schedule 3.43_ sets forth,
with respect to the Trusts, the (i) dates of the respective Trust Agreements
and Indentures, (ii) aggregate liquidation value of the respective Capital
Securities, (iii) aggregate liquidation value of the respective Common
Securities, (iv) aggregate amount of Debentures that have been issued to each
Trust by CBI, (v) the rate paid on the respective Capital Securities, the
Common Securities and the Debentures (collectively, the " _Securities_ "),
(vi) the dates after which CBI may redeem the respective Debentures at par,
and (vii) the maturity date of the respective Debentures.

B. The Trusts have been duly created and each is validly existing in good
standing as a statutory trust under the laws of the State of Delaware with the
power and authority to own property and to conduct the business it transacts
and proposes to transact and to enter into and perform its obligations under
the Operative Documents. Each Trust is not a party to or otherwise bound by
any material agreement other than the Operative Documents and a Placement
Agreement of even date with the Trust Agreement. Each Trust is and will, be
classified for tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association
taxable as a corporation.

 

C. The Capital Securities and the Common Securities have been duly
authorized by the respective Trust Agreements, have been validly issued and
represent undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the respective
Trusts. None of the Capital Securities or the Common Securities is subject to
preemptive or other similar rights. All of the outstanding Common Securities
are directly owned by CBI free and clear of any pledge, security interest,
claim, lien or other encumbrance, and have been issued in compliance with
applicable federal and state securities laws. The Common Securities satisfy
the eligibility requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3) issued under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. Neither CBI nor any Trust is an "investment company"
or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," in each case within the
meaning of Section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
without regard to Section 3(c) of that act. The Debentures are not held of
record by shareholders of CBI or any CBI Subsidiary.

 



32 D. The sole assets of each Trust are its Debentures, any interest paid
on such Debentures to the extent not distributed, proceeds of such
Debentures, or any of the foregoing.

E. All of the proceeds from the sale of the Capital Securities issued by
each Trust have been invested in its respective Debentures. All of the
proceeds from the sale of the Common Securities issued by each Trust have been
invested in the respective Debentures. All Debentures are and have been held
by each Trust since their initial issuance.

F. Neither Trust was not formed to, and is not authorized to, conduct any
trade or business and neither Trust has conducted any trade or business since
it was formed. The Trusts exist for the exclusive purposes of (i) issuing and
selling its respective Capital Securities and Common Securities, (ii) using
the proceeds from the sale of its respective Capital Securities and Common
Securities to acquire its respective Debentures, and (iii) engaging only in
activities necessary, advisable or incidental thereto. Each Trust was formed
to facilitate direct investment in the assets of such Trust, and the existence
of multiple classes of ownership is incidental to that purpose. There is no
intent to provide holders of such interests in each Trust with diverse
interests in the assets of each Trust.

G. CBI has not exercised its right to defer interest payments on the
Debentures.

 

H. Each Trusts income consists solely of payments made by CBI with respect
to the respective Debentures, and such payments are not derived from the
active conduct of a financial business by such Trust. Both CBIs obligation to
make those payments and the amounts thereof are set forth in the respective
Debentures. Neither CBIs obligation to make those payments nor the amounts
payable by CBI is dependent on income or profits of CBI or any Affiliate of
CBI (although CBIs ability to do so is so dependent).

 

I. CBI has not issued any class of capital shares either pari passu or
senior to the Debentures. All Debentures are either pari passu or senior to
CBIs trade accounts payable arising in the ordinary course of business.

 

J. CBI and the Trusts have created a debtor-creditor relationship between
CBI, as debtor, and each Trust, as a creditor, and CBI and the Trusts have
treated the Debentures as indebtedness for all tax purposes.

Section 3.44. _Representations Not Misleading_. No representation or
warranty by CBI contained in this Agreement contains or will contain on the
Closing Date any untrue statement of a material fact or omits or will omit on
the Closing Date to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
contained herein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. To the Best Knowledge of CBI, all written statements,
exhibits, schedules, and other documents furnished to IBG by CBI or any CBI
Subsidiary as part of the due diligence for this Agreement are accurate in all
material respects.

liabilities of such person;

by applicable law, CBI shall afford the officers, directors, employees,
attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and authorized representatives of
IBG full access during regular business hours to all of the books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records of CBI and each CBI Subsidiary, and
furnish to IBG during such period all such information concerning CBI and each
CBI Subsidiary and their affairs as IBG may reasonably request, so that IBG
may have full opportunity to make such reasonable investigation as it
shall desire to make of the affairs of CBI and each CBI Subsidiary, including
access sufficient to verify the value of the assets and the liabilities of CBI
and each CBI Subsidiary and the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to
IBGs obligations described in ARTICLE VIII; provided, however, that IBG
shall request permission for all such access reasonably in advance and all
such access shall be conducted in a manner designed to minimize disruption to
the normal business operations and employee or customer relations of

 



44  CBI and each CBI Subsidiary. CBI agrees at any time, and from time to time,
to furnish to IBG as soon as practicable, any additional information that IBG
may reasonably request, and shall specifically provide to IBG a weekly
written report of all loans made, renewed or modified by Northstar Bank. No
investigation by IBG or its representatives shall affect the representations
and warranties set forth herein; provided, however, that IBG shall promptly
notify CBI to the extent that IBGs investigation determines that any of the
representations and warranties by CBI set forth in ARTICLE III are untrue.

 

Section 5.06. _Allowance for Loan Losses_. CBI shall cause Northstar Bank
to maintain its Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (the " _Allowance_ ") at
a level consistent with Northstar Banks historical methodology and in
compliance with GAAP and RAP, and at a minimum, maintain its Allowance at a
level equal to at least $15,675,000 (the " _Minimum Allowance Amount_ ");
_provided, however,_ that if the Allowance is less than the Minimum Allowance
Amount on the Calculation Date, Northstar Bank shall take or cause to be taken
all action necessary to increase the Allowance to an amount equal to the
Minimum Allowance Amount as of the Closing Date. The calculation of Tangible
Equity shall include (as a deduction) the amount of any provision expense made
by Northstar Bank necessary to maintain the Allowance equal to the Minimum
Allowance Amount.

Section 5.07. _Untrue Representations_. CBI shall promptly notify IBG in
writing if CBI becomes aware of any fact or condition that makes untrue, or
shows to have been untrue, in any material respect, any material written
information provided by CBI to IBG, any confidential schedule to this
Agreement or any representation or warranty made by CBI in ARTICLE III or
that results in CBIs failure to comply with any covenant, condition or
agreement contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 5.08. _Litigation and Claims_. CBI shall promptly notify IBG in
writing of any litigation, or of any claim, controversy or contingent
liability that is reasonably expected to become the subject of litigation,
against CBI or any CBI Subsidiary or affecting any of their Properties, if
such litigation or potential litigation is reasonably likely, in the event of
an unfavorable outcome, to result in a Material Adverse Change to CBI or any
CBI Subsidiary. CBI shall promptly notify IBG of any legal action, suit or
proceeding or judicial, administrative or governmental investigation, pending
or, to the Best Knowledge of CBI, threatened against CBI or any CBI
Subsidiary that (i) questions or would reasonably be expected to question the
validity of this Agreement or the agreements contemplated hereby, or any
actions taken or to be taken by CBI or any CBI Subsidiary pursuant hereto or
(ii) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

 

Section 5.09. _Adverse Changes_. CBI shall promptly notify IBG in writing

of CBI, been threatened involving a prospective change) in the business,
financial condition or operations of CBI and/or any CBI Subsidiary that has
resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Change to CBI or any CBI Subsidiary.

 



45 Section 5.10. _No Negotiation with Others_.

 

A. CBI agrees that it shall not, and that it shall cause each CBI
Subsidiary and the respective employees, directors, officers, financial
advisors and agents of CBI and Northstar Bank (collectively, " _CBI
Representatives_ ") not to (i) solicit, knowingly encourage, initiate or
participate in any negotiations or discussions with any third party
(except for the limited purpose of notifying such person of the existence of
the provisions of this Section 5.10) regarding an Acquisition Proposal (as
defined below), whether by acquisition, business combination, purchase of
securities or assets or otherwise; (ii) disclose to any third party any
information concerning the business, Properties, books or records of CBI or
any CBI Subsidiary in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, other than as
provided herein or as compelled by law; or (iii) cooperate with any third
party to make any Acquisition Proposal, other than the sale by CBI or any CBI
Subsidiary of assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices. Promptly upon receipt of any unsolicited offer, CBI will
communicate to IBG the terms of any proposal or request for information and
the identity of the parties involved.

 

B. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.10,
if at any time after the date hereof and before the Closing, CBI and the CBI
Representatives, having each theretofore complied with the terms of Section
5.10(A), receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, CBI
and the CBI Representatives may engage in negotiations and discussions with,
and furnish any information and other access (so long as all such information
and access has previously been made available to IBG or is made available to
IBG before or concurrently with the time such information or access is made
available to such person) to, any person making such Acquisition Proposal if,
and only if, the CBI Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal and financial advisors, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal is or
is reasonably capable of becoming a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and
(ii) the failure of the CBI Board to furnish such information or access or
enter into such discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected to be
a violation of its fiduciary duties to the CBI shareholders; but before
furnishing any material nonpublic information, CBI shall have received from
the person making such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality
agreement with terms at least as restrictive in all material respects on such
person as the Mutual Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement entered into
with IBG on July 22, 2016, which confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit
CBI from complying with the terms of this Section 5.10. CBI will promptly,
and in any event within two business days, (x) notify IBG in writing of the
receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
relating to CBI or for access to the Properties, books or records of CBI
by any person that has made, or to the Best Knowledge of CBI may be
considering making, an Acquisition Proposal and (y) communicate the material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal to IBG, including as they may change upon
any modification or amendment to the terms thereof. CBI will keep IBG
reasonably apprised of the status of and other matters relating to any such
Acquisition Proposal on a timely basis.

 

C. Nothing contained in this Section 5.10 shall prevent CBI or the CBI
Board from (i) taking the actions provided in Sections 1.08(C) or 5.10(B),
(ii) responding to an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal for the sole
purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) informing any person who submits an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal of CBIs obligations pursuant to Section 5.10(A) or (iv) in
consultation with outside counsel, complying with its disclosure obligations
under federal or state law in connection with a Change in Recommendation.

 



46 D. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means a
written offer or proposal from a party other than IBG which contains a fixed
price per share or a mathematically ascertainable formula for calculating a
price per share for the CBI Share regarding any of the following (other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) involving CBI: (i) any
merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization,
business combination, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or equity securities or
deposits of, CBI, in a single transaction or series of related transactions
which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or
materially delay the completion of the Merger; or (ii) any tender offer or
exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding CBI Shares or the filing of
a registration statement in connection therewith.

 

E. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona
fide Acquisition Proposal made by a party other than IBG that the CBI Board
determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside
counsel and its independent financial advisor (i) is or would result in a
transaction that if consummated would be more favorable to CBIs shareholders
from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all of the
terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement (including any
proposal by IBG to amend the terms of this Agreement) and (ii) is capable of
being, and is reasonably likely to be, consummated on the terms so proposed
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
proposal.

 

Section 5.11. _Non-Governmental Consents and Approvals_. CBI shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals from
third parties listed on _Confidential Schedule 3.05_. CBI will cooperate in
all commercially reasonable respects with IBG to obtain all such approvals and
consents required of IBG.

 

Section 5.12. _Environmental Investigation; Right to Terminate Agreement_.

 

A. IBG and its consultants, agents and representatives, at the sole cost
and expense of IBG, shall have the right to the same extent that CBI has the
right, but not the obligation or responsibility, to inspect any Property,
including conducting asbestos surveys and sampling, environmental assessments
and investigation, and other environmental surveys and analyses including
soil and ground sampling (" _Environmental Inspections_ "). IBG shall notify
CBI in writing before any Environmental Inspection, and CBI may place
reasonable restrictions on the time of such Environmental Inspection. If, as
a result of any such Environmental Inspection, further investigation ("
_Secondary Investigation_ ") including, test borings, soil, water and other
sampling is deemed desirable by IBG, IBG shall (i) notify CBI in writing of
any Property for which it intends to conduct such a Secondary Investigation
and the reasons for the Secondary Investigation, and (ii) at the sole cost and
expense of IBG, commence the Secondary Investigation. IBG shall give
reasonable written notice to CBI of the Secondary Investigation, and CBI may
place reasonable time and place restrictions on the Secondary Investigation.

 



47 B. IBG shall make available to CBI the results and reports of
such Environmental Inspections and Secondary Investigations promptly after
IBG receives or is advised of such results. IBG shall not have any liability
or responsibility of any nature whatsoever for the results, conclusions or
other findings related to any Environmental Inspection, Secondary
Investigation or other environmental survey. If this Agreement is terminated,
except as otherwise required by law, reports to any Governmental Authority of
the results of any Environmental Inspection, Secondary Investigation or other
environmental survey shall not be made by IBG. IBG shall make no such report
before Closing unless required to do so by applicable law, and in such case
will give CBI reasonable written notice of IBGs intentions.

C. IBG shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by providing
written notice to CBI within ninety (90) days following the date of this
Agreement if, with respect to the Properties (as defined in Section 11.10)
only, (i) the factual substance of any warranty or representation set forth in
Section 3.22 is not materially true and accurate; (ii) the results of an
Environmental Inspection or Secondary Investigation are disapproved by IBG
because such Environmental Inspection or Secondary Investigation identifies
material violations or potential material violations of Environmental
Laws; (iii) CBI has refused to allow IBG to conduct an Environmental
Inspection or Secondary Investigation in a manner that IBG reasonably
considers necessary; (iv) the Environmental Inspection or Secondary
Investigation identifies any past or present event, condition or circumstance
that would or potentially could reasonably be expected to require a remedial
or cleanup action costing in excess of $250,000 or result in a Material
Adverse Change to CBI or any CBI Subsidiary; (v) the Environmental Inspection
or Secondary Investigation identifies the presence of any underground or above
ground storage tank in, on or under any Property that is not shown to be in
material compliance with all Environmental Laws applicable to the tank either
at the date of this Agreement or at a future time certain, or that has had a
release of petroleum or some other Hazardous Material that has not been
cleaned up to the satisfaction of the relevant Governmental Authority or any
other party with a legal right to compel cleanup; or (vi) the Environmental
Inspection or Secondary Investigation identifies the presence of any asbestos-
containing material in, on or under any Property, the removal of which could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. IBG shall
advise CBI in writing (the " _Environmental Notice_ ") as to whether IBG
intends to terminate this Agreement because IBG disapproves of the results of
the Environmental Inspection or Secondary Inspection in respect of the
Properties. Upon receipt of the Environmental Notice, CBI shall have the
opportunity to correct any objected to violations or conditions to IBGs
reasonable satisfaction within 30 days after the date of the Environmental
Notice. If CBI fails to demonstrate correction of the violations or conditions
to the reasonable satisfaction of IBG, IBG may terminate the Agreement on the
31st day after the date of the Environmental Notice.

 

D. CBI agrees to make available to IBG and its consultants, agents and
representatives all documents and other material relating to environmental
conditions of any Property including the results of other environmental
inspections and surveys. CBI also agrees that all engineers and consultants
who prepared or furnished such reports may discuss such reports
and information with IBG and shall be entitled to certify the same in favor
of IBG and its consultants, agents and representatives and make all other data
available to IBG and its consultants, agents and representatives.

 



48 Section 5.13. _Employee Plans and Employee Contracts_. Before the Closing
Date, CBI shall and shall cause each CBI Subsidiary to terminate the Employee
Plans subject to compliance with applicable law, so long as any such action
preserves the rights of the participants in such Employee Plans (including
vesting rights). Prior to Closing, CBI and each CBI Subsidiary shall accrue
for or make the payments required pursuant to the Employment Contracts as set
forth in _Confidential Schedule 3.20_ , and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from each applicable officer a release with respect to
their agreement (the " _Employment Contract Release_ ").

Section 5.14. _Confidential Schedules_. At least three business days
before the Closing, CBI agrees to provide IBG with supplemental _Confidential
Schedules_ to be delivered by CBI pursuant to this Agreement reflecting
any material changes thereto between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date. Any such supplemental _Confidential Schedules_ shall be deemed
to modify the representations and warranties of CBI for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty
of CBI in Article III hereof; provided, however, that such supplemental
_Confidential Schedules_ shall not modify the representations and warranties
of CBI for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of the
representations and warranties of CBI pursuant to Section 8.01 of this
Agreement.

Section 5.15. _Voting and Lock Up Agreement_. CBI shall execute and
deliver, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each person or
entity listed on _Confidential Schedule 5.15_ to execute and
deliver contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, a Voting and
Lock Up Agreement. CBI acknowledges that, upon the execution and delivery of
the Voting and Lock Up Agreements, such persons or entities shall have agreed
that they will vote the CBI Shares owned by them in favor of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, subject to
required regulatory approvals for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.16. _Releases_. CBI shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from each of the directors and executive officers of CBI
and each CBI Subsidiary listed on _Confidential Schedule 5.16_ a written
release in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "A" executed by such director
or executive officer and dated the Closing Date, releasing CBI and each CBI
Subsidiary from claims arising before the Effective Time (the " _Releases by D
andOs_").

Section 5.17. _Other Agreements_. CBI shall, and shall cause each CBI
Subsidiary to, execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement and such other
agreements, certificates of merger, certificates, and other documents
reasonably necessary to effect the Merger and the Bank Merger, and to take
all actions reasonably necessary or required to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

Section 5.18. _Support Agreement_. CBI shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each outside director of CBI and Northstar Bank to execute
and deliver to IBG, contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, a
Director Support Agreement providing for the continuing support of Independent
Bank by the outside directors (the " _Support Agreements_ ").

 



49 Section 5.19. _Shareholder Lists_. After the date of this Agreement, CBI
shall from time to time make available to IBG, upon its request, a list of the
CBI Shareholders, a list showing all transfers of the CBI Shares, a list
showing the grant and exercise of Options, and such other information as IBG
may reasonably request regarding both the ownership and prior transfers of
the CBI Shares and Options. Specifically, CBI shall deliver to IBG a certified
list of CBI Shareholders, in form and content reasonably satisfactory to the
Exchange Agent, at least ten days prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.20. _Conforming Accounting Adjustments_. CBI shall, if requested
in writing by IBG, consistent with GAAP, RAP and applicable banking laws and
regulations, immediately before Closing, make such accounting entries as CBI
may reasonably request in order to conform the accounting records of CBI to
the accounting policies and practices of IBG. No such adjustment by CBI or
any CBI Subsidiary shall of itself constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation or failure by CBI or any CBI Subsidiary to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of this
Agreement or constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement by IBG or be
an acknowledgment by CBI of any adverse circumstances for purposes of
determining whether the conditions to IBGs obligations under this Agreement
have been satisfied, nor will any such adjustment affect the calculation of
the Tangible Equity under Section 1.05. The recording of any such adjustments
shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished
financial statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence
by CBI, any CBI Subsidiary or their respective management with any such
adjustments.

 

Section 5.21. _D and O Liability Insurance_. Contemporaneously with the
Closing, CBI shall purchase an extended reporting period for four (4) years
under CBIs existing directors and officers liability insurance policy for
purposes of covering actions occurring prior to the Effective Time, on terms
approved by IBG. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
cost of the premiums for such coverage shall be paid by CBI and shall be
included (as a deduction) in the calculation of Tangible Equity.

 

Section 5.22. _Termination of DP Contracts and IT Conversion_. CBI will
use commercially reasonable efforts, including but not limited to notifying
appropriate parties and negotiation in good faith a reasonable settlement, to
ensure that the DP Contracts and contracts related to the provision of any
other electronic banking services, if the Merger occurs, be terminated after
the consummation of the Merger on a date to be mutually agreed upon by IBG and
CBI. Such notice and actions by CBI will be in accordance with the terms of
such contracts. CBI shall use reasonable efforts and cooperate with IBG
to facilitate a smooth conversion of data processing, item processing,

telecommunications, data communications and other technologies, including
participating in conversion planning, design, mapping and testing activities
before the Closing Date.

reasonable efforts to cause the executive officers identified in _Confidential
Schedule 5.23_ to execute and deliver to IBG, contemporaneously with the
execution of this Agreement, an employment agreement providing for
their continued employment with Independent Bank following the Merger.

 



50 Section 5.24. _Obligations Related to Trust Preferred Securities_. CBI
will reasonably cooperate with IBG to permit IBG, upon completion of the
Merger to assume expressly the obligations of CBI under the Indentures; but in
no event will CBI or its counsel be required to deliver opinions or
certificates except as the trustees of the Trusts may reasonably require with
respect to the establishment and status of the Trust and CBIs performance of
its obligations before, and not in connection with, the assumption of the
obligations by IBG.

 

Section 5.25. _Transaction Litigation_. CBI shall give IBG the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against CBI and/or its directors relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the prior written consent of IBG, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this
paragraph, "participate" means that the non-litigating party will be kept
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to
the litigation by the litigating party, consistent with the common interest of
CBI and IBG in these matters and the applicable privileges and protections
provided therein, and the non-litigating party may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to the litigation, but will not be afforded any
decision making power or other authority over the litigation, except for the
settlement consent set forth above.

 

Section 5.26. _Separation Agreements_. CIB shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the executive officers of CBI identified in
_Schedule 5.26_ to execute and deliver contemporaneously with the execution of
this Agreement, a Separation Agreement providing for the separation of their
employment with CBI effective as of the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.27. _No Excess Parachute Payments_. CBI and each CBI Subsidiary
shall not make any payment or provide any benefit to any officer, director or
employee of CBI, any CBI Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates who
is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
§ 1.280 G-1) under any employment, severance, or termination agreement, other
compensation arrangement or benefit plan currently in effect if such payment
or benefit would be an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
Code § 280G (b)(1)) solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or if such payment or benefit would result in the excise tax of
Code § 4999 being imposed on any such person.

Section 6.09. _Employee Matters_. On the Closing Date, IBG may, but shall
not be required to, cause Independent Bank to offer employment to the
employees of Northstar Bank. Each of the employees of Northstar Bank who
become an employee of Independent Bank after the Effective Time shall be
entitled to receive, from and after the Effective Time, the same pension,
profit sharing, health, welfare, incentive, vacation and other benefits as are
customarily offered or afforded to similarly situated employees

this Agreement, provide CBI with a list of employees of Northstar Bank to whom

 



53  Independent Bank will not offer employment and a list of employees of

prior to the Closing, IBG agrees to provide CBI with supplemental
_Confidential Schedules_ to be delivered by IBG pursuant to this Agreement
reflecting any material changes thereto between the date of this Agreement

of IBG in Article IV hereof; provided, however, that such supplemental
_Confidential Schedules_ shall not modify the representations and warranties

by Section 5.15, will be freely tradable by each CBI shareholder who is not a
dealer for purposes of the Securities Act.

Section 6.13. _Access to Properties and Records_. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, IBG shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, upon
reasonable notice from CBI to IBG to: (a) afford the employees and officers
and authorized representatives (including legal counsel, accountants
and consultants) of CBI reasonable access to the properties, books and
records of IBG and its Subsidiaries during normal business hours in order that
CBI may have the opportunity to make such reasonable investigation as it shall
desire to make of the affairs of IBG and its Subsidiaries, and (b) furnish
CBI with such additional financial and operating data and other information as
to the business and properties of IBG as CBI may, from time to time,
reasonably request. No investigation by CBI or its representatives shall
affect the representations and warranties set forth herein; provided, however,
that CBI shall promptly notify IBG to the extent that CBIs investigation
determines that any of the representations and warranties by IBG set forth in
ARTICLE IV are untrue.

 



54 Section 6.14. _Rule 144 Compliance_. For a period of two years after the
Effective Time (or such shorter period of time as may be applicable for
"affiliates" of CBI to sell IBG Shares in accordance with Rule 145 of the
Securities Act), IBG will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file in a
timely manner all reports with the SEC required to be filed by it pursuant to

out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, matters related to the negotiation, execution
and performance of this Agreement or consummation of the Merger) to the same
extent (including advancement of expenses) and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Certificate of Formation, as applicable, of CBI or such CBI
Subsidiary, or in the Bylaws of CBI or any CBI Subsidiary, as in effect on
the date hereof. If IBG or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of IBG or
the surviving company shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.15 prior to or simultaneously with the consummation of such transaction.

Section 6.16. _Election of Directors_. At the IBG Meeting, IBG shall
include a proposal to elect at least three individuals who are directors of
CBI mutually determined by IBG and CBI (the " _CBI Nominees_ ") to the Board
of Directors of IBG; provided, however, that if the number of CBI Nominees to
be nominated for election does not constitute at least 25% of the total number
of IBG directors following the election of the CBI Nominees, then the number
of CBI Nominees to be nominated shall be increased such that the total number
of CBI Nominees will constitute not less than 25% of the total number of IBG
directors following election of the CBI Nominees. The initial CBI Nominees
shall be those individuals identified on _Confidential Schedule 6.16._
IBG shall specifically nominate one CBI Nominee to be elected as a Class I
director whose term ends in 2017 (the " _Class I CBI Nominee_ "), one CBI
Nominee to be elected as a Class II director whose term ends in 2018, and one
CBI Nominee to be elected as a Class III director whose term ends in 2019.
IBG shall include the Class I CBI Nominee in IBGs proxy statement, and
recommend that the IBG shareholders elect, the Class I CBI Nominee to the
board of directors of IBG at the 2017 annual meeting of IBG shareholders. If
the number of CBI Nominees will exceed three individuals, such additional CBI
Nominees shall be allocated as evenly as possible among the classes of the IBG
Board of Directors, beginning with the class that has the longest remaining
term as of the Closing Date. IBG shall cause Independent Bank to elect all of
the CBI Nominees to the Independent Bank Board of Directors. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, IBGs obligation to nominate and recommend, as the case may
be, a CBI Nominee is subject to such CBI Nominees compliance with IBGs or
Independent Banks, as the case may be, governance and ethics policies in
place from time to time, and that at least two of such CBI Nominees qualify
as an "independent" director as defined by applicable NASDAQ rules.

each other at the Closing constitute the full understanding of the parties, a
complete allocation of risks between them and a complete and exclusive

written or oral, that may exist between the parties with respect thereto.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, no conditions,

purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of

unenforceable provision were not a part hereof, and all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement
a provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision as may be possible and still be legal, valid and enforceable. If any
provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision
shall be interpreted to be only as broad as is enforceable.

Agreement to an Article, Section, Exhibit or _Confidential Schedule_ , such
reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit or _Confidential
Schedule_ to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular provision in this Agreement. Each use
herein of the masculine, neuter or feminine gender shall be deemed to include
the other genders. Each use herein of the plural shall include the

otherwise appropriate. The word "or" is used in the inclusive sense. Any

instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and
(in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and

References to a person are also to its permitted successors or assigns.

 

Section 11.14. _Binding Effect; Assignment_. All of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding
upon, and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto
and their respective heirs, successors, representatives and permitted assigns.
Nothing expressed or referred to herein is intended or shall be construed to
give any person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement, or any provision herein
contained, it being the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement,
the assumption of obligations and statements of responsibilities hereunder,
and all other conditions and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and for the benefit of no other person. Nothing
in this Agreement shall act to relieve or discharge the obligation or
liability of any third party to any party to this Agreement, nor shall any
provision give any third party any right of subrogation or action over or
against any party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, it is specifically intended by the parties to this Agreement
that the persons entitled to the benefits of the covenants contained in
Section 6.15 and Section 6.16 are third-party beneficiaries solely with
respect to such sections. No party to this Agreement shall assign this
Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, without the
prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment made or attempted in
violation of this Section 11.14 shall be void and of no effect.

Section 11.15. _Public Disclosure_. None of IBG, Independent Bank, CBI or
any CBI Subsidiary will make, issue or release, or cause to be made, issued or
released, any announcement, statement, press release, acknowledgment or other
public disclosure of the existence, terms, conditions or status of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of the other parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
IBG and CBI, upon prior notice to the other party, will be permitted to
make (i) disclosure to their own officers, directors, employees and
shareholders, and (ii) any public disclosures or governmental filings as legal
counsel may deem necessary to maintain compliance with or to prevent
violations of applicable federal or state laws or regulations or that may be
necessary to obtain regulatory approval for the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



70 Section 11.16. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Closing Date,
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards
of directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto or
(iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party in the manner provided in Section 11.17, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. No party to this
Agreement shall by any act (except by a written instrument given pursuant to
Section 11.17) be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to
have acquiesced in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No
failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder by any party hereto shall operate as a waiver thereof. No
single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. A waiver of any party of any right or remedy on
any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that
such party would otherwise have on any future occasion or to any right or
remedy that any other party may have hereunder.

 

Section 11.17. _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of
directors, at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the CBI
shareholders; but after the approval of this Agreement by the CBI
shareholders, there shall not be, without the further approval of the
CBI shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that decreases the
consideration to be paid for the CBI Shares pursuant to Section 1.05 that
materially and adversely affects the rights of the CBI shareholders hereunder.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto.
