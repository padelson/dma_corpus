Section 2.11(b)) or the holder of any Company Option, each Company Option that
was outstanding and vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including each Company Option that vests as a result of the Merger (each, a
"Company Vested Option"), whether pursuant to the terms of a Company Plan or
as determined by the Company Board prior to the Closing, shall be
automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive (A) subject to
compliance with the terms of Section 2.11(b), an amount in cash payable in
respect of each such Company Vested Option pursuant to Section 2.13(a)(vi)
equal to (1) Company Common Stock Per Share 

Closing Consideration minus (2) the exercise price per share of such Company
Vested Option (such amount in this clause (A), the "Company Vested Option Per
Share Closing Consideration"), multiplied by (3) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock into which such Company Vested Option is exercisable as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time; (B) a contingent right to receive,
when and if required to be paid, an additional amount of cash, if any,
required to be distributed in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of Section 2.16(c), Article VIII and the Escrow Agreement
consisting of the Company Vested Option Per Share Escrow Consideration; and
(C) a contingent right to receive an Earn‑Out Payment, if any, in accordance

or the Earn-Out Agreement to the Company Vested Optionholders shall be treated
as compensation for Tax purposes.



(ii) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any
Company Option, all Company Options, other than Company Vested Options, that
are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled, extinguished and terminated.



(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, after the Effective Time, no Company Option
shall be exercisable by the holder thereof for, or otherwise entitle the
holder thereof to receive, shares of Company Common Stock (or any other equity
security or other consideration), but shall only entitle such holder to the
payment (if any) described in this Section 2.11(a).



(b) No later than ten Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver to each holder of a Company Vested Option a letter, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Securityholder
Representative, describing the treatment of and payment for such Company
Vested Option pursuant to this Section 2.11 and providing instructions for use
in obtaining payment therefor, which instructions will require each holder
thereof, as a condition to receiving any payment pursuant to this Agreement in
respect of such Company Vested Option, to enter into an agreement on terms and
conditions substantially similar to the Letter of Transmittal, including
provisions to the effect that (i) each such holder shall, upon execution of
such agreement, be deemed to have appointed the Securityholder Representative
as its representative and (ii) the terms of Article VIII shall be deemed to
bind such holder as if it were a signatory hereto.



Section 2.12 Dissenting Shares.



(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any holder who is
entitled to demand and who demands properly in writing appraisal for such
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock in accordance with,
and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (any such
shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights under the
DGCL with respect to such shares), shall not be converted into, or represent
the right to receive, 

the consideration payable in respect of such shares in accordance with Section
2.8(a) and Section 2.9(a), as applicable, but instead such holder of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to receive payment of the appraised
value of such shares of Company Stock in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
otherwise lost its rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under Section
262 of the DGCL or (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have
determined that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, then such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have
been automatically converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, and
shall represent only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect
of such shares in accordance with Section 2.8(a) and Section 2.9(a), as
applicable, without any interest thereon, upon surrender in the manner
provided in Section 2.13, and the right of such holder to payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease.



(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
similar instruments or notices served upon the Company pursuant to the DGCL
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or settle or make any settlement offer with respect to any such
demands.



Section 2.13 Payments at Closing and Exchange Procedures Generally.



(a) Payments at Closing. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent, the Company and the Securityholder Representative shall
appoint the Escrow Agent to act as paying agent for the payment of the Closing
Merger Consideration payable in accordance with Sections 2.8, 2.9 and 2.11
and, if applicable, distributions of the Escrow Funds pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement and in accordance with this Article II and payment of any Earn‑Out
Payments pursuant to the Earn-Out Agreement. Not less than two Business Days
prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent and the Escrow Agent the
Closing Statement and a spreadsheet setting forth the calculation of the
payments to be made to each individual Company Securityholder pursuant to this
Section 2.13(a). On the Closing Date, promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit the Purchase Price into an account with the Escrow Agent
(the "Payment Fund") for the benefit of the Company Securityholders (other
than holders of Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 2.8(b) and Section 2.9(b), as applicable) that are entitled to receive
a portion of the Closing Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.13.
From such proceeds, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Escrow Agent to:



(i) first, repay the Closing Date Indebtedness (as set forth in the Closing
Statement) on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries in full pursuant to
the Payoff Letters; 



(ii) second, pay the Acquisition Expenses (as set forth in the Closing
Statement) on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company
Securityholders in full;



(iii) third, pay the Securityholder Representative Fee;



(iv) fourth, pay the Company Common Securityholder Representative Fee;



(v) fifth, deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section
2.14; and



(vi) sixth, distribute the Closing Merger Consideration payable to the Company
Securityholders in accordance with 2.8, 2.9 and 2.11.



(b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Parent
and the Company shall, or shall instruct the Escrow Agent to, deliver to each
Company Stockholder a notice advising each such Company Stockholder of the
anticipated Effective Time and the procedure for surrendering to the Escrow
Agent any certificates representing Company Stock (the "Certificates"), in
each case together with a letter of transmittal in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit I (each, a "Letter of Transmittal"). The Letter of
Transmittal shall specify, among other things, that (i) delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Escrow Agent and (ii) each Company
Stockholder shall, upon execution of such Letter of Transmittal, be deemed to
have appointed the Securityholder Representative as its representative and the
terms of Article VIII shall be deemed to bind such Company Stockholder as if
it were a signatory hereto. Each Company Stockholder shall be asked to deliver
an executed Letter of Transmittal, together with its Certificates, to the
Escrow Agent no less than two Business Days prior to Closing, to be held in
escrow by the Escrow Agent until the Closing. If such Company Stockholder has
complied with the foregoing, then such Company Stockholder shall be paid on
the Closing Date or the applicable date in respect of the release of Escrow
Funds or distribution of an Earn‑Out Payment pursuant to the Earn-Out
Agreement, as applicable, the amount, without interest, that such Company
Stockholder is entitled to receive in respect of the shares of Company Stock
evidenced by such Certificates pursuant to Section 2.8(a), Section 2.9(a),
this Section 2.13 and the Earn‑Out Agreement (as and when due hereunder or
thereunder) and the Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be canceled.
If a Company Stockholder has not delivered an executed Letter of Transmittal,
together with its Certificates, at least two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, or the applicable date in respect of the release of Escrow Funds
or distribution of an Earn‑Out Payment pursuant to the Earn‑Out Agreement, as
applicable, then such Company Stockholder shall be paid promptly after the
Escrow Agent receives such documents, the amount, without interest, that such
Company Stockholder in entitled to receive in respect of the shares of Company
Stock evidenced by such Certificates pursuant to Section 2.8(a), Section
2.9(a), this Section 2.13 and the Earn‑Out Agreement (as and when due
hereunder or thereunder), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
immediately be canceled. Until so surrendered, any outstanding Certificates
held by a Company Stockholder shall be deemed from and after the Effective
Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the
amounts specified by Section 2.8(a), Section 2.9(a), this Section 2.13 and the
Earn‑Out Agreement (as and when due 

hereunder or thereunder) and payable in respect of the shares of Company Stock
evidenced by such Certificates in accordance with such provisions.



(c) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Escrow Agent shall, on behalf
of Parent, pay, from amounts deposited by Parent with the Escrow Agent, the
amounts specified by Section 2.8(a), Section 2.9(a), this Section 2.13 and the
Earn‑Out Agreement (as and when due hereunder or thereunder) in respect of the
shares of Company Stock evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof; provided, that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to payment, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to provide an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent as indemnification against any claim that
may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent with
respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



(d) Transfers of Ownership. If the payment of the consideration payable in
respect of shares of Company Stock in accordance with Section 2.8(a), Section
2.9(a), this Section 2.13 and the Earn‑Out Agreement (as and when due
hereunder or thereunder), as applicable, is to be paid to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are
registered, then it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Certificates
so surrendered are properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment has (A) paid to Parent
or the Escrow Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of such consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Certificates surrendered, or (B) established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent or the Escrow Agent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable.



(e) Withholding for Payment of Taxes.



(i) Parent the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Earn-Out Agreement, such amounts as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent is required to deduct
and withhold under any applicable Tax Law. Before making any such deduction or
withholding (other than any deduction or withholding with respect to payments
described in Section 2.11 or the Company's failure to deliver the FIRPTA
Certificate in accordance with Section 6.8), Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Escrow Agent shall provide any party on behalf of which such deduction
or withholding is proposed to be made with twenty (20) days' advance written
notice of the intention to make such deduction or withholding, which notice
shall include the authority, basis and method of calculation for the proposed
deduction or withholding, and Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow
Agent will cooperate with any reasonable request from such party to obtain
reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow
Agent and paid to the proper Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable
Tax Law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Earn‑Out Agreement as having been paid
to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent. 



(ii) Prior to and after the Closing, each Company Securityholder shall provide
Parent and the Securityholder Representative with any forms (including IRS
Forms W-8 and W-9) that are requested by Parent or the Securityholder
Representative for purposes of complying with any applicable Tax Law.



(iii) In the event that any additional Taxes are imposed on Parent or the
Surviving Corporation as a result of any failure to withhold any income,
excise, payroll, social security or other employment Taxes from (i) payments
made under this Agreement to any Company Securityholder or (ii) as a result of
the exercise of any Company Options or any election under Section 83(b) of the
Code with respect to any Company Stock prior to the Closing, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation may set off or withhold such additional Taxes from any
amounts such Company Securityholder is otherwise entitled to from the Escrow
Funds.



(iv) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, other than as described in
Section 2.11 above or pursuant to a final determination within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or similar state or local Law), all payments made
to Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or the Earn-Out Agreement shall be
characterized for federal, state and local income tax purposes, as
consideration payable in exchange for the Company Securities held by such
Sellers in a capital transaction (other than any amounts treated as interest
under Section 483 of the Code). Any withholding or reporting required by
applicable Tax Law shall be undertaken in a manner consistent with the
requirements of this Section 2.13(e)(iv).



(f) Adjustments. If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company Stock, or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Stock, shall occur by reason of any reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares of Company Stock, then the consideration payable in
respect of such shares and other Company Securities in accordance with Article
II hereof shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.



(g) Termination of Payment Fund; No Liability. Subject to the second sentence
of this Section 2.13(g), any portion of the Payment Fund that constitutes the
Closing Merger Consideration or any Earn‑Out Payment and that remains
undistributed to the Company Securityholders (A) in the case of the Closing
Merger Consideration, as of the twelve‑month anniversary of the Effective Time
and (B) in the case of any Earn‑Out Payment, as of the twelve‑month
anniversary of the applicable date in respect of the distribution of such
Earn‑Out Payment pursuant to the Earn‑Out Agreement, shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any Company Securityholder (other than a holder of
Dissenting Shares and shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.8(b)
and Section 2.9(b), as applicable), who has not complied with this Section
2.13 shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to any consideration that may be payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Escrow Agent shall be liable
to any Company Securityholder for any consideration delivered to a public
official in accordance with any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Law. 



(h) No Further Ownership Rights. Payment of the consideration pursuant to 2.8,
2.9 and 2.11 and the Earn‑Out Agreement (in each case, as applicable) shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Company Securities and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the records of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Securities which were
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section
2.13.



Section 2.14 Escrow.



(a) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Securityholder Representative and Parent shall enter into the Escrow Agreement
with the Escrow Agent. Immediately following its receipt of the Purchase
Price, the repayment of the outstanding Closing Date Indebtedness and the
payment of the Acquisition Expenses outstanding as of the Closing Date, the
Securityholder Representative Fee and the Company Common Securityholder
Representative Fee, in each case, pursuant to Section 2.13(a), the Escrow
Agent shall deposit the Escrow Amount in the Escrow Account, to be held by the
Escrow Agent for the purpose of securing the obligations of the Company
Securityholders set forth in Article VIII and Section 2.16 (the "Escrow
Account"). The Escrowed Proceeds shall be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrowed Proceeds shall be held and
disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.



(b) Except as otherwise provided in the Escrow Agreement, on the date that is
the 12‑month anniversary of the Closing Date, the General Escrow
Indemnification Amount Proceeds, minus the aggregate amount of Damages claimed
by the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.1(a) (and not fully
resolved prior to such date), shall be released to the Escrow Agent for
disbursement to the Company Securityholders in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.



(c) The Litigation Escrow Indemnification Amount Proceeds shall be released in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth on Section 2.14(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.



(d) The parties hereto agree that, for Tax reporting purposes, Parent shall be
deemed to be the owner of the Escrowed Proceeds, as reduced from time to time
by the amounts distributed from the Escrow Account in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and that all interest on or other taxable
income, if any, earned from the investment of the Escrowed Proceeds pursuant
to this Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes as earned by Parent until
the Escrowed Proceeds are distributed in accordance with this Agreement. Any
and all distributions from the Escrow Account to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be characterized for federal, state and
local income tax purposes, as consideration payable in exchange for the
Company Stock held by such Company Stockholders eligible for installment sale
treatment pursuant to Section 453 of the Code (other than any amounts treated
as interest under Section 483 of the Code). 



Section 2.15 Earn‑Out Payments. Concurrently with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Parent, the Company Common Securityholders and the Company
Common Securityholder Representative shall enter into the Earn‑Out Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Earn‑Out
Agreement, following the Closing, Parent shall make certain contingent
payments to some or all of the Company Common Securityholders as set forth in

Section 2.16 Adjustment.



(a) No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
deliver to the Securityholder Representative a written statement setting forth
Parent's determination, calculated as of the Closing Date, of the amounts of
Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and Acquisition Expenses, in
each case together with a reasonable itemization and reasonable supporting
detail (such statement, the "Statement").



(b) Disputes; Final Statement.



(i) The Securityholder Representative shall have (A) the opportunity to
examine the work papers, schedules and other documents prepared by Parent in
connection with its preparation of the Statement, and (B) the reasonable
assistance and cooperation of the appropriate personnel and agents of Parent
and access to other books and records of Parent relating to the preparation of
the Statement; provided, that such access shall in each case be upon
reasonable prior notice and in a manner that does not materially interfere
with the normal business operations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.
The Securityholder Representative may dispute any amounts reflected on the
Statement, but only on the basis that the amounts reflected on the Statement
were not arrived at in accordance with this Agreement or were arrived at based
on mathematical or clerical error; provided, however, that the Securityholder
Representative shall have notified Parent in writing of each disputed item,
setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, the dollar
amounts involved and the Securityholder Representative's calculation of the
amounts set forth in the Statement (such notice, a "Statement Dispute
Notice"), within twenty (20) Business Days of Parent's delivery of the
Statement to the Securityholder Representative.



(ii) If the Securityholder Representative does not, within twenty (20)
Business Days of receiving the Statement, either (A) deliver a Statement
Dispute Notice to Parent or (B) deliver a written notice to Parent stating
that the Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive, the Statement shall
be deemed to be the "Final Statement" for purposes of calculating the
Adjustment. In the event of a dispute as set forth in a Statement Dispute
Notice, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall attempt to
reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive. If Parent and the
Securityholder Representative are unable to reach a resolution with such
effect within twenty (20) Business Days after the receipt by Parent of a
Statement Dispute Notice, then Parent and the Securityholder Representative
shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to Ernst and Young
(or, if such firm shall decline or is unable to act or is not, at the time of
such submission, independent of Parent and the Securityholder Representative,
to another independent accounting firm of international reputation mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Securityholder Representative) (in either event,
such accounting firm being referred to herein as 

the "Accounting Firm"), which shall, within thirty (30) days after such
submission, determine and report to Parent and the Securityholder
Representative upon such remaining disputed items. Such determination by the
Accounting Firm shall be (1) in writing, (2) based solely on written
submissions by Parent and the Securityholder Representative relating to the
items remaining in dispute and not by independent review of any other matter,
(3) made in a manner that is consistent with the prescribed manner of
preparation of the Statement pursuant to Section 2.16(a), and (4) limited
solely to a selection of the position held by Parent or the Securityholder
Representative. Such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be final,
binding and conclusive and the Statement shall be deemed to be the "Final
Statement" for purposes of calculating the Adjustment. The fees and
disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by (x) the Company
Securityholders in the event that the Accounting Firm selects the position
held by Parent, or (y) by Parent in the event that the Accounting Firm selects
the position held by the Securityholder Representative. In acting under this
Agreement, the Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the privileges and
immunities of arbitrators.



(c) Once the Statement is deemed to be the Final Statement pursuant to Section
2.16(b), the amount of the Adjustment shall be calculated. If the Adjustment
is a positive amount, then not later than three (3) Business Days after the
date on which the Statement is deemed to be the Final Statement, Parent shall
pay to the Escrow Agent the amount equal to the Adjustment and the Escrow
Agent will distribute to each Company Securityholder such Company
Securityholder's Aggregate Pro Rata Portion of the Adjustment, net of
applicable withholding Taxes, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
If the Adjustment is a negative amount, then Parent shall be paid an amount
equal to the absolute value of the Adjustment out of the funds comprising the
General Escrow Indemnification Amount by wire transfer of immediately
available funds; provided, however, that, in the event that the Adjustment
amount to be paid to Parent pursuant to this Section 2.16(c) exceeds $250,000,
Parent may, in its sole discretion, seek payment of such Adjustment amount in
excess of $250,000 directly from the Company Securityholders, in accordance
with each Company Securityholder's Pro Rata Indemnity Portion thereof.



(d) In the event that, subsequent to the Statement being deemed to be the
Final Statement pursuant to Section 2.16(b), any Parent Indemnified Party
desires to dispute the amount of Acquisition Expenses and/or Closing Date
Indebtedness set forth on the Final Statement pursuant to Section 8.1 below,
such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in
paragraphs (b) and (c) above, applied mutatis mutandis. If the Accounting Firm
determines that the amount(s) of the Acquisition Expenses and/or Closing Date
Indebtedness should be adjusted (on an aggregate net basis and without
duplication) in favor of Parent, then Parent shall be paid an amount equal to
the value of such adjustment out of the funds comprising the General Escrow
Indemnification Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds;
provided, however, that, in the event that (i) the amount to be paid to Parent
pursuant to this Section 2.16(d) plus the Adjustment amount to be paid to
Parent pursuant to Section 2.16(c) exceeds $250,000 or (ii) the funds
comprising the General Escrow Indemnification Amount are insufficient to pay
such adjustment amount, Parent may, in its sole discretion, seek payment of
such adjustment amount directly from the Company Securityholders, in
accordance with each Company Securityholder's Pro Rata Indemnity Portion
thereof.

Organizational Documents or the Subsidiaries' Organizational Documents in
effect on the date hereof. The Surviving Corporation shall ensure that the
provisions in the Certificate of 

Incorporation and By‑laws of the Surviving Corporation allowing for the
indemnification of the Company Indemnified Parties and the provision of
insurance for the Company Indemnified Parties shall not be amended in a manner
that would limit the scope of such indemnification and insurance.



(b) The Surviving Corporation shall purchase a "tail" insurance policy
comparable to the Company's and its Subsidiaries' current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for the Company
Indemnified Parties that shall provide such Company Indemnified Parties with
coverage for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, with
reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
claims arising from or related to facts or events that occurred at or before
the Effective Time; provided, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend an annual amount in excess of 125% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance coverage.



(c) The provisions of this Section 6.3 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and each party
entitled to insurance coverage under this Section 6.3, respectively, and his
or her heirs and legal representatives.



(d) If the Surviving Corporation (or any of its successors or assigns) (i)
consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, then Parent shall cause proper provisions to be made
such that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.3.



Section 6.4 Employee Matters.



(a) Parent shall give individuals who are employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Employees"), full
credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under the
employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries in which such Employees participate following the Closing Date
for such Employees' service with the Company, and prior service with Parent or
its Affiliates (as and to the same extent such prior service was recognized by
the Company), to the same extent recognized by comparable Company Plans
immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that no such credit will
result in a duplication of benefits or require any retroactive contributions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any welfare benefit plans
maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries for the benefit of Employees on and
after the Closing Date, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or preexisting
condition limitations to the same extent waived under comparable plans of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible and maximum out‑of‑pocket limitations, to amounts
paid by such Employees in the year of the Closing Date with respect to similar
plans maintained by the Company. 



(b) Except as otherwise provided in the Offer Letters or any other agreement
entered into by the Surviving Corporation or Parent with an employee, for the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending December 31, 2015, Parent
shall provide (or cause the Surviving Corporation or another Affiliate of
Parent to provide) the Employees with (i) salary or wage level, (ii) non-
equity-based incentive compensation opportunities, and (iii) non‑equity‑based
employee benefits, including, without limitation, matching contributions under
the Company's 529 plan (the compensation and benefits described in the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) being collectively referred to as
"Employee Benefits"), in each case which are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the Employee Benefits provided to the Employees by the Company or
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date. For the 2016 calendar
year, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or other Affiliate of
Parent) to provide Employee Benefits to the Employees that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those compensation opportunities and employee
benefits generally provided by the Parent to its similarly situated employees.



(c) Nothing in this Section 6.4, whether express or implied, shall in any way
(i) constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any Company Plan or any
other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or
Parent, (ii) prevent the amendment or termination of any Company Plan or
interfere with the right or obligation of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law, (iii)
otherwise operate to require Parent to duplicate any payments or benefits
payable pursuant to any Company Plan or other compensation or benefits plans,
policies, programs, agreements or other arrangements of the Surviving
Corporation, (iv) provide or confer upon any Person any third‑party
beneficiary rights, including any right to employment or continued employment
for any specified period or continued participation in any benefit plan, by
reason of this Section 6.4, or (v) limit Parent's or the Surviving
Corporation's or any of their respective Subsidiaries' rights to terminate any
Employee for any reason at any time.



(d) The Parent and the Company hereby approve and agree that the Dun and
Bradstreet Credibility Corp. 401(k) Plan of the Company shall be merged with
and into the Dun and Bradstreet 401(k) Plan of Parent on or as soon as
practicable (in the reasonable discretion of Parent) following the Effective
Time.



Section 6.5 Company Stockholder Approvals. Promptly following the execution of
this Agreement, but in any event no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on
the date of this Agreement, the Company shall obtain the Company Stockholder
Approvals and deliver a copy thereof to Parent. Promptly following its
delivery of the Company Stockholder Approvals to Parent, the Company shall
deliver to the Company Stockholders that did not execute the Stockholder
Written Consent (i) a copy of such Stockholder Written Consent, and (ii) the
notice(s) required pursuant to Section 228 and 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, the
Company Organizational Documents or the Company Funding Documents. Any such
notice will comply with the requirements of applicable Law.



Section 6.6 Payoff Letters; Release of Liens. Contemporaneously with the
repayment of the Closing Date Indebtedness pursuant to Section 2.13(a)(i), the
Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent a payoff letter
executed by each lender of Closing Date Indebtedness (or, if applicable, the
administrative or other agent in respect of any applicable 

credit facility), effective as of the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Payoff Letters"), which shall provide for, among other things, the release,
discharge, removal and termination of all Liens on the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries arising under any applicable credit facility and related
agreements upon payment of the amounts set forth therein.



Section 6.7 Preservation of Books and Records. Parent shall, at its own
expense, preserve and keep, and cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to preserve and keep, in accordance with the then-current written
retention policies of Parent, books and records held by the Company or its
Subsidiaries relating to the Company Securityholders that are required to be
retained under such retention policies, during which time Parent shall make
such books and records available to the Securityholder Representative as the
Securityholder Representative may reasonably require in order to facilitate
the resolution of any claims made against or incurred by any Company
Securityholders relating to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
conducted prior to Closing. Parent may destroy such books and records after
such time, but only after Parent gives 30 days prior written notice to the
Securityholder Representative and details the contents of such books and
records to be destroyed. The Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Company Securityholders) shall have the option to take possession of such
books and records at its own expense within 30 days of the date of such notice
by Parent.



Section 6.8 FIRPTA Certificate. On or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a properly executed statement and corresponding notice
to the IRS, in a form acceptable to the Parent (the "FIRPTA Certificate"), for
purposes of satisfying the Parent's obligations under Sections 1.897‑2(h) and
1.1445‑2(c)(3) of the Treasury Regulations.



Section 6.9 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each party to this Agreement agrees to execute such documents and
use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all action
and to perform or cause to be performed all things and acts reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to carry out the provisions of this Agreement
and to consummate the Transactions, including contesting any Action relating
to the Transactions. No document executed pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall
be deemed to expand or limit the rights and obligations of the parties hereto
beyond those provided in this Agreement or provide for any additional rights
or obligations of the parties hereto that are not provided for in this
Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of any such
documents and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.



Section 6.10 [Reserved].



Section 6.11 Confidentiality. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are
hereby incorporated herein by reference and each party hereto agrees such
terms shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall
apply to all information made available by any party to the other parties
hereto pursuant to Section 5.2 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement. The
confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate as
of the Closing. Following the Closing, the Securityholder Representative and
each Seller agrees to, and shall cause its Representatives and Affiliates to,
(a) treat and hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide access to any
Person) all information relating to trade secrets, processes, patent
applications, product development, price, customer and supplier lists, pricing
and 

marketing plans, policies and strategies, details of client and consultant
contracts, operations methods, product development techniques, business
acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans and all other confidential
or proprietary information with respect to the Business or the Company, (b) in
the event that the Securityholder Representative or any Seller (or any of
their Representatives or Affiliates) becomes legally compelled to disclose any
such information, provide Parent with prompt written notice of such
requirement (to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law) so that Parent or
the Surviving Corporation may seek a protective Order or other remedy or waive
compliance with this Section 6.11, (c) in the event that such protective Order
or other remedy is not obtained, or Parent waives compliance with this Section
6.11, furnish only that portion of such confidential information which is
legally required to be provided and exercise its reasonable commercial efforts
to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information, and (d) promptly furnish (prior to, at, or as soon as practicable
following, the Closing) to Parent and the Surviving Corporation any and all
copies (in whatever form or medium) of all such confidential information then
in the possession of the Securityholder Representative or any Seller (or any
of their Representatives or Affiliates) and destroy any and all additional
copies then in the possession of the Securityholder Representative or the
Sellers (or any of their Representatives or Affiliates) of such information
and of any analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared, in
whole or in part, on the basis thereof; provided, however, that this sentence
shall not apply to any information that, at the time of disclosure, is
available publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this Agreement by the
Securityholder Representative or the Sellers (or their respective
Representatives or Affiliates).



Section 6.12 [Reserved].



Section 6.13 Agreement to Defend; Shareholder Litigation; Waiver and Release.



(a) In the event any Action by any Governmental Authority or other person is
commenced that questions the validity or legality of the Merger or this
Agreement or seeks damages, an injunction or other similar restraint in
connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond thereto.



(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the parties hereto shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do or cause to be done
all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to defend Parent, the
Company and DBCC in connection with the Class Action Litigation, including:
(i) producing any relevant books, records and documentation (subject to
applicable Law); (ii) making all applicable filings and motions; and (iii)
producing all witnesses controlled or employed by, or affiliated with, such
party, in each case, in furtherance of such defense.



(c) Parent and Company hereby agree to amend the first sentence of Section 1
of the Standstill Agreement to read as follows: "This Agreement shall be in
effect from February 20, 2014 (the "Effective Date") until thirty (30) days
after the earlier of (i) the Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and
(ii) the termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April
27, 2015 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Dun and Bradstreet, Inc., a

solely in respect of matters related to the Earn-Out Agreement." Promptly
following the Closing, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Securityholder Representative shall take such actions as are necessary to
promptly cause the DBCC Lawsuit to be dismissed with prejudice.



(d) As an inducement and condition to the parties' willingness to enter into
this Agreement, effective as of the Effective Time, each of Parent, on behalf
of itself and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Company, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, on the other
hand, and its and their respective past and current employees, officers,
directors, representatives, agents, administrators, executors, divisions,
unincorporated entities, d/b/a entities, heirs, assigns, successors,
predecessors, parents, subsidiaries, partners, principals, owners, investors
and shareholders, does hereby mutually agree to knowingly and willingly

liabilities, demands, charges or disputes, whether direct, indirect or
derivative, known or unknown, absolute, matured, contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated claims arising out of, derived from, predicated upon or relating
to the CSA Agreements and the DBCC Lawsuit; provided that this Section 6.13(d)
shall be void and have no effect in the event that this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing.



Section 6.14 No Shop.



(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective Representatives will, and that it will cause each of its
Subsidiaries and each of its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing non-public information), or take any other action to facilitate,
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including any proposal
or offer to the Company Securityholders) with respect to any Competing
Transaction, (ii) enter into, maintain, continue or otherwise engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person or entity in
furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer with respect to
a Competing Transaction, (iii) agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or
consummate any Competing Transaction, (iv) enter into any Competing
Transaction Agreement, or (v) resolve, propose or agree, or authorize or
permit any Representative, to do any of the foregoing. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that the doing of any of the foregoing by any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to be a breach by the Company of this Section 6.14(a). The
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any persons conducted by the Company, 

any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of their Representatives with respect to
a Competing Transaction prior to the execution of this Agreement. The Company
shall promptly request each person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with such person's consideration of
acquiring (whether by merger, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise) the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to return (or if permitted by the
applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all information required to be
returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such person under the terms of the
applicable confidentiality agreement and, if requested by Parent, to enforce
such person's obligation to do so.



(b) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after the
Company attains knowledge thereof) notify Parent, orally and in writing, after
the receipt by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives of any bona fide proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any
amendment thereto) with respect to a Competing Transaction, including any
request for discussions or negotiations and any request for information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Such notice shall include a description of such proposal,
inquiry, offer or request, including the material terms and conditions (if
any) of such proposed Competing Transaction, and the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours after the Company attains knowledge thereof)
provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by the Company in
connection with any of the foregoing; provided that the Company may redact
such materials so as not to disclose the identity of the party making such
proposal, inquiry, offer or request for a Competing Transaction if the
disclosure thereof is prohibited by contract or Law. The Company agrees that
it shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in
the status and any material changes or modifications in the material terms of
any such proposal, inquiry, offer or request.



Section 6.15 Non‑Solicitation.



(a) For a period of thirty-six (36) months commencing on the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), neither GHP nor GHI shall directly, or indirectly via
their controlled portfolio companies, hire or solicit any Senior Employee of
Parent or any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, or
encourage any such employee to leave his or her employment, except pursuant to
a general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any such
employees or the solicitation of any such employee that was terminated by
Parent or any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, prior to
such general solicitation.



(b) The parties acknowledge that a breach or threatened breach of this Section
6.15 would give rise to irreparable harm to Parent and its Affiliates,
including the Surviving Corporation, for which monetary damages would not be
an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by
either GHP or GHI of any such obligations, Parent shall, in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies that may be available to it in respect of
such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a temporary
restraining Order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief
that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction. 



(c) The parties agree that the duration and scope of the non‑solicitation
provisions set forth in this Section 6.15 are reasonable. In the event that
any court of competent jurisdiction determines that the duration, scope or
other limitations set forth in this Section 6.15 are unreasonable and that
such provision is to that extent unenforceable, the parties agree that the
provision shall remain in full force and effect for the greatest time period
and having the broadest limitations that would not render it unenforceable.
The parties intend that the covenants contained in this Section 6.15 shall be
deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one for each and every county of
each and every state of the United States of America. The unenforceability of
any such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any such county shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other such county.



Section 6.16 Section 280G. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
but in any event no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of Section 280G
calculations for its disqualified individuals (within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code). If any person would be subject to any excise tax imposed
under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Company shall provide such person(s)
with the opportunity to subject any payments that could constitute a
"parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code to a stockholder vote
in a manner intended to comply with the stockholder vote requirements under
Section 280G of the Code and the applicable regulations. Prior to providing
the Company Stockholders with any materials necessary to comply with such
stockholder vote, the Company shall provide a copy of such materials to Parent
in sufficient time to allow Parent to comment thereon and shall consider any
such comments in good faith.



Section 6.17 Company Funding Documents. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall have taken all actions necessary to (i) terminate, and shall
cause to be terminated, each Company Funding Document, and (ii) obtain the
release, discharge, removal and termination of all Liens on the Company
Securities and the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising under
any applicable Company Funding Document.



Section 6.18 Invention Assignment Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall have caused each of the employees or third parties listed on
Section 6.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter to execute a valid and
enforceable Contract with the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
pursuant to which such employee or third party transfers to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, such employee's or third party's entire right,
title and interest in and to any Intellectual Property that has been
conceived, developed or created for the Company or the Company Subsidiaries by
such employee or third party.

obligations except to the extent, and only to the extent, such Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party may
undertake and assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within 30 days of
receiving such Third Party Claim Notice with representatives chosen by it.
During such 30‑day period, the Indemnified Party may make such filings,
including motions for continuance (and answers if a motion for continuance has
not been granted), as may be necessary to preserve the parties' positions and
rights with respect to such Third Party Claim (and the reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in connection
therewith shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement). If
the Indemnifying Party undertakes the defense of a Third Party Claim, then (i)
the Indemnified Party may retain separate co‑counsel at its sole cost and
expense but shall not be entitled to any reimbursement with respect thereto
(provided, that if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified
Party, (A) there are legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that
are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party
or (B) there exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for (as "Damages" hereunder) the reasonable and documented fees and
expenses of one separate counsel to the Indemnified Party), (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of
the Third Party Claim and the defense thereof, and (iii) the Indemnifying
Party shall reasonably consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party
with respect thereto.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.3, but in each
case subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 8.3(d)(ii) and Section
2.14(c), the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall not be entitled to assume or
conduct, and the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole
control over, the defense or settlement of (i) the Class Action Litigation
from and after the Closing Date and (ii) any Third Party Claim if (A) such
Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or
quasi criminal Action involving the Parent Indemnified Party; (B) such Third
Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Parent
Indemnified Party; or (C) the Parent Indemnified Party reasonably believes
that the Damages relating to such Third Party Claim could exceed the maximum
amount that such Parent Indemnified Party could then be entitled to recover
under the applicable provisions of this Article VIII.



(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense within 30
days after written notice of any such Third Party Claim, is not entitled to
assign control of the defense in accordance with Section 8.3(b), or thereafter
fails or ceases to defend such Third Party Claim, then, subject to the
restrictions set forth in Section 8.3(d)(ii) (i) the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to undertake and control the defense of such Third Party Claim
upon further advance written notice of five (5) Business Days, (ii) the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party in connection therewith shall be considered "Damages" for purposes of
this Agreement, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall 

thereafter have no right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of
such Third Party Claim.



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.3 to the contrary, (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified
Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment unless such settlement or judgment (A) includes the giving by the
claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of an unconditional release
from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim and (B) does not
involve a finding of admission or wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnified
Party or impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Party, (ii) subject in all cases to Section 2.14(c)(iv),the Indemnified Party
shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, or if the
Indemnifying Party is a Seller Indemnifying Party, the Securityholder
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry
of any judgment unless such settlement or judgment includes (x) the giving by
the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnifying Party of an unconditional
release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim and (y) the
giving by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party of an unconditional
release from all liability under this Agreement in respect of such Third Party
Claim, including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the portion of
the Escrow Funds constituting the Litigation Escrow Indemnification Amount.



(e) The parties hereto shall act in good faith in responding to, defending
against, settling or otherwise dealing with any Third Party Claims, and
cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all information
relevant thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the party
controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim shall (to the extent not
inconsistent with the protection of attorney‑client or other applicable
privilege) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the other party, upon
request, copies of all correspondence, pleadings, motions, briefs, appeals or
other written statements relating to or submitted in connection with the
defense of the Third Party Claim, and timely notices of, and the right to
participate (as an observer) in any hearing or other court proceeding, meeting
or negotiation relating to the Third Party Claim.



Section 8.4 Procedures for Claims Not Involving Third Parties. An Indemnified
Party wishing to assert a claim for indemnification under this Article VIII
that does not involve a Third Party Claim shall deliver a written notice (a
"Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party, which shall (a) state in reasonable
detail the circumstances giving rise to the Damages, (b) specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of this Agreement alleged to
be inaccurate or have been breached or not performed, (c) to the extent then
ascertainable, specify the estimated amount of the Damages (the "Claim
Amount"), and (d) make a request for any payment then believed due. The
Indemnifying Party may, within 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party
of a Claim Notice, deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response
disputing such claim. If no such written response is received by the
Indemnified Party within such 30-day period, then such claim for
indemnification shall be conclusive against the Indemnifying Parties. If the
Indemnifying Party in such written response contests the payment of the Claim
Amount, then the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good
faith 

efforts to arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution of such dispute within
the next 30 days. If a mutually acceptable resolution cannot be reached
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party within such 30‑day
period, then the parties may thereupon proceed to pursue any and all available
remedies at law or equity permitted under this Agreement.



Section 8.5 Survival; Limitations on Liability.



(a) Survival. The representations and warranties of Parent and the Company
(including the Company Fundamental Representations) set forth in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue until the date that is twelve
(12) months following the Closing Date, at which time they shall expire. All
of the covenants set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.



(b) Cap; Threshold.



(i) Except in the case of fraud or willful breach, the maximum aggregate
amount of indemnifiable Damages payable by the Seller Indemnifying Parties
under (A) Section 8.1(a)(i) in respect of all claims made thereunder shall not
exceed the sum of the General Escrow Indemnification Amount (the "General
Indemnification Cap") and in no event shall any Seller Indemnifying Party be
obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for Damages in respect
of such claims in excess of its Pro Rata Indemnity Portion of the General
Indemnification Cap, and (B) Section 8.1(b) in respect of all claims made
thereunder shall not exceed the Litigation Escrow Indemnification Amount (the
"Litigation Indemnification Cap" and, together with the General
Indemnification Cap, the "Cap"), and in no event shall any Seller Indemnifying
Party be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties for Litigation
Losses in respect of such claims in excess of its Pro Rata Indemnity Portion
of the Litigation Indemnification Cap. Except in the case of fraud or willful
breach, Parent hereby agrees (on behalf of itself and the other Parent
Indemnified Parties) that, from and after the Effective Time, indemnification
claims made by any Parent Indemnified Party that are subject to the Cap shall
be satisfied solely from the Escrow Amount, unless otherwise explicitly stated
in any of the Transaction Documents. In the event that the amount held in the
Escrow Account is reduced to zero as a result of payments made in respect of
indemnification claims pursuant to this Article VIII, whether at or prior to
the 12‑month anniversary of the Closing Date, except in the case of fraud or
willful breach, the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall have no further
obligation to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of any
indemnification claim subject to the Cap except as provided in the previous
sentence.



(ii) The indemnity obligations of the Seller Indemnifying Parties that are not
subject to the Cap shall be satisfied (x) first, by recourse against the
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement for so long as any amounts remain in the Escrow Account, and (y)
thereafter, by the Seller Indemnifying Parties based on their respective Pro
Rata Indemnity Portions. For purposes of this Article VIII, "Pro Rata
Indemnity Portion" and "Cap" shall be calculated as of the date that any
indemnification or other payment is to be made.



(iii) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for
Damages claimed under Section 8.1(a)(i) unless and until (A) the aggregate

amount of all Damages incurred by such Parent Indemnified Party in respect of
such claims, taken together, exceeds $1,000,000, at which time the full amount
of all such Damages incurred shall be indemnifiable claims hereunder (subject
to all the other terms and conditions set forth herein) and (B) with respect
to any individual indemnification claim, the aggregate amount of Damages
arising from such individual indemnification claim or series of related claims
exceeds $25,000; provided, that the limitations 

set forth in this Section 8.5(b)(iii) shall not apply in respect of any claims
under any of the Company Fundamental Representations and with respect to
Taxes.



(c) Other Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) no Indemnified Party shall make an indemnification claim
hereunder for Damages for which written notice of the underlying claim was not
duly delivered to the Indemnifying Party within the applicable time limitation
set forth in Section 8.5(a), , (ii) Damages arising from any breach of a
representation or warranty shall be calculated without giving effect to any
limitation as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" or words of like
meaning set forth therein, except with respect to the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3.7(b) and clause (a) of
Section 3.8), (iii) no Seller Indemnifying Party will be liable for any
Damages pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(ii) in respect of a breach of a covenant or
agreement unless the Company (with respect to the Pre-Closing period), such
Seller Indemnifying Party or any of their Affiliates or Representatives has
committed such breach, (iv) no Seller Indemnifying Party will be liable for
any Damages pursuant to this Agreement arising from, in respect of or relating
to (A) any state or local sales or use Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or (B) the breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement set forth in this Agreement with respect to state or
local sales or use Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and (v) no Seller
Indemnifying Party will be liable for any fraud or willful breach under this
Agreement unless the Company (with respect to the Pre-Closing Period), such
Seller Indemnifying Party or any of their Affiliates or Representatives has
committed such fraud or willful breach. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, except (A) for the right to specifically enforce the provisions of
this Agreement as provided in Section 11.7, (B) for payment of Taxes as
provided in Section 2.13 and Section 9.1(a), and (C) with respect to fraud or
willful breach, the rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Article VIII
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties with
respect to claims under this Agreement after the execution of this Agreement,
and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Securityholder Representative
or any Company Securityholder shall have any other rights or remedies in
connection with any breach of this Agreement or any other liability arising
out of the negotiation, entry into or consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, strict
liability, other Laws or otherwise. All representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement are contractual in nature only and subject to the sole
and exclusive remedies set forth in this Article VIII. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the parties in this Agreement shall give rise to any
right on the part of any Indemnified Party, after the Closing, to rescind this
Agreement or any of the Transactions. In quantifying the amount of any Damages
of the Indemnified Party under this Article VIII, there will be subtracted the
amount of any (1) insurance proceeds (net of Taxes actually incurred and net
of any increased premiums, deductibles or other costs actually incurred
relating to the receipt of such proceeds and attributable to any such
Damages), other than proceeds received through self‑insurance or insurance
provided by Affiliates of such Indemnified Party, actually received by the
Indemnified 

Party with respect to such Damages; provided, however, with respect to any
Litigation Losses owed by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.1(b),
any such insurance proceeds will accrue fully to the benefit of the
Indemnifying Party such that such insurance proceeds will reduce in full on a
dollar-for-dollar basis any amounts owed by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section 8.1(b), and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to enforce any
rights (including by instituting an Action) of the Indemnified Party to
recover any such insurance proceeds with respect to (a) matters relating to or
arising out of the Class Action Litigation and (b) other matters for which the
Indemnifying Party is required to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder,
in each case, from insurance carriers and policies of the Company in existence
prior to the Closing, provided that in the event Parent submits a claim for
insurance from any such insurance carrier which is denied, (X) Parent shall be
entitled to recover any amounts it is entitled to be indemnified for pursuant
to this Article VIII from the applicable Escrow Amount and (Y) the
Indemnifying Party may enforce any rights it may have under such insurance
policies, (2) any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party that
arises from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages (taking into account
any Tax cost actually incurred by the Indemnified Party that arises from the
receipt or accrual of any indemnity payment), and (3) third‑party payments
actually received by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Damages (net
of Taxes actually incurred). Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its
Affiliates to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate Damages, to the extent it
is reasonably feasible to do so, upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto.
In computing the amount of Tax benefit or Tax cost referred to in clause (2)
above, (x) the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items
of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit, and shall take into account any
available Tax attributes (e.g., net operating loss or credit carryforwards),
before recognizing any item arising out of the incurrence or payment of any
Damages or the accrual or receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder, and (y)
the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have actually realized a Tax benefit
or Tax cost to the extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes
payable by such Indemnified Party is reduced below or increased above, as the
case may be, the amount of Taxes that such Indemnified Party would be required
to pay but for the incurrence or payment of such Damages or the accrual or
receipt of the indemnity payment, as the case may be. In the event that the
Indemnifying Parties reimburse the Indemnified Party for any Damages prior to
the occurrence of any events contemplated by clauses (1), (2) or (3) above,
the Indemnified Party will remit to the Indemnifying Party any such amounts
that the Indemnified Party subsequently receives or realizes with respect to
such Damages. Upon the payment in full of any claim hereunder, the
Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to the rights of the Indemnified Party
against any Person with respect to the subject matter of such claim. The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party's sole expense, in the assertion by the Indemnifying Party
of any such claim against such other Persons.



(d) No Liability Prior to Acquisition.



(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Seller Indemnifying
Party shall have any liability whatsoever under this Agreement to any Parent
Indemnified Party in respect of (A) the period prior to the closing of those
transactions contemplated under the Asset Purchase Agreement, and (B) any act,
omission, circumstance or occurrence during such period. 



(ii) The parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.3, or the DGCL, including DGCL
Section 259, the indemnification rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
(as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) provided under the Asset Purchase
Agreement, shall remain in all respects the rights of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties as such are defined immediately prior to the Effective
Time, without giving effect to the Transactions. Such Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, including without limitation GHP and GHI, are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 8.5(d)(ii).



Section 8.6 Securityholder Representative and the Company Common
Securityholder Representative.



(a) For purposes of the Transaction Documents (other than the Earn‑Out
Agreement), the Transactions and in any Action involving the Transaction
Documents (other than the Earn-Out Agreement), each Company Securityholder
shall, without any further action on the part of any such Company
Securityholder, be deemed to have consented to the appointment of the
Securityholder Representative as the representative of such Company
Securityholder, as the attorney‑in‑fact for and on behalf of each such Company
Securityholder, and the taking by the Securityholder Representative of any and
all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken
by them under or contemplated by the Transaction Documents (other than the
Earn-Out Agreement) in each case, as applicable. In connection therewith, the
Securityholder Representative shall have the power and authority, on behalf of
the Company Securityholders, as applicable, to:



(i) to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents (other than the Earn-Out
Agreement) (with such modifications or changes therein as to which the
Securityholder Representative, in its sole discretion, shall have consented,
except for any such modification or change that, by Law, requires further
approval by the Company Stockholders) and to agree to such amendments or
modifications thereto as the Securityholder Representative, in its sole
discretion, determine to be desirable;



(ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with, and
amendments to, this Agreement as the Securityholder Representative, in its
sole discretion, determines to be desirable;



(iii) to receive funds and make payment of funds pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Transaction Documents (other than the Earn-Out Agreement),
including the authorization of delivery to a Parent Indemnified Party of all
or any portion of the Escrowed Proceeds in satisfaction of an indemnification
claim made by such Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII or
pursuant to Section 2.16, and give receipts for funds;



(iv) as the Securityholder Representative, to enforce and protect the rights
and interests of the Company Securityholders and to enforce and protect the
rights and interests of the Securityholder Representative arising out of or
under or in any manner relating to this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents (other than the Earn-Out Agreement), and each other agreement,
document, instrument or certificate referred to herein or therein or the
transactions provided for herein or therein (including in connection with any
and all claims for 

indemnification brought under this Article VIII hereof), and to take any and
all actions which the Securityholder Representative believes are necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf
of the Company Securityholders, including asserting or pursuing any claim,
action, proceeding or investigation against Parent or its Affiliates;



(v) to refrain from enforcing any right of any Company Securityholders and/or
the Securityholder Representative arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement; provided, however,
that no such failure to act on the part of the Securityholder Representative,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement,
shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Securityholder
Representative or by such Company Securityholder; and



(vi) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Securityholder
Representative, in its sole discretion, deems desirable in connection with, or
to carry out the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.



(b) Great Hill Equity Partners IV, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership,
hereby accepts its appointment as the Securityholder Representative. The
Securityholder Representative is authorized by each Company Securityholder to
act on such holder's behalf as required under the Transaction Documents (other
than the Earn-Out Agreement). In the event that the Securityholder
Representative becomes unable to perform its responsibilities hereunder or
resigns from such position, the Company Securityholders that received the
majority of the Merger Consideration may appoint a new representative to fill
the vacancy of the Securityholder Representative by sending written notice and
a copy of the duly executed written consent of such Company Securityholders
appointing such new Securityholder Representative to Parent and the Escrow
Agent and such substituted representative shall be deemed to be the
Securityholder Representative for all purposes of the Transaction Documents
(other than the Earn-Out Agreement). Such removal and appointment shall be
effective upon the later of the date indicated in the written consent or the
date such written consent is received by Parent and the Escrow Agent.



(c) Each Company Securityholder hereby agrees to receive correspondence from
the Securityholder Representative, including in electronic form.



(d) The Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to the payment of all
its expenses incurred as the Company Securityholders' representative
hereunder. In connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, and any instrument, agreement or document relating hereto or
thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers
conferred upon the Securityholder Representative hereunder (i) the
Securityholder Representative shall not incur any responsibility whatsoever to
any Company Securityholder by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow
Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only
responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful
misconduct or fraud, and (ii) the Securityholder Representative shall be
entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other
independent experts experienced in the matter at 

issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the
Securityholder Representative pursuant to such advice shall in no event
subject the Securityholder Representative to liability to any Company
Securityholder. Each Company Securityholder shall indemnify the Securityholder
Representative against its ratable share of all losses, damages, liabilities,
claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys',
accountants' and other experts' fees and the amount of any judgment against
them, of any nature whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all
expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims
whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any claim, investigation,
challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof,
relating to the acts or omissions of the Securityholder Representative
hereunder, or under the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in its capacity as the
Company Securityholders' representative hereunder. The foregoing
indemnification shall not apply in the event of any Action which finally
adjudicates the liability of the Securityholder Representative hereunder for
its willful misconduct or fraud. In the event of any indemnification
hereunder, upon written notice from the Securityholder Representative to the
Company Securityholders as to the existence of a deficiency toward the payment
of any such indemnification amount, each Company Securityholder shall promptly
deliver to the Securityholder Representative full payment of his, her or its
ratable share of the amount of such deficiency. If not paid directly to the
Securityholder Representative by the Company Securityholders, any such
outstanding indemnification amount may be recovered by the Securityholder
Representative from the amounts in the Escrow Account otherwise distributable
to the Company Securityholders pursuant to the terms hereof and the Escrow
Agreement at the time of distribution in accordance with written instructions
delivered by the Securityholder Representative to the Escrow Agent (it being
understood that no such distribution shall be comprised of amounts otherwise
distributable to Parent); provided that while this section allows the
Securityholder Representative to be paid from the Escrow Account, this does
not relieve the Company Securityholders from their obligation to promptly pay
such indemnification amounts as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Securityholder Representative from seeking any remedies available
to it at law or otherwise.



(e) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Securityholder Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing
Date and/or any termination of this Agreement.



(f) Parent shall have the right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to
be taken by the Securityholder Representative pursuant to this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents (other than the Earn-Out Agreement), all of
which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon the Company
Securityholders.



(g) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Company Securityholder and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Transactions.



(h) The Merger Consideration payable to the Company Securityholders hereunder
will be paid to the Company Securityholders in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and in a manner consistent with the Company Organizational
Documents, as in effect as of the date hereof. 





(i) For purposes of the Earn-Out Agreement and in any Action involving the
Earn-Out Agreement, each Company Common Securityholder shall, without any
further action on the part of any such Company Common Securityholder, be
deemed to have consented to the appointment of the Company Common
Securityholder Representative as the representative of such Company Common
Securityholder, as the attorney‑in‑fact for and on behalf of each such Company
Common Securityholder, and the taking by the Company Common Securityholder
Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required
or permitted to be taken by them under or contemplated by the Earn-Out
Agreement. In connection therewith, the Company Common Securityholder
Representative shall have the power and authority, on behalf of the Company
Common Securityholders, as applicable, to:



(i) to execute and deliver the Earn-Out Agreement (with such modifications or
changes therein as to which the Company Common Securityholder Representative,
in its sole discretion, shall have consented, except for any such modification
or change that, by Law, requires further approval by the Company Stockholders)
and to agree to such amendments or modifications thereto as the Company Common
Securityholder Representative, in its sole discretion, determine to be
desirable;



(ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with, and
amendments to, the Earn-Out Agreement as the Company Common Securityholder
Representative, in its sole discretion, determines to be desirable;



(iii) to receive funds and make payment of funds pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Earn-Out Agreement and give receipts for funds;



(iv) as the Company Common Securityholder Representative, to enforce and
protect the rights and interests of the Company Common Securityholders and to
enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Company Common
Securityholder Representative arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to the Earn-Out Agreement, and each other agreement, document,
instrument or certificate referred to therein or the transactions provided for
therein, and to take any and all actions which the Company Common
Securityholder Representative believes are necessary or appropriate under the
Earn-Out Agreement for and on behalf of the Company Common Securityholders,
including asserting or pursuing any claim, action, proceeding or investigation
against Parent or its Affiliates;



(v) to refrain from enforcing any right of any Company Common Securityholders
and/or the Company Common Securityholder Representative arising out of or
under or in any manner relating to the Earn-Out Agreement; provided, however,
that no such failure to act on the part of the Company Common Securityholder
Representative, except as otherwise provided in the Earn-Out Agreement, shall
be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Company Common
Securityholder Representative or by such Company Common Securityholder; and



(vi) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Company Common
Securityholder Representative, in its sole 

discretion, deems desirable in connection with, or to carry out the
transactions contemplated by, the Earn-Out Agreement.



(j) Jeffrey M. Stibel, hereby accepts its appointment as the Company Common
Securityholder Representative. The Company Common Securityholder
Representative is authorized by each Company Common Securityholder to act on
such holder's behalf as required under the Earn-Out Agreement. In the event
that the Company Common Securityholder Representative becomes unable to
perform its responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the
Company Common Securityholders that received the majority of the Merger
Consideration received by the Company Common Securityholders may appoint a new
representative to fill the vacancy of the Company Common Securityholder
Representative by sending written notice and a copy of the duly executed
written consent of such Company Common Securityholders appointing such new
Company Common Securityholder Representative to Parent and such substituted
representative shall be deemed to be the Company Common Securityholder
Representative for all purposes of the Earn-Out Agreement. Such removal and
appointment shall be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the
written consent or the date such written consent is received by Parent.



(k) Each Company Common Securityholder hereby agrees to receive correspondence
from the Company Common Securityholder Representative, including in electronic
form.



(l) The Company Common Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to the
payment of all its expenses incurred as the Company Common Securityholders'
representative hereunder. In connection with the Earn-Out Agreement, and any
instrument, agreement or document relating thereto, and in exercising or
failing to exercise all or any of the powers conferred upon the Company Common
Securityholder Representative hereunder (i) the Company Common Securityholder
Representative shall not incur any responsibility whatsoever to any Company
Common Securityholder by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted in connection with the Earn-Out Agreement or any
such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only responsibility
for any act or failure to act which represents willful misconduct or fraud,
and (ii) the Company Common Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to
rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or
omission of the Company Common Securityholder Representative pursuant to such
advice shall in no event subject the Company Common Securityholder
Representative to liability to any Company Common Securityholder. Each Company
Common Securityholder shall indemnify the Company Common Securityholder
Representative against its ratable share of all losses, damages, liabilities,
claims, obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys',
accountants' and other experts' fees and the amount of any judgment against
them, of any nature whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all
expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims
whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any claim, investigation,
challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof,
relating to the acts or omissions of the Company Common Securityholder
Representative under the Earn-Out Agreement or otherwise in its capacity as
the Company Common Securityholders' representative hereunder. The foregoing
indemnification shall not apply in the event of any Action which finally 

adjudicates the liability of the Company Common Securityholder Representative
under the Earn‑Out Agreement for its willful misconduct or fraud. In the event
of any indemnification hereunder, upon written notice from the Company Common
Securityholder Representative to the Company Common Securityholders as to the
existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any such indemnification
amount, each Company Common Securityholder shall promptly deliver to the
Company Common Securityholder Representative full payment of his, her or its
ratable share of the amount of such deficiency. If not paid directly to the
Company Common Securityholder Representative by the Company Common
Securityholders, any such outstanding indemnification amount may be recovered
by the Company Common Securityholder Representative from the amounts
distributable to the Company Common Securityholders pursuant to the Earn-Out
Agreement; provided that while this section allows the Company Common
Securityholder Representative to be paid from the Earn-Out Agreement, this
does not relieve the Company Common Securityholders from their obligation to
promptly pay such indemnification amounts as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Company Common Securityholder Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.



(m) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Company
Common Securityholder Representative under this Agreement shall survive the
Closing Date and/or any termination of this Agreement.



(n) Parent shall have the right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to
be taken by the Company Common Securityholder Representative pursuant to the
Earn-Out Agreement, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding
upon the Company Common Securityholders.



(o) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Company Common Securityholder and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Transactions.



Section 8.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Provisions. The parties agree
that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.



Section 8.8 Conflicts. To the extent there is a conflict between the
provisions of this Article VIII and the provisions set forth in Article IX,
the provisions set forth in Article IX shall govern.



ARTICLE IX



TAX MATTERS



Section 9.1 Tax Returns.



(a) Except as provided in Section 9.7, after the Closing, with respect to Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries for 

the Pre‑Closing Taxable Period or Straddle Period, Parent shall file or cause
to be filed such Tax Returns when due (taking into account any applicable
extensions). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent shall
deliver any such Tax Return to the Securityholder Representative for its
review at least thirty (30) days (or ten (10) days in the case of Tax returns
for non-income Taxes) prior to the date on which such Tax Return is required
to be filed. If the Securityholder Representative disputes any item on such
Tax Return relating to Taxes for which Parent is entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to Article VIII, then it shall notify Parent of such disputed item
(or items) and the basis for its objection. Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to
the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to be filed. If Parent
and the Securityholder Representative cannot resolve any disputed item, then
the item in question shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm. The costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by the Company
Securityholders, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand. If such
dispute process is not completed by the due date for the applicable Tax Return
(including extensions obtained in the ordinary course), such Tax Return shall
be filed by Parent with only such revisions as have been agreed to by Parent;
provided that following the resolution of any dispute the Parent shall make
any necessary amendments to such Tax Return. Parent shall timely pay the
amount of Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns; provided that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no later than
three (3) days before the due date (including extensions obtained) for any
such Tax Return, the Securityholder Representative shall pay to Parent, using
funds other than the Escrow Funds, the amount of Taxes shown as due on such
Tax Return, in the case of a Tax Return for a Pre‑Closing Taxable Period, and
the amount of Taxes that are allocable pursuant to Section 9.1(b) to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, in the case of a
Tax Return for a Straddle Period; provided, however, that, the Securityholder
Representative shall not be required to pay any amount of such Taxes unless
the aggregate amount of such Taxes exceeds the aggregate amount of Taxes that
were reflected on the Final Statement.



(b) For purposes of preparing any Tax Return described in Section 9.1(a), the
parties hereto shall treat the taxable year of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as ending on the Closing Date where required or allowable by
applicable Law. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of Taxes that are
payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be: (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related
to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other
transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible),
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended on
the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis or
otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the period ending on, and including, the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.



Section 9.2 Contest Provisions. 



(a) After the Closing, Parent shall promptly notify the Securityholder
Representative in writing of any written notice of a proposed assessment or
claim for Taxes in an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding of Parent
and its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) which, if
determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be grounds for indemnification
under Article VIII; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice
will not affect Parent's right to indemnification under Article VIII except to
the extent, if any, that, but for such failure, the Seller Indemnifying
Parties could have avoided all or a portion of the Tax liability in question.



(b) Subject to Section 9.2(c) and Section 9.7, in the case of an audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding that relates to a Pre‑Closing Taxable
Period, the Securityholder Representative shall have the right at its expense
to participate in and control the conduct of such audit or proceeding;
provided that the Securityholder Representative shall not settle such audit or
proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Parent may also participate in
any such audit or proceeding and, if the Securityholder Representative does
not assume the defense of any such audit or proceeding, Parent may defend the
same in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including settling such audit
or proceeding.



(c) Subject to Section 9.7, in the case of an audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding that relates to a Straddle Period or where Parent and the
Seller Indemnifying Parties may both be liable, (i) both the Securityholder
Representative and Parent may participate in the audit or proceeding and (ii)
the audit or proceeding shall be controlled by that party which would bear the
burden of the greater portion of the proposed adjustment and any corresponding
adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for future taxable periods;
provided that the controlling party shall not settle such audit or proceeding
without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).



Section 9.3 Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements. Any and all Tax
allocation or sharing agreements or other agreements or arrangements relating
to Tax matters ("Tax Sharing Agreements") to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries is a party, other than any Tax Sharing Agreements solely among
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor its Subsidiaries shall have any liability thereunder.



Section 9.4 Assistance and Cooperation. The Securityholder Representative and
Parent agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request,
as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and
records) and assistance relating to the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns and
the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding. The Securityholder Representative and
Parent shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit
or administrative or judicial proceeding or other proceeding involving or
otherwise relating to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries (or their income or assets) with respect to any Tax. Any
information obtained under this Section 9.4 shall be kept confidential, except
as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
in the conduct of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or other
Tax proceeding. 



Section 9.5 Refunds.



(a) The Company Securityholders will be entitled to any refunds (including
interest received thereon) in respect of any Taxes for which Parent is
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Article VIII. Parent shall cause such
refund to be paid to the Securityholder Representative promptly after it is
received; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 9.5, if, and to the extent that, as of such time, Parent is owed
indemnification payments or has pending claims for indemnification under
Article VIII, in each case with respect to Taxes, Parent may set off such owed
indemnification payments with such refund or Parent may retain all or part of
such refund pending satisfaction (or set off) of any amounts in respect of
such pending claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any Tax refund
for a period ending on or before the Closing Date arising out of the carryback
of a loss or credit incurred by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
in a taxable year beginning after the Closing Date shall be the property of
Parent and, if received by any Company Securityholder or the Securityholder
Representative, shall be payable promptly to Parent.



(b) Except as provided in Section 9.5(a), the Surviving Corporation will be
entitled to any refunds (including any interest received thereon) in respect
of any Tax liability of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries.



Section 9.6 Conveyance Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent, on the one hand, and the Company Securityholders, on the
other hand, shall each be responsible for, and shall pay, fifty percent (50%)
of any sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary,
excise, real property transfer, or similar Taxes incurred as a result of the
Merger.



Section 9.7 Sales and Use Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, (a) Parent shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that relate to state or local sales or use
Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and neither the Securityholder
Representative nor the Company Securityholders shall have any rights to review
or dispute any items included in such Tax Returns, and (b) Parent shall
control all audits or administrative or judicial proceedings of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that relate to state or local sales or use Taxes of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and shall have the right to settle any such audit
or proceeding in its sole discretion, and neither the Securityholder
Representative nor the Company Securityholders shall have any rights to
participate in, control, or consent to the settlement of, any such audits or
proceedings.



ARTICLE X



TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:



(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;



(b) by Parent, upon a breach of or failure to perform any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this 

Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions
set forth in Section 7.2 not to be satisfied and (ii) if curable, has not been
cured by the earlier of (x) fifteen (15) days following the earlier of receipt
by the Company of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from
Parent, and (y) one Business Day prior to the earlier of the Outside Date and
the date on which this Agreement may be terminated by Parent pursuant to this
Section 10.1; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available if Parent is then in breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement
such that the condition in Section 7.3(a) or (b) could not be satisfied by
Parent;



(c) by the Company, upon a breach of or failure to perform any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 7.3 not to be satisfied and (ii) if curable,
has not been cured within the earlier of (x) fifteen (15) days following the
earlier of receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or failure to
perform from the Company, and (y) one Business Day prior to the earlier of the
Outside Date and the date on which this Agreement may be terminated by the
Company pursuant to this Section 10.1; provided, that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c) shall not be available if the
Company is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements in this Agreement such that the condition in Section 7.2(a) or
(b) could not be satisfied by the Company;



(d) by either Parent or the Company, if there shall be any Order which is
final and nonappealable restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Transactions on the terms set forth herein or that makes
consummation of the Transactions on the terms set forth herein illegal; or



(e) by either Parent or the Company, if the Closing shall not have occurred by
the six (6) month anniversary of the date hereof (the "Outside Date");
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.1(e) shall not be available to any party whose breach of or failure
to perform any material covenant or agreement hereunder is the principal cause
of the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such Outside Date.



Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, this Agreement shall immediately become
void, there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, any of their respective Affiliates or their or their
Affiliates' respective Representatives, stockholders, managers or partners and
all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except that any
such termination shall not relieve any party hereto from any liability for any
and all of the Damages suffered by the other party hereto as a result of any
willful or intentional breach of such party's representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of this Section 10.2, Section 10.3, and Article XI
shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this
Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of
the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement. 



Section 10.3 Fees, Costs and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 2.13(a),
Section 6.1, Section 9.1(a), Section 9.6 and as set forth in the Escrow
Agreement, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions hereby shall be paid by the party incurring
such expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated. For the
avoidance of doubt, following the Closing, all legal fees of GHP, GHI, the
Securityholder Representative or any other Company Securityholder shall be
borne solely by such party, whether or not related to the Class Action
Litigation or any other matter.



Section 10.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by the written
consent of each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, GHP, GHI and the
Securityholder Representative, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors (or equivalent bodies), at any time before or
after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approvals, but, after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approvals, no amendment shall be made which by Law
requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval.



Section 10.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto entitled to the benefits thereof, by action taken or authorized
by its respective board of directors, may, to the extent permitted by Law (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, and (c)
waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Such
extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance,
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any
agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified
in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.



Section 10.6 Litigation.



(a) The Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and the Company
Securityholders shall not use any non‑public documents or non‑public
information concerning Parent or any of its Affiliates that was notified to
the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any Company Securityholder by
Parent or its Affiliates or in connection with discussions related to the
Transactions or the Transaction Documents against Parent or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the Class Action Litigation, the DBCC Lawsuit or
the CSA Agreements.



(b) Parent and its Affiliates shall not use any non‑public documents or
non‑public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that was
notified to Parent and its Affiliates by Company, its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, or any Company Securityholder, or in connection with discussions
related to the Transactions or the Transaction Documents against the Company
and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Class Action Litigation, the DBCC
Lawsuit or the CSA Agreements.



(c) For the avoidance of doubt, all applicable Laws related to the
confidentiality of settlement discussions shall apply to any discussions among
the parties related 

to the Class Action Litigation, the DBCC Lawsuit or the CSA Agreements,
including CPLR §4547 and Federal Rule of Evidence 408.

Section 11.2 Headings; Table of Contents. The headings and table of contents
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



Section 11.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner that would be
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible.



Section 11.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits
hereto and the Company Disclosure Letter), the other Transaction Documents and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties,
and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
among the parties or between any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.



Section 11.5 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
provided, that each of Parent and Merger Sub may assign this Agreement or any
of its rights (but not its obligations) hereunder to one or more of its
Affiliates without the consent of the Securityholder Representative. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.



Section 11.6 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and, except as set forth in
Section 6.3, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.



Section 11.7 Specific Performance. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the Transactions, will cause irreparable injury to the
other parties for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article X, the parties shall be entitled, without
posting a bond or similar indemnity, to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court as specified
in Section 11.11, in addition to any other right or remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. 



Section 11.8 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure
or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement
herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. Except as otherwise
explicitly provided for elsewhere herein, all rights and remedies existing
under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not
exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.



Section 11.9 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.



(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF LAW OR
CONFLICTING PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE
STATE OF DELAWARE TO BE APPLIED. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, THE INTERNAL
LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WILL CONTROL THE INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION
OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF UNDER SUCH JURISDICTION'S CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT
OF LAW ANALYSIS, THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW OF SOME OTHER JURISDICTION WOULD
ORDINARILY APPLY. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT SUCH PARTY MAY LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO,
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREUNDER.



(b) ANY AND ALL SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ANY OTHER NOTICE IN ANY SUCH CLAIM
SHALL BE EFFECTIVE AGAINST ANY PARTY IF GIVEN PERSONALLY OR BY REGISTERED OR
CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS OF MAIL THAT
REQUIRES A SIGNED RECEIPT, POSTAGE PREPAID, MAILED TO SUCH PARTY AS HEREIN
PROVIDED. NOTHING HEREIN CONTAINED SHALL BE DEEMED TO AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY
PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY IN ANY OTHER
JURISDICTION.



(c) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE WAIVER
IN SECTION 11.9(A), (II) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS, AGREEMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN SECTION
11.9 AND THIS SECTION 11.9(C).



Section 11.10 Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege. 



(a) Acknowledgment of Prior Representation. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that each of Goodwin Procter LLP, Proskauer Rose LLP,
Gibson Dunn and Crutcher, Stubbs Alderton, Markiles, LLP, Latham and Watkins LLP
(collectively, "DBCC Outside Counsel") and in-house legal counsel for DBCC
("DBCC In-house Counsel," and collectively with DBCC Outside Counsel, "DBCC
Counsel") has acted as counsel to one or more of the Company, the Company's
Subsidiary, the Securityholder Representative and/or the Sellers in connection
with various matters, including the DBCC Lawsuit, negotiation of the CSA
Agreements, the Class Action Litigation, disputes and negotiations with
Parent, and/or the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transactions.



(b) Consent to Future Representation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby
consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, DBCC Outside
Counsel, or any of DBCC Outside Counsel, representing the Securityholder
Representative and/or any or all of the Sellers (collectively, the "Seller
Parties") after the Closing, including with respect to disputes in which the
interests of the Seller Parties may be directly adverse to Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), and
even though DBCC Outside Counsel, or any of DBCC Outside Counsel, may have
represented the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries in a matter
substantially related to any such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters
for the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries and/or various of the Seller
Parties. Parent further consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the
Company and the Company's Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, the
communication by or any of DBCC Outside Counsel, or any of DBCC Outside
Counsel, to the Seller Parties in connection with any such representation of
any fact known to DBCC Outside Counsel, or any of DBCC Outside Counsel to the
extent (i) arising by reason of DBCC Outside Counsel, or any of DBCC Outside
Counsel's, prior representation of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries
and/or the Seller Parties and (ii) not otherwise subject to an attorney-client
privilege between any of DBCC Counsel, on the one hand, and a third party
other than the Seller Parties or the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries, on
the other hand.



(c) Waiver of Conflicts. In connection with the foregoing, following the
Closing, Parent hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees
to cause, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation's
Subsidiaries to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest
arising from or in connection with (i) DBCC Outside Counsel, or any of DBCC
Outside Counsel's prior representation of the Company and the Company's
Subsidiaries and/or the Seller Parties and (ii) any of DBCC Outside Counsel,
or any of DBCC Outside Counsel's representation of the Securityholder
Representative and the Sellers prior to and after the Closing.



(d) Definition and Ownership of Privileged Communications. The parties hereby
agree, subject to compliance with the terms, conditions and procedures set
forth in Section 11.10 of the Seller Disclosure Letter and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including Section 2.3, Section
5.2, Section 6.7, or the DGCL, including DGCL Section 259, that (i) all
Privileged Communications exclusively related to the Transaction Matters shall
be deemed to be owned and controlled collectively by the Sellers, (ii) all
Privileged Communications exclusively related to the DBCC Lawsuit shall be
deemed to be owned and controlled collectively by the Sellers, (iii) all
Privileged Communications related, in part, to the Transaction Matters or the 

DBCC Lawsuit, which communications have been redacted to remove all
communications other than the Privileged Communications related to the
Transaction Matters or the DBCC Lawsuit as set forth on Section 11.10 of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the communications referred to in clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii), the "Retained Privileged Communications"), shall be deemed to be
owned and controlled, as redacted, collectively by the Sellers, (iv) all
Privileged Communications related, in part, to the Transaction Matters or the
DBCC Lawsuit, which communications have been redacted to remove all Privileged
Communications related to the Transaction Matters or the DBCC Lawsuit as set
forth on Section 11.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be deemed to be
owned and controlled, as redacted, by the Surviving Corporation, and (v) all
other communications, including any Privileged Communications and any non-
privileged communications between or among any of DBCC Counsel, on the one
hand, and the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
present or former directors, officers, employees or other representatives, on
the other hand (collectively, the communications referred to in clauses (iv)
and (v), the "Parent Communications"), shall be deemed to be owned and
controlled by the Surviving Corporation. All Parent Communications shall be
transferred to the Surviving Corporation in connection with the consummation
of the Merger in the same format and location (e.g., email server) as such
communications were stored by the Company in the ordinary course of business
prior to Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Closing, the
Company shall hire a reputable, nationally recognized eDiscovery firm that is
reasonably acceptable to Parent (the "eDiscovery Firm") to examine all
communications involving DBCC Counsel and relating to or involving the
Company, the Company's Subsidiary, or any of their respective present or
former directors, officers, securityholders, employees or other
representatives (including all Privileged Communications) in accordance with
the procedures and guidelines set forth on Section 11.10 of the Company
Disclosure Letter. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the eDiscovery Firm to complete step 1 set forth on Section 11.10 of the
Company Disclosure Letter as soon as practicable after the date hereof and the
Company and the Securityholder Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the eDiscovery Firm to complete steps 2-4 set
forth on Section 11.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter as soon as practicable
after the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, all communications which are
not ultimately reviewed by the eDiscovery Firm shall be deemed Parent
Communications.



(e) Exclusions for Third Party Claims and Legally Required Disclosure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises following
the Closing Date between (i)(A) one or more Seller Parties (and no other
parties) or (B) Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation's
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand (the parties in
clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) each being a "Disputing Party"), and (ii) a third
party (other than (A) the Seller Parties or (B) Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates, as applicable), on the other hand, the Disputing Party may assert
the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to such third party of the
Privileged Communications owned and controlled by the other party pursuant to
Section 11.10(d); provided, however, that the Disputing Party may not waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of the party(ies) that owns
and controls such Privileged Communications. In the event that the Disputing
Party is legally required by Order to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Privileged Communications owned and controlled by the other
party pursuant to Section 11.10(d), the Disputing Party shall immediately
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify such other party in
writing (including by making 

specific reference to this Section) so such other party can seek a protective
order and the Disputing Party agrees to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to assist therewith.



(f) No Duty to Disclose Privileged Communications. To the extent that files
or other materials maintained by DBCC Outside Counsel, or any of DBCC Outside
Counsel constitute property of their clients (as opposed to property of DBCC
Outside counsel), and such files constitute Retained Privileged
Communications, only the Sellers shall hold such property rights and DBCC
Outside Counsel, or any of DBCC Outside Counsel, shall have no duty to reveal
or disclose any such files or other materials which constitute Retained
Privileged Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between DBCC Outside Counsel, or any of DBCC Outside Counsel, on the one hand,
and Parent, the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries, on the other hand. To
the extent that files or other materials maintained by any of DBCC Outside
Counsel constitute property of their clients (as opposed to property of DBCC
Outside Counsel), and such files constitute Parent Communications, only the
Surviving Corporation shall hold such property rights and DBCC Outside Counsel
shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or other materials or
any Parent Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between DBCC Outside Counsel, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other
hand. Nothing herein shall require any of DBCC Outside Counsel to review,
segregate or categorize any files maintained by any of DBCC Outside Counsel
absent a request by Sellers for Retained Privileged Communications or by
Parent for Parent Communications, in which case the DBCC Outside Counsel
receiving a request for such files it maintains shall review, segregate and
provide such files to the requesting party following receipt of payment from
the requesting party for all fees, costs and disbursements of such review,
segregation and production, including fees of any vendor or vendors retained
by the DBCC Outside Counsel to assist in such review, segregation and
production.



(g) Prohibition on Access to or Use of Seller Communications; Right to
Protect/Remove Seller Communications. Unless otherwise provided herein, (i)
Parent agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries not to, (A) access or
use any Retained Privileged Communications, including by way of review of any
electronic data, communications or other information, or by seeking to have
the Securityholder Representative, or any Seller waive the attorney-client or
other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries has the right to waive
the attorney-client or other privilege or any contractual or other right or
claim of access or use, or (B) seek to obtain the Retained Privileged
Communications from DBCC Counsel, and (ii) the Seller Parties agree that they
will not, and that they will cause their respective Subsidiaries and
affiliates not to, (A) access or use any Parent Communications, including by
way of review of any electronic data, communications or other information, or
by seeking to have Parent or the Surviving Corporation waive the attorney-
client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that the Seller Parties
have the right to waive the attorney-client or other privilege or any
contractual or other right or claim of access or use, or (B) seek to obtain
the Parent Communications from DBCC Counsel.

shall be excluded and if the last day of such period is not a Business Day,
then the period shall end on the next succeeding Business Day; (m) any
