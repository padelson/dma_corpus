the conditions set forth herein.

 

C. As a condition and material inducement to the willingness of Purchaser to
enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the employees of Seller listed on _Exhibit A_ (the " _Key
Employees_ ") are executing and entering into certain employment arrangements
with Purchaser or its designee (the " _Employment Agreements_ ") and non-

D. As a condition and material inducement to the willingness of Purchaser to
enter into this Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller Parties and Purchaser
will execute and enter into the other Transaction Documents to which the

E. In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound

ARTICLE I

 

THE TRANSACTION

Section 1.1 _Purchased Assets_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in this Agreement, at the Closing, other than the Personal Property
set forth on  _Schedule 5.9(b)_, which will be transferred and assigned as
contemplated by _Section 5.9_ ( _Transition Services_ ), the Seller Parties
shall sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser or its
designees, and Purchaser and such designees shall acquire from the Seller
Parties, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances), all of the Seller Parties right, title and interest in and to
all of the following properties, assets and rights of any kind, whether
tangible or intangible, real or personal (collectively, the " _Purchased
Assets_ "):

(a) the Personal Property listed on _Schedule 1.1(a)_, and any services or
maintenance Contracts with the manufacturers of any such Personal Property and
any Software, programs and Databases used to operate such Personal Property;

 



1 (b) all Assigned Patents, Assigned Technology, and Assigned Trademarks;

 

(c) all copies of all books, files, papers, documentation and records (whether
in paper or electronic form) to the extent directly and primarily related to
the Purchased Assets and to the extent owned by, in the possession of, and
reasonably available to Seller Parties, including any tangible embodiments of
the Seller Licensed Intellectual Property that are delivered by Seller
to Purchaser pursuant to the License Agreement for Seller Licensed
Intellectual Property, but in each case excluding any Excluded Seller
Interconnect Technology and any tangible embodiments thereof, and subject to
Seller retaining (i) copies or originals of any of the same to the extent
they do not solely relate to the Purchased Assets, if and as Seller so
chooses, (ii) copies or originals of any of the same to the extent they solely
relate to the Purchased Assets and Seller is required by Applicable Law or
authorized in the Intellectual Property Agreement to retain such copies or
originals, (iii) copies or originals of any of the same identified on
_Schedule 1.1(c)_ or (iv) copies or originals of any of the same for which
Purchaser otherwise provides prior written consent for such retention; and

(d) the right to enforce all Intellectual Property Rights included in the
Purchased Assets and the right to sue (and seek and retain damages) for
infringement, misappropriation or other violation (including past
infringement, misappropriation or other violation) of such Intellectual
Property Rights.

Section 1.2 _Excluded Assets_. The Purchased Assets shall not include, and the
Seller Parties shall retain, all of the properties, assets and rights of any
kind, whether tangible or intangible, real or personal, of the Seller Parties
other than the Purchased Assets (collectively, the " _Excluded Assets_ "). 

Section 1.3 _No Assumed Liabilities_. Purchaser shall not assume or be deemed
to have assumed any Liabilities of Seller or its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor owner of all or part of Sellers or its Subsidiaries business or
assets), including those Liabilities that would become Liabilities of
Purchaser as a matter of Applicable Law in connection with this Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents and the Transactions.

Section 1.4 _Excluded Liabilities_. " _Excluded Liabilities_ " means any and
all Liabilities of Seller and its Subsidiaries, including the Seller Employee
Liabilities. The Seller Parties shall, and shall cause any successor to,
retain and be responsible for the Excluded Liabilities.

Section 1.5 _Consideration_.

(a) As consideration for the sale of the Purchased Assets and execution of the
Transaction Documents, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, in the manner described
herein, an amount (the " _Purchase Price_ ") equal to $140,000,000.

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay Seller the Purchase Price by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be specified in a
written notice delivered by Seller to Purchaser at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing.

Section 1.6 _Retention Bonus Pool_. Upon the Closing, Purchaser shall
establish (without requirement to segregate funds therefor) an employee
retention bonus pool for the Transferred Employees, with the general terms
and conditions set forth on _Exhibit B_ (the " _Retention Bonus Pool_ ").

 



2 Section 1.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Allocation_. The parties hereto intend that the purchase of the Purchased
Assets shall be treated as a taxable transaction for all applicable Tax
purposes, including for U.S. federal income tax and state income tax purposes.
Within ninety (90) days following the Closing, Purchaser and Seller and their
respective Affiliates shall agree upon the final allocation of consideration
payable pursuant to this Agreement among the Purchased Assets, which
allocation shall be in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). If Purchaser
and Seller are not able to agree on the Allocation within ninety (90) days
following the Closing, then the Allocation shall be determined by a nationally
recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller. The
Allocation shall be conclusive and binding upon Purchaser and Seller for all
purposes, and the parties agree that all Tax Returns (including Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form 8594) and all financial statements shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with (and the parties shall not otherwise
take a position on a Tax Return that is inconsistent with) the Allocation
unless required by the IRS or any other applicable Taxing Authority.

 

(b) _Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Person such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under any provision of U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. Tax Law or
under any applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the proper Taxing Authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

Section 1.8 _Non-Transferable Assets_.

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Purchased Asset is not assignable or
transferable (each, a " _Non-Transferable Asset_ ") without a Consent, and any
such Consent is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement
and the related instruments of transfer shall not constitute an assignment or
transfer of such Non-Transferable Asset, and Purchaser or its designee(s)
shall not assume the Seller Parties rights or obligations under such Non-
Transferable Asset (and such Non-Transferable Asset shall not be included in
the Purchased Assets), and instead the Seller Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any such Consent as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and, if such consent is
successfully obtained, the Seller Parties shall transfer and assign to
Purchaser such Non-Transferable Asset for no additional consideration.
Following any such assignment or transfer, all such Non-Transferable Assets
shall be deemed Purchased Assets for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) After the Closing, the Seller Parties shall, at Purchasers expense, use
commercially reasonable efforts (including making any necessary payments to
third parties or otherwise incurring expenses or costs) to provide Purchaser
or its designee(s) with all of the rights and benefits of any Non-
Transferable Assets after the Closing as if the appropriate Consent had been
obtained.

 



3 ARTICLE II

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER PARTIES

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure schedule attached hereto (each section of which (i) shall be deemed
to qualify any other section or subsection of this Article to which the matter
relates, so long as the applicability of such matter to such section is
readily apparent on its face and (ii) shall be deemed for all purposes to be
part of the representations and warranties made hereunder) (the " _Seller
Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Seller Parties hereby, upon the execution of
this Agreement and at Closing, represent and warrant to Purchaser as follows:

 

Section 2.1 _Organization_. Seller is a corporation duly organized and validly

Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each
other Transaction Document to which Seller or Canada Sub is or, at the
Closing, will become a party, and the consummation of the Transactions, have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of Seller or Canada Sub, as applicable. No other corporate proceedings on the
part of Seller or Canada Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement and
each other Transaction Document, or to consummate the Transactions. This
Agreement and each other Transaction Document to which Seller or Canada Sub
is or, at the Closing, will become a party have been or, at the Closing, will
be, as the case may be, duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller or
Canada Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the
other parties hereto and thereto, constitute or, with respect to any
Transaction Document to be executed at the Closing, will constitute the valid,
legal and binding obligations of Seller or Canada Sub, as applicable,
enforceable against Seller or Canada Sub, as applicable, in accordance with
their respective terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating
to creditors rights generally or to general principles of equity.

Section 2.3 _No Conflict; Required Consents and Approvals_. 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by Seller or Canada Sub of this
Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which Seller or Canada Sub
is or will be a party, and the consummation of the Transactions, do not and
will not: (i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or equivalent organizational documents of Seller or Canada Sub; (ii)
conflict with or violate any Applicable Law; (iii) result in any breach of, or
constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a breach of default) under, require any consent of or notice to
any Person pursuant to, or result in the creation of an Encumbrance (other
than Permitted Encumbrances) on any of the Purchased Assets pursuant to, any
Contract or Permit of Seller or Canada Sub, except, in each case, as would not
be material to the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets, and
except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Sellers
or Canada Subs ability to consummate the Transactions.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by Seller and Canada Sub of this
Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which Seller or Canada Sub
is or will be a party, and the consummation of the Transactions by Seller and
Canada Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Seller and Canada
Sub will not, require any consent, approval, authorization, clearance, or
permit of, or filing or registration with, or notification to,
any Governmental Entity for such performance, except for any filings required
to be made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") and under any other applicable antitrust,
competition, trade regulation or merger control Law (together with the HSR
Act, the " _Antitrust Laws_ ").

 



4 Section 2.4 _Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits_.

 

(a) Solely with respect to the Interconnect Program, (i) Seller and the
Related Subsidiaries are, and have been, in compliance with all Applicable
Laws in all material respects, (ii) neither Seller nor any Related Subsidiary
has received any written notice, Order, complaint or other communication that
either Seller or any Related Subsidiary have any material Liability under any
Applicable Law which has not been fully discharged or extinguished, or that
either Seller or any Related Subsidiary are not, or have not been, in material
compliance with any Applicable Law and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there is
no reasonable basis therefor, and (iii) neither Seller nor any Related
Subsidiary has received any written notice of, and, to the Knowledge of
Seller, there has not occurred, is not pending and is not threatened, any
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to either
Seller or any Related Subsidiary regarding a violation of any Applicable Law
by either Seller or any Related Subsidiary, which has subjected, or is
reasonably likely to subject, either Seller or any Related Subsidiary to any
material Liability and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there is no reasonable
basis therefor.

(b) Seller and each of the Related Subsidiaries are in possession of, and in
compliance with all material Permits necessary or appropriate for Seller and
the Related Subsidiaries to lawfully own, lease and operate the Purchased
Assets (the " _Seller Permits_ ") . Neither Seller nor any Related Subsidiary
has received any written notice of, and to the Knowledge of Seller, there has
not occurred, is not pending and is not threatened, any suspension,
cancellation, modification, revocation or nonrenewal of any Seller Permit
which has subjected, or is reasonably likely to subject, either Seller or any
Related Subsidiary to any material Liability and, to the Knowledge of Seller,
there is no reasonable basis therefor.

 

Section 2.5 Absence of Changes. Since January 1, 2012, except for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there has not been any event,
condition, circumstance, development, change or effect, that, individually or
in the aggregate, is, or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse
to the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or Seller
Licensed Intellectual Property.

Section 2.6 _Title_.

 

(a) The Seller Parties have good and valid title to, or in the case of leased
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, are the exclusive legal
owners of, and, subject to obtaining the consents set forth on _Section
2.6(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, have the unrestricted power and
right to sell, assign and deliver the Purchased Assets. No Subsidiary
of Seller other than Canada Sub has any right, title or interest in or to any
of the Purchased Assets or the Seller Licensed Intellectual Property.

(b) No licenses or Consents from any other Person are or will be necessary for
Purchaser to use any of the Purchased Assets or Seller Licensed Intellectual
Property in substantially the manner in which the Seller Parties have used
such Purchased Assets and Seller Licensed Intellectual Property prior to the
Closing, except for such licenses and Consents that if not obtained would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to
the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or Seller Licensed
Intellectual Property.

(c) The Purchased Assets are free and clear of all Encumbrances of any kind
or nature, except (i) Encumbrances disclosed in _Section 2.6(c)(i)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule which will be removed and released at or prior to
the Closing, and (ii) Permitted Encumbrances. Upon the Closing, Purchaser
will acquire good and valid title to or a valid leasehold interest in (as the
case may be) the Purchased Assets.

 



5 (d) Except for compliance with Applicable Law, upon the Closing, no
restrictions will exist on Purchasers right to sell, resell or license any
of the Purchased Assets, nor will any such restrictions be imposed on
Purchaser as a consequence of the Transactions, except, in each case, for such
restrictions that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or
Seller Licensed Intellectual Property.

Section 2.7 _Litigation._ Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice of, and there is not pending and, to the Knowledge
of Seller, is not threatened, any Action against Sellers or any Related
Subsidiarys interest in or use of any of the Purchased Assets or the Seller
Licensed Intellectual Property, or any Employee of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries in regards to their actions as such solely with respect to the
Interconnect Program, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there is no reasonable
basis for any such Action. No Action is pending or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened, seeking to prevent, hinder, modify, delay or challenge
the Transactions. Neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of, and to the Knowledge of Seller, there does not exist, any
outstanding Order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award
of, or pending or threatened investigation by, any Governmental Entity
against either Seller or Canada Sub relating to Sellers or any Related
Subsidiarys interest in or use of any of the Purchased Assets, the Seller
Licensed Intellectual Property, or any of the directors or officers of Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries in regards to their actions as such solely with
respect to the Interconnect Program, or the Transactions. There is no Action
related to the Purchased Assets or the Seller Licensed Intellectual Property
initiated by Seller or any Related Subsidiary pending, or which Seller or any
Related Subsidiary has commenced preparations to initiate, against any other
Person.

 

Section 2.8 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) _List of Employee Plans_. _Section 2.8(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth, as of the date hereof, a complete and correct list of all
Employee Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Employee Plan_ " means:

(i) all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")) and all
bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental
retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and
all employment, consulting, termination, severance or other contracts or
agreements with or covering (including eligibility to participate) any
Identified Employee to which Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates is a
party, with respect to which Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates has or
could have any obligation or Liability in respect of any Identified Employee
(or the dependent or beneficiary thereof) or which are maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates for the
benefit of any Identified Employee (or the dependent or beneficiary thereof);

(ii) each employee benefit plan for which Seller could incur Liability under
Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or were to be
terminated;

 

(iii) any plan in respect of which Seller could incur Liability under Section
4212(c) of ERISA; and

 

(iv) any Contracts between Seller and any Identified Employee, including any
Contracts relating in any way to a sale of Seller, the Interconnect Program
or the Purchased Assets.

(b) _Employee Plans Made Available_. Seller has made available to Purchaser a
complete and correct copy of each such Employee Plan (or, in the case of
Employee Plans that are subject

 



6  to ERISA and made available to employees of the Seller and its Subsidiaries
generally, summaries of the benefits provided under such plan) and, with
respect to each such Employee Plan, has made available to Purchaser, to the
extent applicable, a complete and correct copy of (i) the most recently
received IRS determination letter; (ii) the most recently prepared actuarial
report and financial statement; and (iii) all communications material to any
Identified Employee. Neither Seller nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has any
commitment (A) to create, incur material Liability with respect to, or cause
to exist any new employee benefit plan, program or arrangement that would be
considered, an Employee Plan or (B) to modify, change or terminate any
Employee Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or
termination required by Applicable Laws. Each Employee Plan is in writing
and maintained only in the U.S. and is subject only to the Laws of the U.S.
or a political subdivision thereof.

(c)  _Multiemployer, Title IV and Other Funded Plans_. Neither Seller nor
any ERISA Affiliate maintains, sponsors or contributes to, or has ever
maintained, sponsored or contributed to, a multiemployer plan within the
meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, a single employer pension
plan within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA for which Seller or
any of its ERISA Affiliates could incur Liability under Section 4063 or 4064
of ERISA, a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA), a plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code or a "funded welfare plan" within the meaning
of Section 419 of the Code, with respect to which Purchaser could have any
Liability.

(d) _Retiree Welfare and Change of Control Plans_. No Employee Plan provides
for or promises, or has ever provided for or promised, retiree medical,
disability or life insurance benefits to any Person, including any Identified
Employee or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, except as required by
Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or similar applicable
Law. Neither the execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents nor the consummation of the Transactions (either together with
or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) will
constitute an event under any Employee Plan or other Contract that will or may
reasonably be expected to result in any payment (including severance or
termination pay) or any acceleration, vesting, increase, funding (including
the segregation of assets to fund) or provision of benefits thereunder, in
each case, to any Identified Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof), whether or not any such payment or benefit would be an "excess
parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code).

(e)  _Compliance with Law_. Each Employee Plan is now and always has been
operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all Applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Seller and
each of its ERISA Affiliates have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it and Seller does not have any
Knowledge of any default or violation in any material respect by any other
party to any Employee Plan. There are no Actions or claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened in writing or reasonably anticipated or expected to be asserted
with respect to any Employee Plan or any related trust or other
funding medium thereunder.

(f) _Determination Letters_. Each Employee Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code, and
any related trust established in connection with such Employee Plan that is
intended to be exempt under 501(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination, advisory and/or opinion letter from the IRS, covering all of
the provisions applicable to the Employee Plan for which determination,
advisory and/or opinion letters are currently available, that the Employee
Plan is so qualified and the related trust is so tax exempt. To the Knowledge
of Seller, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination,
advisory and/or opinion letter or letters from the IRS that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee
Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

 



7 Section 2.9 _Labor and Employment Matters_.

 

(a) _List of Identified Employees_. _Section 2.9(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule lists each Identified Employee, including such Identified Employees

continuous service, base salary or wage rate, status as exempt or non-exempt,
and participation in commission, severance, incentive or bonus arrangements,
accrued but unused vacation and other paid leave; provided that, to the extent
applicable privacy or data protection Laws would prohibit the disclosure of
certain personally identifiable information without the individuals consent,
Seller shall specify such legal prohibition and may omit such information from
_Section 2.9(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. All of the Identified
Employees are employed solely by Seller, and none of the Identified Employees
has given written notice to Seller of his or her intention to go on leave of
absence or terminate his or her employment or services to Seller. All of the
Identified Employees are lawfully entitled to work or otherwise
provide services for Seller, including with respect to the Purchased Assets
and the Interconnect Program, without restriction or any visa, permit, export
license or consent being required.

 

(b) _At-Will Employment_. All of the Identified Employees are employed on an
at-will basis, which means that their employment can be terminated at any

2.9(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists each (i) Contract between
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and any Identified Employee that is not
terminable upon notice by Seller without cost or other Liability, and (ii)
obligation arising under any Applicable Law to provide notice prior to
termination and/or payment upon termination to any Identified Employee; in
either case except for wages or other benefits earned prior to the time of
termination.

(c) _Classification_. All Identified Employees are or were correctly
classified under all Applicable Laws by Seller as "employees" and at the
Closing Date, such individuals will qualify for such classification. All
Identified Employees are or were correctly classified under all Applicable
Laws by Seller, as exempt or non-exempt, as the case may be.

(d) _Compliance with Laws_. With respect to the Identified Employees : (i)
Seller and each of its Subsidiaries are and have at all times been in
compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws regarding labor

Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the
U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, the Workers Compensation Appeals Board, or any comparable body
outside the U.S., or any other Governmental Entity. There are no unresolved
disputes, grievances or other Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened between Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
Identified Employee, on the other hand and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there
is no reasonable basis therefor. The Seller does not have any Liability under
any Applicable Law related to employment or retention of any Identified
Employee and attributable to an event occurring or a state of facts existing
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(e) _Unions_. With respect to the Identified Employees : (i) neither Seller

collective bargaining agreement, shop agreement, works council agreement, or
similar labor union or collective agreement and no such agreement is presently

negotiation regarding a claim with any trade union or other body representing
employees or former employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv)

been engaged in any unfair labor practice (as defined under the National Labor
Relations Act or any other Applicable Law) of any nature; (v) no Employee is
or has ever been represented by any labor organization or otherwise covered
by any collective bargaining agreement, shop agreement, works council
agreement, or similar labor union or collective agreement in connection with
their employment by or service to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; and (vi)
there are and have been no activities or proceedings of any labor union or any
employee or group of employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to
organize any of the Employees. The Consent of, consultation of or the
rendering of formal advice by any labor or trade union, works council or any
other employee representative body is not required for Seller to enter into
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or to consummate any of the
Transactions.

 

(f) _WARN Act_. The Seller and its Subsidiaries are in full compliance with
the Worker Readjustment and Notification Act of 1988 (29 USC §2101), as
amended, or any applicable state laws or other Applicable Laws regarding
redundancies, reductions in force, mass layoffs, and plant closings, including
all obligations to promptly and correctly furnish all notices required to
be given thereunder in connection with any redundancy, reduction in force,
mass layoff, or plant closing to affected employees, representatives, any
state dislocated worker unit and local government officials, or any other
Governmental Authority (collectively, the " _WARN Act_ "). No reduction in
the notification period under the WARN Act is being relied upon by the Seller
or its Subsidiaries. Neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries has taken any action
that would constitute a plant closing or mass layoff within the meaning of,
or otherwise trigger notice, compensation, or other obligations under the WARN
Act. No restriction on restructuring exists with respect to the Identified
Employees.

 

Section 2.10 _Intellectual Property_.

(a) _Generally_.

(i) _Schedule 1.1(b)_ sets forth a complete and correct list of all Assigned
Patents, in each case listing, as applicable, (1) the name of the
applicant/registrant and current owner, (2) the jurisdiction where the
application/registration is located, (3) the application or registration
number, (4) the filing date and issuance/registration/grant date, and (5) the
prosecution status.

 

(ii) Each current or former employee, officer, director, consultant and
contractor of Seller or any Related Subsidiary who is or has been involved in
the creation, development, writing, invention, conception or discovery of the
Seller Intellectual Property has executed and delivered to Seller or the
relevant Related Subsidiary enforceable proprietary information,
confidentiality and assignment agreements that require each individual to
maintain in confidence all confidential or proprietary information (as defined
in such agreements) acquired by them in the course of their employment or
service and assign to Seller or such Related Subsidiary all Intellectual
Property Rights created, developed, written, invented, conceived or discovered
by such employees, officers, consultants or contractors, as applicable, in the
scope of such employment or service. There has been no disclosure by Seller
or any Related Subsidiary or any of its or their employees, officers,
directors, consultants, or contractors of any Trade Secrets included in the
Seller Interconnect Technology that would compromise the confidentiality of
such Trade Secrets or their status or protectibility under Applicable Law. In
each case in which Seller or any Related Subsidiary has acquired ownership (or
claimed or purported to acquire ownership) of any Seller Intellectual Property
from any Person, including any employee, officer, director, consultant and
contractor of Seller or any Related Subsidiary, Seller or the applicable
Related

 



9  Subsidiary has obtained a valid and enforceable assignment sufficient to
transfer ownership of and all rights (other than those not assignable under
Law) with respect to such Seller Intellectual Property to Seller or such
Related Subsidiary irrevocably. All assignments of Seller Intellectual
Property to Seller or any Related Subsidiary that are or may be required to be
filed or recorded in order to cause such assignment to be valid or effective
against bona fide purchasers without notice of such assignment have been duly
executed and filed or recorded with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or
the U.S. Copyright Office, as applicable, and any applicable Governmental
Entity elsewhere; _provided however_ that neither Seller nor Related
Subsidiary has registered Copyrights with the U.S. Copyright Office or any
other Governmental Entity, nor filed or recorded any assignments of such
unregistered Copyrights. 

(iii) Neither Seller nor any of the Related Subsidiaries do owe any
compensation or remuneration to a current or former employee, officer,
director, consultant or contractor in relation to any Seller Intellectual
Property (other than amounts owed as part of salaries for any such employees,
officers or directors), including with respect to any Patent in the
Seller Intellectual Property that is based on an invention of, or Copyright
in the Seller Intellectual Property that is based on a work of, any current or
former employee, officer, director, consultant or contractor of Seller or any
Related Subsidiary. There is no Patent, Copyright, or other Intellectual
Property Rights included in the Seller Intellectual Property that is owned,
exclusively licensed, or otherwise held by a current or former employee,
officer, director, consultant or contractor of Seller or any Related
Subsidiary.

(iv) All of the Assigned Patents are valid, subsisting, and enforceable (other
than pending applications thereof), and have not been abandoned or passed
into the public domain. Seller or one of the Related Subsidiaries, as
applicable, is the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title and interest
in and to all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Seller Assigned
Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of Seller, there are no facts,
circumstances, or information that would or reasonably could be expected to
render any of the Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Seller Assigned
Intellectual Property invalid or unenforceable. There are no facts,
circumstances or information (except for any facts, circumstances or
information that are particular to Purchaser, as to which Seller makes no
representation) that would or reasonably could be expected to adversely
affect, limit, restrict, impair, or impede the ability of Purchaser to use,
practice and otherwise exploit the Intellectual Property Rights embodied in
the Seller Intellectual Property upon the Closing in the same manner as
currently used, practiced and otherwise exploited by Seller and the Related
Subsidiaries. Neither Seller nor any of the Related Subsidiaries has received
any written notice or claim (a) challenging Sellers or any of the Related
Subsidiarys sole and exclusive ownership of any Seller Intellectual Property,
or (b) suggesting that any other Person has any claim of legal or beneficial
ownership with respect thereto or suggesting that any such Seller
Intellectual Property is invalid or unenforceable or otherwise challenging or
threatening such Seller Intellectual Property in any way.

(b) _Patents_. None of the Assigned Patents has been or is now involved in any
interference, reissue, reexamination or opposition proceeding in the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office or any corresponding office, department,
organization, agency or other Governmental Entity elsewhere, and to the
Knowledge of Seller, no such action has been threatened. None of the Assigned
Patents is subject to any compulsory license.

 

(c) _Copyrights_. Neither Seller nor any of the Related Subsidiaries has taken
any action or failed to take any action (including a failure to disclose
required information to the U.S. Copyright Office, or any corresponding
office, department, organization, agency or other Governmental Entity
elsewhere where applicable), or used or enforced (or failed to use or enforce)
any Copyrights included in the Seller Assigned Intellectual Property in a
manner that would result in (or reasonably be expected to result in) the
invalidity or unenforceability of any such Copyright, or that would result in
(or reasonably be expected to result in) such Copyright passing into the
public domain. Seller and the

 



10  Related Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable steps to protect their rights
in and to their Copyrights included in the Seller Assigned Intellectual
Property, _provided however_ that neither Seller nor any Related Subsidiary
has registered Copyrights with the U.S. Copyright Office or any other
Governmental Entity.

 

(d) _Trademarks_. To the Knowledge of Seller, there has been no prior use by
any third party of any Assigned Trademark that confers upon such third party
rights that are superior or senior to the rights of Seller or any Related
Subsidiary in such Assigned Trademark, or which could threaten the validity of
such Assigned Trademark, in any territory; _provided, however_ that neither
Seller nor any Related Subsidiary has registered any of the Assigned
Trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or any other Governmental
Entity.

(e) _Trade Secrets_. Seller and the Related Subsidiaries have taken necessary
and appropriate steps in accordance with generally-accepted industry standards
and Applicable Law, in any event no less than reasonable steps, to protect
their rights in, and to safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality
of, the information and materials that derive independent economic value,
actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other
persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use included in
the Seller Assigned Intellectual Property. Other than pursuant to a valid and
enforceable confidentiality agreement with respect thereto, neither
Seller nor any Related Subsidiary has authorized the disclosure of any Trade
Secret included in the Seller Assigned Intellectual Property, nor has any such
Trade Secret been disclosed.

 

(f) _Intellectual Property Agreements_.

(i) _Section 2.10(f)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list of all Inbound License Agreements indicating for
each the title, effective date, and parties thereto, other than licenses to
Seller or any Related Subsidiary of off-the-shelf Software that is
commercially available on reasonable terms to any Person for a license fee,
royalty or other consideration of no more than $5,000 per copy or user. 

(ii) _Section 2.10(f)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list of all Outbound License Agreements, indicating for
each the title, effective date, and parties thereto, other than for (A) non-
exclusive licenses for Seller Interconnect Technology granted to customers of
Seller or any Related Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business and (B)
stand-alone non-disclosure agreements that do no more than grant to third
parties limited scope and use rights with respect to the Trade Secrets in the
Seller Assigned Intellectual Property for the limited purposes set forth
therein and which do not allocate rights materially different than in Sellers
standard form of non-disclosure agreement.

(iii) There is no outstanding dispute or disagreement threatened in writing,
or, to the Knowledge of Seller, otherwise threatened, with respect to any
Inbound License Agreements or Outbound License Agreements (together, the "
_Seller License Agreements_ "). Complete and correct copies of all Seller
License Agreements have been made available to Purchaser. Neither Seller nor,
to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party to any Seller License Agreement
is in breach or default of such Seller License Agreement.

(iv) There is no Contract, judicial decree, arbitral award or other judgment
or requirement made against Seller or any Related Subsidiary that obligates
Seller or any Related Subsidiary or Purchaser or its Affiliates to grant
licenses in the future with respect to any Seller Assigned Intellectual
Property.

 



11 (v) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, will violate or result in the breach, material
modification, cancellation, termination or suspension of, or expansion or
transfer of any Intellectual Property Rights under, any Seller License
Agreement (or give rise to any right with respect to any of the foregoing).

(vi) Except as a result of any Contracts, duties or obligations that
Purchaser or its Affiliates are subject to prior to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement nor the Transaction Documents, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor any
Contract to which Seller or any Related Subsidiary is a party or otherwise
bound, will cause or require (or purports to cause or require) Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates to (i) grant to any other Person any license, covenant
not to sue, immunity or other right with respect to or under any Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Rights owned by Purchaser or
Affiliates independent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(ii) be obligated to pay any royalties or other amounts, or offer any
discounts, to any other Person.

(vii) Seller or one of the Related Subsidiaries, as applicable, solely and
exclusively owns all right, title and interest in and to (including the sole
right to enforce) all items listed on  _Schedule 1.1(b)_ and all Seller
Intellectual Property purported to be owned by Seller or any of the Related
Subsidiaries, and none of the foregoing has been exclusively licensed to any
Person. Seller or one of the Related Subsidiaries, as applicable, is listed
in the records of the appropriate Governmental Entity as the sole owner of
each of the Assigned Patents.

 

(g) _Seller Mask Works_. _Section 2.10(g)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a complete and accurate list of each Seller Mask Work.

(h) _No Infringement by Seller_. The Seller Intellectual Property, as
currently used, imported, made distributed or sold by Seller or any Related
Subsidiary (i) does not infringe, misappropriate, dilute, use or disclose
without authorization, or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights
of any third party, and (ii) does not constitute unfair competition or trade
practices under the Laws of any relevant jurisdiction; provided, however, that
with respect to Seller Licensed Intellectual Property only, the foregoing
representation is given to the Seller Parties Knowledge as to third party
patent rights. No Action has been initiated or is pending, and no written
notice of any Action has been received by Seller or any Related Subsidiary,
alleging that Seller or any Related Subsidiary, or any Seller Interconnect
Technology or Seller Assigned Intellectual Property has infringed,
misappropriated, diluted, used or disclosed without authorization, or
otherwise violated the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party or
constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the Laws of any
relevant jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Seller nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received any correspondence asking or inviting Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into a Patent or other Intellectual
Property Right license or similar agreement, to pay for or obtain a release
for Patent or other Intellectual Property Right infringement, or otherwise to
enter into other arrangements with respect to the Patents or other
Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person relating to the Seller
Intellectual Property.

(i) _No Orders_. No Seller Intellectual Property is subject to any
outstanding Order, judgment, injunction, decree, or stipulation against Seller
or any Related Subsidiary restricting the use, practice, sale, transfer,
licensing or exploitation thereof by Seller or any Related Subsidiary.

(j) _No Infringement by Third Parties_. During the past three (3) years,
neither Seller nor any Related Subsidiary has instituted, asserted or
threatened any Action against any third party with respect to infringement,
misappropriation, dilution, use or disclosure without authorization, or
other 

 



12  violation of any Seller Assigned Intellectual Property, nor has Seller or
any Related Subsidiary issued any written communication inviting any third
party to take a license, authorization, covenant not to sue or the like with
respect to any Seller Assigned Intellectual Property (other than in connection
with licenses granted by Seller or any Related Subsidiary in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and not related to any
infringement or other violation by the licensee or potential licensee).

(k) _Software_.  _Section 2.10(k)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists
all of the Software included in the Seller Interconnect Technology.

(l) _Open Source and Related Matters_. _Section 2.10(l)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of all Open Source
Technology that is incorporated into, integrated or bundled with, linked with
or otherwise used in any Seller Interconnect Technology. None of the Seller
Software is used with Open Source Technology in a manner that would require as
a condition of use, modification, hosting, and/or distribution of such Seller
Software that such Seller Software (A) be disclosed or distributed in source
code form, (B) be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works, (C) be
redistributed, hosted or otherwise made available at no or minimal charge, or
(D) be licensed, sold or otherwise made available on terms that (1) limit in
any manner the ability to charge license fees or otherwise seek compensation
in connection with the marketing, licensing or distribution of such Seller
Software or (2) grant the right to decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or
otherwise derive the source code or underlying structure of such Seller
Software. Seller and the Related Subsidiaries have taken sufficient steps,
including by implementing and enforcing appropriate policies in accordance
with industry standards, to identify Open Source Technology used in the Seller
Interconnect Technology by Seller or any Related Subsidiary.

 

(m) _Status of Existing Products_. The Aries Seller Interconnect is currently
in the late stages of development (verification and testing). The Pisces
Seller Interconnect is in the early stages of development (development of
functional specifications). The Seller has no Knowledge of any technological
issues that would prevent general availability of the Aries
Seller Interconnect or the Pisces Seller Interconnect after further
development. _Section 2.10(m)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule identifies
the material bugs and errors on Sellers current working bug list for the
Aries Seller Interconnect. Seller has employed commercially reasonable
procedures and practices related to identifying and recording material bugs in
the development of the Aries Seller Interconnect.

 

(n) _Documentation_. Seller and the Related Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
actions to document the Seller Interconnect Technology and the operation
thereof, such that the Intellectual Property and other materials comprising
such technology, including the source code and documentation for any Software
incorporated therein or used in connection therewith, have been written in a
manner such that they may be understood, modified and maintained by the
Transferred Employees and other reasonably competent programmers (or other
applicable personnel) whose experience is reasonably commensurate with that of
the Identified Employees.

(o) _Standards-Setting Organizations, SIGs, Consortia_. _Section 2.10(o)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a list of each standards setting
organization, university or industry body, consortium, other multi-party
special interest group and any other collaborative or other group in which
Seller or any Related Subsidiary is currently participating, or in which
Seller or any Related Subsidiary has participated in the past or applied for
future participation in, including any of the foregoing that may be organized,
funded, sponsored, formed or operated, in whole or in part, by any
Governmental Entity (each, a " _SIG_ ") relating to the Seller Interconnect
Technology. Neither Seller nor any Related Subsidiary is bound by, or has
agreed to be bound by, any Contract, bylaws, policy, or rule of any such
listed SIG or working group or other division thereof other than those
Contracts, bylaws, policies, and rule that all participants in such listed SIG
are required to agree to.

 



13 (p) _Contaminants_. The Software included in the Seller Interconnect
Technology is substantially free of any material defects, bugs and errors
that cannot be resolved in the ordinary course of maintenance of such
Software, and does not contain or make available any disabling codes or
instructions, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, trap doors, backdoors, Easter
eggs, logic bombs, time bombs, cancelbots, viruses and other software or
programming routines that permit or cause (or are suspected or known to permit
or cause) unauthorized access to, or disruption, modification, recordation,
misuse, transmission, impairment, disablement, or destruction of, Software,
data, systems or other materials.

 

(q) _Government Contracts_.

(i) _Section 2.10(q)(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains a list of
each Contract providing for the development of Seller Intellectual Property,
including Seller Software, at the full or partial expense of a Governmental

whatsoever under the CNDA with respect to such Trade Secrets; and (iii) with
respect to such Trade Secrets, the Seller Parties obligations pursuant to the
CNDA shall apply (except to the extent such obligations are modified or
superseded by, or otherwise inconsistent with, the provisions of the
Intellectual Property Agreement or any other Transaction Document) until such
Trade Secrets become publicly known other than through negligence or any other
wrongful act or omission of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

Section 5.2 _Public Announcements_. Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall issue
any press release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to the
Transactions without the prior written consent of the other party, except as
such release or statement may be required by Applicable Law, including the
rules or regulations of any U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange, in which
case each of Seller and Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance and will consider in good faith the
advice of such other party with respect thereto.

 



23 Section 5.3 _Employees and Contractors._

 

(a) _Section 2.9(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
those Employees, as mutually agreed between Seller and Purchaser, to whom
Purchaser may elect to offer employment following the Closing with Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Identified Employees_ "). Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to have such designees enter into
compensation profiles and/or offers with Purchaser or a Subsidiary thereof
(each, a " _Purchaser Employer_ "), as soon as practicable after the date
hereof and in any event prior to the Closing Date, which
compensation profiles and/or offers shall become effective upon the Closing
and shall provide terms and conditions deemed by Purchaser to be reasonably
attractive to the Identified Employees. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to make
an offer of employment to any employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries.
Effective no later than immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall
terminate, at its own expense, the employment of each of those Identified
Employees who has received but not accepted an offer of employment with
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall have no obligation to terminate the
employment of any Identified Employee who has not received an offer of
employment from a Purchaser Employer prior to the Closing Date and Seller may,
in its sole discretion, continue to employ any such Identified Employee.
Identified Employees who accept compensation profiles and/or offers of
employment from a Purchaser Employer shall be entitled to the benefits and
such other terms and conditions of employment described in their respective
compensation profiles and/or offers as the case may be, as determined in the
sole discretion of Purchaser; provided that Transferred Employees will
generally be eligible to participate in the employee benefit and compensation
plans of the applicable Purchaser Employer that are generally available to
similarly situated employees of the Purchaser Employer, and in accordance
with the terms of such plans from time to time with credit given for years of
service at Seller for select programs in accordance with Purchasers standard
human resources policies and practices and consistent with past practice.

(b) The timing and content of any announcement or notification to the
Identified Employees with respect to the Transactions (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include any press release or other public
statement (which are separately addressed in _Section 5.2_ ( _Public
Announcements_ )) or any compensation profiles and/or offers of employment or
independent contractor agreements or related communications to the Identified
Employees) shall be subject to the approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, of each of Purchaser and Seller. Seller will consult with Purchaser
(and will consider in good faith the advice of Purchaser) prior to sending any
notices or other communication materials relating to the Transactions to
employees or independent contractors of Seller and its Subsidiaries.

(c) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall
notify the Identified Employees that all claims for expenses which qualify
for coverage under the terms of the Employee Plans and which are incurred on
or prior to the Closing Date must be submitted within the time limit provided
by the Employee Plans and no later than five (5) days after the Closing Date.

(d) Seller shall, at its own expense, give all notices and other information
required to be given to the Identified Employees, any labor or trade union,
works council or any other employee representative body, and any applicable
Governmental Entity under the WARN Act, the National Labor Relations Act, as
amended, the Code, COBRA and other Applicable Laws in connection with the
execution of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the
consummation of the Transactions. Neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries will
take any action prior to the Closing that would or could reasonably be
expected to constitute a plant closing or mass layoff within the meaning of,
or otherwise trigger notice, compensation, or other obligations under the WARN
Act.

 



24 Section 5.4 _Tax Matters._

 

(a) _Property Taxes_. All real property taxes, personal property taxes and
similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets ("
_Property Taxes_ ") for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date shall be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser as of the
Closing Date based on the number of days of such taxable period included in
the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days of such taxable period
included in the Post-Closing Tax Period. Following the Closing, Seller shall
be liable for the proportionate amount of such Property Taxes that
is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Purchaser shall be liable
for the proportionate amount of such Property Taxes that is attributable to
the Post-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall notify Purchaser upon receipt of any
bill for such Property Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets, part or all of
which are attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period, and shall promptly
deliver such bill to Purchaser who shall pay the same to the appropriate
Taxing Authority; provided, that if such bill covers any part of the Pre-
Closing Tax Period, Seller shall also remit prior to the due date of such
Property Taxes to Purchaser payment for the proportionate amount of such bill
that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. In the event that either
Seller or Purchaser shall thereafter provide the other party with evidence of
having made a payment for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this
subsection, the other party shall make such reimbursement promptly, but in
no event later than thirty (30) days after the presentation of a statement
setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the presenting party is
entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the amount of reimbursement.

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Seller shall be responsible for and shall pay when due
any U.S. federal or state or Canadian federal, provincial or territorial
Transfer Taxes imposed on the transfer, pursuant to this Agreement, of the
Purchased Assets which are located in the U.S. or Canada. Seller shall provide
Purchaser with reasonable proof of payment. The parties hereto shall
cooperate, to the extent reasonably requested and as permitted by Applicable
Law, in minimizing any such Transfer Taxes. Purchaser agrees to accept by
electronic transfer or transfer in another manner reasonably calculated
and legally permitted to minimize or avoid the incurrence of Transfer Taxes,
all intangible property included within the Purchased Assets. The party
required by Applicable Law to file a Tax Return with respect to such Transfer
Taxes shall do so within the time period prescribed by Applicable Law, and
Seller shall promptly remit to Purchaser the amount of any Transfer Taxes for
which it is responsible pursuant to this _Section 5.4(b)_ so payable by
Purchaser upon receipt of notice that such Transfer Taxes are payable. In the
event that Purchaser shall make a payment for which it is entitled to
reimbursement under this subsection, Seller shall make such reimbursement
promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the presentation
of a statement setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which Purchaser is
entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the amount of reimbursement.

 

(c) _Responsibility for Payment of Taxes_. Taxes attributable to the Purchased
Assets and Seller Licensed Intellectual Property other than those treated
specifically in subsections (a) and (b) above, shall be borne by Seller with
respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and by the Purchaser with respect to the
Post-Closing Tax Period as if the taxable year of Seller ended on the Closing
Date.

(d) _Cooperation in Tax Matters_. The parties hereto agree to furnish or cause
to be furnished to one another, upon request, as promptly as practicable,
such information and assistance relating to the Purchased Assets or Seller
Licensed Intellectual Property as is reasonably necessary for the filing of
all Tax Returns, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and
the prosecution or defense of any claim or proceeding relating to any Tax
Return. In the event any Taxing Authority informs Seller or Purchaser of any
notice of proposed audit, claim, assessment or other dispute concerning an
amount of Taxes related to the Purchased Assets or Seller Licensed
Intellectual Property with respect to which the other party may incur
Liability hereunder, the party so informed shall promptly 

 



25  notify the other party of such matter; provided that, failure to promptly
notify shall not reduce the other partys indemnity obligation hereunder,
except to the extent such partys ability to defend against such matter is
actually prejudiced thereby; and provided further, that resolution of such
audit, claim, assessment or other dispute shall be governed by _Section 8.3_
( _Third Party Actions_ ).

 

Section 5.5 _Further Actions._

(a) At any time or from time to time after the Closing, at the other partys
request, at no cost to the requesting party and without further consideration,
each of Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to (i) execute and deliver to the other party such other
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation,
provide such materials and information and take such other actions as
the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to
effectively transfer, convey and assign to Purchaser, and to confirm
Purchasers title to, all of the Purchased Assets, free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law or
contract, to put Purchaser in actual possession and operating control of the
Purchased Assets, and to cause the parties to fulfill their respective
obligations under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents; and (ii)
cooperate with the other party to contest or defend against any Action
relating to the Transactions.

 

(b) If after the Closing, either Purchaser or Seller in good faith identifies
any asset of Seller or its Subsidiaries properly transferrable as a Purchased
Asset that was not included in the Purchased Assets transferred at the Closing
(any such asset, a " _Later Identified Asset_ "), then either Purchaser or
Seller, as applicable, will provide written notice to the other party
identifying such Later Identified Asset and Seller will, or will cause its
Subsidiaries to, as promptly as practicable after written notice by Purchaser,
transfer, convey, assign, deliver, or cause to be transferred,
conveyed, assigned, or delivered to Purchaser, all right, title and interest
of Seller and its Subsidiaries in and to such Later Identified Asset which is
transferable, and such Later Identified Assets shall be deemed to be Purchased
Assets for purposes of this Agreement and any applicable Transaction
Document, effective as of the date of transfer, conveyance, assignment, or
delivery. If within thirty (30) days after the Closing, Seller specifically
identifies in writing to Purchaser an Excluded Asset that was transferred,
conveyed, assigned, or delivered inadvertently by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, then Purchaser will as promptly as
practicable after written notice by Seller, transfer, convey, assign,
or deliver back to Seller all such transferred right, title and interest of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries in and to such Excluded Asset which is
transferable.

(c) To the extent that Purchaser cannot be granted physical possession of any
Purchased Asset as of the Closing Date, such Purchased Asset shall be held by
the Seller Parties for and on behalf of Purchaser until such time as
Purchaser is able to take possession thereof.

Section 5.6 _Seller Intellectual Property._

(a) Unless specifically permitted in the Transaction Documents, Seller agrees
that, from and after the Closing Date, it shall not, and it shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives not to, retain (other than as
retained through automated retention or backup processes) or use any copy of
any of the Seller Assigned Intellectual Property. Without limitation of
_Section 5.5_ ( _Further Actions_ ), if any of the Seller Parties (or any
assignee or successor of the Seller Parties) retains any right or interest in
any Seller Assigned Intellectual Property that cannot be, or for any reason
is not, assigned to Purchaser at the Closing, each of the Seller Parties
hereby grants, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns (and agrees
to so grant or cause to be so granted) to Purchaser, effective as of the
Closing, a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free and fully paid-up,
transferable, sublicensable (through multiple levels), exclusive, worldwide
right and license to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform 

 



26  (whether publicly or otherwise), prepare derivative works of and otherwise
modify, make, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise use and exploit, and
exercise and practice all rights under, all or any portion of such Seller
Assigned Intellectual Property.

(b) If Purchaser is unable to enforce any of the Seller Assigned Intellectual
Property against a third party as a result of any Applicable Law that
prohibits enforcement of such rights by a transferee of such rights, at
Purchasers request and subject to the applicable Seller Partys
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) the Seller Party shall
initiate or join proceedings against such third party. Purchaser shall control
such proceedings and shall be responsible for the costs and expenses of such
proceedings (including the Seller Partys reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred in participating in such proceedings at Purchasers request).

(c) Without limitation of _Section 5.5_ ( _Further Actions_ ), to the extent
any disclosures, elections, and/or notices are required by applicable
regulations and contract terms to protect ownership of inventions developed,
conceived or first actually reduced to practice under Government Contracts
related to the Assigned Patents or Assigned Technology (including where the
creation of the invention was in progress at the time of the Closing but
where the initial disclosures, elections, and/or notices were not yet
required), Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to timely execute
and deliver such disclosures, elections and/or notices as may be required to
protect Purchasers interest in the Assigned Patents and Assigned Technology.

Section 5.7 _Records and Documents_. For a period of six (6) years after the
Closing, at Purchasers request, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide, at Purchasers expense, Purchaser and its
Representatives with access to and the right to make copies of those records
and documents related to the Purchased Assets, the possession of which is
retained by Seller or its Subsidiaries as may be necessary or useful in
connection with Purchasers ownership and use of the Purchased Assets after
the Closing, subject to and except as may be prohibited by any applicable
confidentiality obligations pertaining to proprietary information of any other
Person that is contained or embodied in such records or documents. If during
such period Seller or any of its Subsidiaries elects to dispose of such
records and documents, Seller shall give Purchaser sixty (60) days prior
written notice, during which period Purchaser shall have the right to take
such records and documents without further consideration.

Section 5.8 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation._

 

(a) From and after the date hereof and until the earlier of three (3) years
after the Closing and the lapsing pursuant to Section 1.7(b) of the
Intellectual Property Agreement of the noncompete and other exclusions,
limitations and restrictions of the licenses granted to Seller under the
Intellectual Property Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates shall
not, directly or indirectly, whether on such Persons own behalf or on behalf
of some other Person (i) acquire an ownership interest in, sponsor, organize,
or invest in, or attempt to do any of the foregoing, any Person that
commercializes or sells Interconnect Products on a stand-alone or
substantially stand-alone basis (except for the purpose of modifying or
optimizing an Interconnect Product, or developing, modifying or optimizing a
commercial product other than an Interconnect Product, in each case if such
product is exclusively acquired by Seller or its Affiliates and is not
commercialized by Seller or its Affiliates in a manner that would otherwise
violate this _Section 5.8(a)_); (ii) commercialize or sell Interconnect
Products on a stand-alone or substantially stand-alone basis, except as
authorized by the Transaction Documents; (iii) commercialize or sell
Interconnect Products (not on a stand-alone or substantially stand-alone
basis) that are primarily developed by Seller or its Affiliates except as
authorized by the Transaction Documents; (iv) disparage or make any false
statements (whether in oral, written, electronic or other form) to any media
source, industry member-company or group, financial institution or actual or
prospective customer for products

 



27  containing Seller Interconnect Technology regarding Purchaser or its
Affiliates in connection with the Interconnect Program or Seller Interconnect
Technology; provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller and its
Affiliates from, collectively, owning as a passive investment ten percent
(10%) or less of the equity of any publicly-traded entity. For purposes of the
foregoing, a Person who is not a customer for products containing Seller
Interconnect Technology shall be considered a "prospective customer" if, to
the Knowledge of Seller, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries made a presentation
or written proposal to such Person primarily related to products containing
Seller Interconnect Technology during the twenty-four (24) month period
preceding the date hereof or was preparing to make such a presentation or
proposal on the date hereof.

 

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the date that is one (1) year after
the Closing Date, Seller and its Subsidiaries will not directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, solicit any
Transferred Employee for employment by Seller or its Subsidiaries; _provided_
, _however_ , that Seller and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to solicit
for employment, engage as a consultant or otherwise recruit Identified
Employees who are not offered employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates prior
to the Closing Date or who at any time are no longer employed by Purchaser or
its Affiliates as a result of termination by Purchaser or its Affiliates and
any such employees who are contacted as a result of the use of general
newspaper or online advertisement and other general non-targeted recruitment
techniques in the ordinary course of business, as opposed to targeted
solicitations of any one or more of such Transferred Employees. From the date
of this Agreement until the date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date,
Purchasers Communications and Networking Group will not directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Seller, solicit any employee
of Seller that is not a Transferred Employee for employment by Purchasers
Communications and Networking Group; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Purchasers Communications and Networking Group will be permitted to
solicit for employment any such employees who are contacted as a result of the
use of general newspaper or online advertisement and other general non-
targeted recruitment techniques in the ordinary course of business, as
opposed to targeted solicitations of any one or more of such employee of
Seller that is not a Transferred Employee.

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of
this Section would be inadequate and that, in addition to any other remedies
available, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the event of any such breach.

 

Section 5.9 _Transition Services_.

(a) Purchaser will notify Seller if, prior to the Closing, Purchaser
reasonably determines that it may require additional Transition Services to be
provided by Seller in addition to those already to be provided under the
terms of the Transition Services Agreement. This notice will include (a) a
description of such additional Transition Services and any terms upon which
these services are to be provided, including the cost to be paid by
the Purchaser, if any, and (b) a correspondingly revised set of schedules to
the Transition Services Agreement to replace the schedules included in the
form of Transition Services Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit D_. The
revised schedules to the Transition Services Agreement will be subject to
Sellers approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(b) The Personal Property listed on _Schedule 5.9(b)_ will be retained by
Seller until the termination or expiration of the Post-Production Phase (as
such term is defined in the Transition Services Agreement), at which time,
Seller shall transfer and assign such Personal Property to Purchaser or its
designee for no additional consideration.

 



28 Section 5.10 _Security Clearances_. Subject to the limitations of Applicable
Laws,  _Schedule 5.10_ sets forth a complete list of all Identified
Employees that, to the Knowledge of Seller, hold security clearances granted
by any Governmental Entity, indicating the type of security clearance held by
such Identified Employee. Consistent with the requirements set forth in the
National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, DOD 5220.22-M, and any
supplements, amendments or revised editions thereof, the parties will
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts for such Identified
Employees that are Transferred Employees to retain their respective security
clearances.

 

Section 5.11 _Aries Commercial Availability_. From and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly, sell, lease, license or otherwise make commercially available,
Aries to any Person, other than Seller and its Subsidiaries, without the prior
written consent of Seller (in its sole discretion). For the purpose of
this Section, "Aries" shall mean the original general availability version of
the integrated circuit known by the Seller code name "Aries" and any (i) re-
spin thereof or (ii) modified or improved version thereof to the extent the
modifications and improvements are not, in the aggregate, substantial.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Aries technology integrated
into, or packaged with, a Purchaser processor (that itself is not a stand-
alone interconnect) be considered "Aries" for the purpose of this Section.

Section 5.12 _Software Escrow Deposit_. Pursuant to the Software Escrow
Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, Seller shall deposit in escrow a full,
complete and functional copy of the following (including any Seller
Interconnect Technology and Third Party Aries/Pisces Technology contained
therein): (i) the Verilog RTL code for the Aries and Pisces Seller
Interconnects, and (ii) any documentation, libraries, tools, utilities and
other related materials reasonably necessary for the installation,
testing, deployment, operation, modification or use of such Verilog RTL code
that are not otherwise delivered to Purchaser or its designee on or before
Closing (collectively, " _Technology Deposit Materials_ ") with Iron Mountain
Incorporated (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). The Technology Deposit Materials shall
be released to Purchaser as set forth in the Software Escrow Agreement. The
Software Escrow Agreement shall terminate as set forth in the Software Escrow
Agreement, including upon written notice from Purchaser to the Escrow Agent
or upon Purchasers receipt of all such Technology Deposit Materials. All fees
and expenses payable to the Escrow Agent for the establishment and maintenance
of such escrow arrangement shall be borne and paid by Purchaser.

Section 5.13 _Post-Closing Delivery of Seller Proprietary Aries/Pisces
Technology_. No later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, subject to
Purchasers provision of services as required in Section 1(a)(iii) of Schedule
B-2.1 of the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
or its designees the Seller Interconnect Technology included within the
Technology Deposit Materials (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any Third
Party Aries/Pisces Technology) (the " _Seller Proprietary
Aries/Pisces Technology_ "), in the manner and form, and to the locations,
reasonably specified by Purchaser or its designees.

 

Section 5.14 _Jointly-Owned Patents_. From and after the Closing, Seller
agrees to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser for Purchaser to enter into an
agreement with Stanford University for the joint ownership by Stanford
University and Purchaser of certain Patents included in the Purchased Assets
and, upon written notice from Purchaser, Seller will use its
reasonable efforts to terminate the Agreement between Seller and the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, dated as of June 16, 2008,
with respect to such jointly-owned Patents.

arising out of, relating to, or imposed upon or incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnitee by reason of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Seller Parties contained in _Article II_ of this Agreement ( _provided_ that

in this Agreement;

(iii) any and all Excluded Liabilities;

(iv) any noncompliance with applicable bulk sales or fraudulent transfer Laws
in connection with the Transactions;

amounts owing to the Identified Employees as result of their separation from

_General; Survival_ ) and the other provisions of this Article, from and
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors and employees

upon or incurred by any Seller Indemnitee by reason of:

 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser

materiality);

(ii) any breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement; and 

(iii) the ownership, use or operation of the Purchased Assets by Purchaser or
its Affiliates from and after the Closing Date.

(c) _Limitations_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (A) no
Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses
arising solely from a claim for indemnification pursuant to subsection (a)(i)
above until the aggregate amount of all Losses under all claims of all
Purchaser Indemnitees for all such breaches exceeds $1,400,000 (the " _Basket_
"), at which time all Losses incurred shall be subject to indemnification
hereunder (subject to subsection (c)(ii) below) including the amount of the
Basket; and (B) Sellers aggregate Liability for indemnification pursuant to

 



34  subsection (a)(i) above shall not exceed $17,500,000; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth above in this
subsection shall not apply with respect to any claim for indemnification
based on (1) fraud or intentional misrepresentation, for which Sellers
Liability for indemnification is not limited, (2) any inaccuracy in or breach
of any Fundamental Representation, for which Sellers Liability for
indemnification pursuant to subsections (a)(ii) through (a)(vi), together with
any Liability otherwise pursuant to subsection (a)(i), in the aggregate, shall
not exceed the Purchase Price, and (3) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
Extended Representation, for which Sellers Liability for indemnification,
together with any Liability otherwise pursuant to subsection (a)(i), in the
aggregate, shall not exceed $29,750,000.

 

(ii) Sellers Liability for indemnification pursuant to subsections (a)(i)
through (vi), in the aggregate, shall not exceed the Purchase Price, unless
the claim is of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, in which case it is
not limited.

(iii) A Purchaser Indemnitees right to indemnification under this Article
based on any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty shall
not be diminished or otherwise affected in any way as a result of such
Purchaser Indemnitees knowledge of such inaccuracy, breach or untruth as of
the date hereof or as of Closing, regardless of whether such knowledge exists
as a result of the Purchaser Indemnitees investigation or as a result of
disclosure by Seller or any of its Affiliates, unless such disclosures were
set forth in this Agreement or in all applicable Schedules hereto.

(iv) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this Article shall be net of the amounts of any insurance proceeds which an
Indemnitee actually receives with respect to any such Losses (net of cost of
recovery, deductibles and premium increases). For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall Seller have any Liability to any Purchaser Indemnitee for the
same Losses under more than one provision of this Article.

 

(v) Each party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any of its Losses,
including evaluation of any insurance policies and other collateral sources
that would reasonably be applicable to such Loss.

(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller and its
Affiliates shall not be responsible for, or have an indemnification obligation
with respect to, any Taxes (other than those allocated or attributable to
Seller and its Affiliates in _Section 5.4(a)_,  _Section 5.4(b)_ and
_Section 5.4(c)_) imposed on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates arising from
or attributable to Purchasers use or ownership of the Purchased Assets or
Seller Licensed Intellectual Property in a Post-Closing Tax Period.

Section 8.3 _Third Party Actions_.

 

(a) If any Purchaser Indemnitee is made party to a third party Action that
Purchaser believes, in good faith, may result in a claim of indemnification
for a Purchaser Indemnitee under this Article (a " _Purchaser Indemnification
Claim_ "), Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of such Action, shall
conduct the defense of any such Action with respect to Purchaser or such
other Purchaser Indemnitee and its or their respective rights and shall, to
the extent reasonably requested by Seller from time to time, give updates as
to the status of such Action. Seller shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any such Action with respect to Seller and its rights at Sellers
sole cost and expense. Purchaser shall seek the prior written consent of
Seller (which consent may be withheld, conditioned or delayed by Seller in its
sole discretion) in connection with Purchasers agreement to any settlement
or compromise of any such third party Action. Any such written consent by
Seller shall represent the agreement of Seller that the Losses incurred in
connection therewith shall be indemnifiable hereunder. In

 



35  the event that Purchaser shall fail to obtain such written consent of
Seller, Purchaser may agree to any such settlement or compromise, and may make
a Purchaser Indemnification Claim therefor, but the resolution of such claim
(including whether and to what extent Purchaser or any other Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement for such Purchaser
Indemnification Claim) shall remain subject to this Article.

 

(b) If any Seller Indemnitee is made party to a third party Action that Seller
believes, in good faith, may result in a claim of indemnification for a
Seller Indemnitee under this Article (a " _Seller Indemnification Claim_ "),
Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of such Action, shall conduct the
defense of any such Action with respect to Seller or such other Seller
Indemnitee and its or their respective rights and shall, to the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser from time to time, give updates as to the
status of such Action. Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any such Action with respect to Purchaser and its rights at
Purchasers sole cost and expense. Seller shall seek the prior written consent
of Purchaser (which consent may be withheld, conditioned or delayed by
Purchaser in its sole discretion) in connection with Sellers agreement to
any settlement or compromise of any such third party Action. Any such written
consent by Purchaser shall represent the agreement of Purchaser that the
Losses incurred in connection therewith shall be indemnifiable hereunder. In
the event that Seller shall fail to obtain such written consent of Purchaser,
Seller may agree to any such settlement or compromise, and may make a Seller
Indemnification Claim therefor, but the resolution of such claim (including
whether and to what extent Seller or any other Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement for such Seller Indemnification Claim)
shall remain subject to this Article.

 

Section 8.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) In the event that an Indemnitee seeks a recovery in accordance with the
terms of this Article, in respect of a Purchaser Indemnification Claim or
Seller Indemnification Claim (as applicable, an " _Indemnification Claim_ "),
Purchaser (on behalf of such other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or
Seller (on behalf of such other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable) shall
deliver a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to Seller or Purchaser (such
party obligated to provide indemnification under this Article, the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), as the case may be. Each Claim Notice shall, with
respect to each Indemnification Claim set forth therein, (i) specify in
reasonable detail and in good faith the nature of the Indemnification Claim
being made and (ii) state the aggregate Dollar amount of Losses to which such
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article that have
been incurred, or a good faith estimate of the aggregate Dollar amount of such
Losses reasonably expected to be incurred, by such Indemnitee pursuant to such
Indemnification Claim (the " _Claim Amount_ "). 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party wishes to object to the allowance of some or all
Indemnification Claims made in a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party must
deliver a written objection to Purchaser (on behalf of any Purchaser
Indemnitee) or Seller (on behalf of any Seller Indemnitee), as the case may
be, within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party
of such Claim Notice expressing such objection and explaining in reasonable
detail and in good faith the basis therefor. Following receipt by Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, of the Indemnifying Partys written objection, if
any, Purchaser (on behalf of any other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable)
or Seller (on behalf of any other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable), as the
case may be, and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly, and within ten (10)
Business Days, meet to agree on the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each Indemnification Claim that is the subject of such written
objection. If the parties should so agree, (i) a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and executed by Purchaser (on behalf of any other
Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or Seller (on behalf of any other Seller
Indemnitee, if applicable), as the case may be, and the Indemnifying Party and
(ii) with respect to any Purchaser Indemnification Claim, as promptly as
practicable and within ten (10) Business Days following execution of such
memorandum, subject to subsection (d) below and _Section 8.2(c)_ (
_Indemnification_ ), the 

 



36  Indemnifying Party shall pay to Purchaser (on behalf of any other Purchaser
Indemnitee, if applicable) in cash the aggregate Dollar amount of Losses
payable to Purchaser (or such other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable)
pursuant to such memorandum and (iii) with respect to any Seller
Indemnification Claim, as promptly as practicable and within ten (10) Business
Days following execution of such memorandum, subject to subsection (d) below,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller (on behalf of any other Seller Indemnitee, if
applicable) in cash the aggregate Dollar amount of Losses payable to Seller
(or such other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable) pursuant to such memorandum.
In the event that the parties do not prepare and sign such a memorandum or
such memorandum does not address in full the written objections timely
delivered, within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt by Purchaser (on behalf
of any other Purchaser Indemnitee, if applicable) or Seller (on behalf of any
other Seller Indemnitee, if applicable), as the case may be, from the
Indemnifying Party of the written objection, then Purchaser or Seller, as the
case may be, may commence an Action to resolve such dispute and enforce its
rights with respect thereto in any court available therefor.

(c) If Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, does not receive a response
from the Indemnifying Party with respect to any Indemnification Claim set
forth in a Claim Notice by the end of the twenty (20) Business Day period
referred to in subsection (b) above, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to object to such Indemnification
Claim and to have agreed that Losses in the amount of the applicable Claim
Amount are indemnifiable hereunder and (ii) with respect to any Purchaser
Indemnification Claim, as promptly as practicable and within five (5) Business
Days following expiration of such period, subject to subsection (d) below and
_Section 8.2(c)_ ( _Indemnification_ ), Seller shall pay the Claim Amount to
Purchaser, or (iii) with respect to any Seller Indemnification Claim, as
promptly as practicable and within five (5) Business Days following expiration
of such period, subject to subsection (d) below, Purchaser shall pay the
Claim Amount to Seller. If not paid, Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
may seek enforcement of the obligation with respect to the Indemnification
Claim in any court available therefor in accordance with the terms of
_Section 10.6_ ( _Submission to Jurisdiction_ ) and _Section 8.2(c)_ (
_Indemnification_ ).

(d) Any amount payable by the Indemnifying Party to Purchaser or Seller, as
the case may be, pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) above shall be paid
promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
applicable payment obligation accrues) by the Indemnifying Party by wire
transfer of Dollars in immediately available funds to such account or accounts
as may be designated in writing by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be.
Any amounts paid to Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, in respect of any
Indemnification Claim asserted on behalf of an Indemnitee other than Purchaser
or Seller, as the case may be, shall be received by Purchaser or Seller,
as the case may be, on behalf of such other Indemnitee.

Section 8.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, except as expressly provided otherwise, this
Article shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnitees from and
after the Closing Date for any claims arising under this Agreement, including
claims of inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be deemed a waiver by any
party of any right to seek specific performance or injunctive relief, or any
right or remedy arising by reason of any claim of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation with respect to this Agreement.

Section 8.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Purchaser agree
to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price for all applicable Tax purposes, including for U.S.
federal income tax and for state tax purposes.
