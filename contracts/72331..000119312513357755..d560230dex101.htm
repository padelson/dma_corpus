Shares, the Assets and the Business Contracts as set out in _Annex 5.1_.

 



29 | 100 ---|--- 

The Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted at Closing as follows and shall be,

The loans are set out in _Annex 5.2.1_. 
---|---|---

and set out in _Annex 5.2.2_.

30 | 100 ---|--- 



   5.3.1 | The Sellers shall submit to the Buyer no later than five (5)

---|--- 



   5.3.2 | The Buyer is entitled to review the Closing Statement within
two (2) weeks following Closing. If the Buyer does not notify the Sellers of

withholdings and without any costs, charges and expenses for the Sellers to
the account of Mr. Jan-Udo Kreyenborg, details of which are set out in _Annex
5.4_. By payment irrevocably received on the aforesaid account, the Buyer
shall be released from its payment obligations under this Section 5 with
regard to all Sellers. The aforesaid account of Mr. Jan-Udo Kreyenborg shall
also be the relevant account for all other payments to be made to the Sellers
under this Agreement, unless any other account has been designated by the
Sellers to the Buyer in this Agreement (including the Annexes) or at least

"Bank Guarantee 2").  
---|---

   5.5.3 | _Joint Provisions for all Bank Guarantees_ 
---|--- 



   (i) | The bank issuing the Bank Guarantee 1 and the Bank Guarantee 2

   (ii) | For "asserting" any claim under the Bank Guarantees it shall
suffice that the Buyer notifies in writing prior to the applicable Relevant
Date a claim to the Sellers (or one of the Sellers), summarizing the facts
and circumstances on which such claim is allegedly based, and specifying the
estimated amount (if possible at the time). However, if the Buyer does not
initiate arbitration proceedings against the Sellers with respect to the
asserted amounts at least within three months after the applicable Relevant
Date, the Bank Guarantee shall expire and shall be returned immediately to the
Sellers after the end of the three months period. 
---|--- 
 



   (iii) | If the Buyer has asserted any claims against the Sellers prior
to the applicable Relevant Date, and the cumulated amount of such claims is

Bank Guarantee shall be replaced after the applicable Relevant Date by a new
bank guarantee in the aggregate amount of such claims. The bank guarantees
shall be exchanged by the Parties concurrently _(Zug-um-Zug)_. 
---|--- 
 



   (iv) | To the extent the Sellers have paid to the Buyer any amounts
claimed by the Buyer and secured under any of the Bank Guarantees, the
relevant Bank Guarantee (i) shall be returned to the Sellers concurrently

corresponds to or exceeds the secured amount, or (ii) be reduced by such
amounts paid and be replaced concurrently _(Zug-um-Zug)_ by a new bank
guarantee in the amount of the difference between the amount of the original
Bank Guarantee and the amount paid to the Buyer (provided that the relevant
period in Section 5.5.1 (ii) and Section 5.5.2 (ii) has not already expired
with respect to such remaining amount). 
---|--- 
 



33 | 100 ---|--- 

The Parties assume that the transaction as contemplated by this Agreement is
a sale of one business going concern, and no value added tax _(Umsatzsteuer)_
("VAT") is payable in connection with this transaction, neither according to
German laws nor under any other applicable tax laws. If this assumption is
incorrect, the Buyer shall pay any VAT, as applicable, in addition to the
Purchase Price, following receipt of Sellers invoice reflecting the VAT as
required by the applicable laws.

balance sheet of each of the Companies for the business year ending 31
December 2012 (jointly referred to as the "2012 Financial Statements")
attached hereto as 
_Annex 6.1.5 (i)_ have been prepared in accordance with the statutory
provisions and generally accepted bookkeeping and accounting principles
applied in the relevant jurisdiction (the relevant "GAAP"). The 2012
Financial Statements were prepared using accounting practices consistent with
past accounting practices of the relevant Company and present a true and fair
view of the assets and liabilities  _(Verm ogenslage)_, the financial
position _(Finanzlage)_ and earnings position _(Ertragslage)_ of the relevant
Company as of the relevant balance sheet date.

(jointly referred to as the "Management Accounts", and together with the 2012

6.1.5 (ii)_ and have been prepared in accordance with past practice of the
relevant Company, but are not subject to any audit procedures and may not be
qualified as (interim) financial statements in any respect. The Management
Accounts have been prepared solely for internal controlling purposes, and the
Sellers do not guarantee that the Management Accounts comply with German GAAP.

following reasons from year-end financial statements:  
---|---|--- 
 



38 | 100 at month end in the relevant Management Accounts; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | revenues and costs might not recognized in line with German

monthly basis in the Management Accounts;

reclassified not in line with German GAAP in the Management Accounts to allow
for better control of the business operations.

adjustments, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, the Management Accounts do not
materially misstate the financial position _(Finanzlage)_ and earnings

these Management Accounts.

   8.1 | _Breach of Guarantees_ 
---|--- 



   8.1.1 | In case any guarantee of the Sellers pursuant to Section 6 of
this Agreement is breached (a "Breach"), the Sellers shall put the Buyer or,
at the Buyers option, an Affiliate of the Buyer or the relevant Company into
the same position that they would have been in had the respective Breach not
occurred _(Naturalrestitution)_ , provided, however, that the Buyer shall have
the right to claim immediately compensation of damages in cash under the
conditions set out in Section 8.1.3 below. 
---|--- 



   8.1.2 | In case any guarantee of Kreyenborg Verwaltungen und
Beteiligungen GmbH and Co. KG pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement is
breached (also a "Breach"), Kreyenborg Verwaltungen und Beteiligungen GmbH and
Co. KG shall put the Buyer or, at the Buyers option, an Affiliate of the
Buyer or the relevant Company into the same position that they would have been
in had the respective Breach not occurred  _(Naturalrestitution)_ , provided,
however, that the Buyer shall have the right to claim immediately compensation
of damages in cash under the conditions set out in Section 8.1.3 below. 
---|--- 
 



   8.1.3 |

If and to the extent remediation in kind (i) is not possible or (ii) has not
been effected by the relevant Seller within a period of sixty days following
delivery of a Breach Notice relating to the respective remediation as set out
in Section 8.3, the Buyer shall be entitled to request from the Sellers
compensation in cash  

---|--- 
 



59 | 100 to a Third Party Claim or if the remediation otherwise involves a third party
as counterpart of the Buyer or the relevant Company, as the case may be (and
only in these cases), the Buyer may elect, in its sole discretion, that the
Sellers shall not be given the opportunity to remediate the respective Damage
in kind _(Naturalrestitution)_ , but compensate the relevant Damage in cash,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. 
---|--- 



   8.1.4 | For the purposes of determining the liability of the Sellers
for any Breach under this Section 8, Section 249 et seq. of the German Civil
Code _(B urgerliches Gesetzbuch)_ shall apply, and the term "damage"
_(Schaden)_ within the meaning of Section 249 et seq. of the German Civil Code
_(BGB)_ shall include any and all direct, indirect and consequential damages
_(mittelbare Sch aden oder Folgeschaden)_, losses, costs, liabilities, claim,
expenses, costs of defence or litigation, reasonable fees and expenses of
attorneys, accountants and other experts as provided in the relevant
paragraphs of the German Civil Code; provided, however, that (i) internal
costs of the Buyer, its Affiliates and the Companies in connection with any
such damages, (ii) any lost profits _(entgangener Gewinn)_ and (iii) any
claims for damages calculated on a basis of multiples or on the argument that
the Purchase Price was calculated upon incorrect assumptions shall be excluded
(collectively, "Damages"). 
---|--- 



   8.2 | _Knowledge of the Buyer_ 
---|--- 



   8.2.1 | Claims for a Breach shall be excluded if and to the extent the
fact that results in the Breach 
---|--- 



     | (i) | has been disclosed to the Buyer in this Agreement and the
Annexes thereto, including _Annex 8.2.1 (i)_ (additional disclosures), or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | has been included in any of the documents stored on the
Data Room CD-ROM (as more specifically described in Section 8.2.3) (the "Data
Room Documents"); provided, however, that any information contained in the
Data Room Documents shall be regarded as having been disclosed only if the
fact(s) resulting in a Breach are readily discernible from the relevant
document revealing or containing the respective fact(s) _(aus dem Dokument
selbst ersichtlich oder eindeutig ableitbar)_ ; all such information,
collectively and in parts, referred to as "Disclosed Information". 
---|---|--- 
 



60 | 100 for all of the Sellers guarantees, irrespective whether such disclosure has
been made with respect to a specific item or guarantee. If and to the extent
a fact has been addressed in this Agreement or in any of the Annexes hereto
and also in any Data Room Document, and if and to the extent any of this
information is contradictory, the information which excludes the liability of
the Sellers to the utmost extent shall prevail. 
---|--- 



   8.2.3 | For evidence purposes, the Parties have jointly deposited two
CD-ROMs prepared by IntraLinks, containing all Data Room Documents and an
index thereto (the "Data Room CD-ROMs") with the acting notary. The acting
notary is hereby instructed jointly by the Sellers and the Buyer to seal these
CD-ROMs and to keep the CD-ROMs and refrain from handing them over to either
Party or any third party. The acting notary shall be permitted, however,
to (i) provide either Party at such Partys specific written request with
copies of any documents included on the CD-ROMs, provided that the acting
notary shall immediately upon receipt send a copy of such request to the
other Party, and (ii) open the seals in the presence of both Parties (or their
Representatives) and provide the Parties (or their Representatives) with an
opportunity to inspect and review the documents on the CD-ROMs. If a Party
intends to inspect and review the documents on the sealed CD-ROMs, it shall
notify the other Party in writing thereof (with a copy to the acting notary)
at least five (5) Business Days in advance. If the other Party, despite being
duly notified, does not show up for the inspection and review, the presence
of such Party at the opening, inspection or review is not required. After
every opening of the CD-ROM, the acting notary shall affix a new seal.
Unsealed copies of the CD-ROMs shall be delivered to each of the Parties. 
---|--- 



   8.3 | _Breach Notice_ 
---|--- 

If the Buyer becomes aware after the Closing Date of any Breach, the Buyer
shall give the relevant Seller a written notice (the "Breach Notice"). The
Breach Notice shall state the nature of the Breach, the facts and
circumstances on which it is based and, to the extent possible, the estimated
or final amount of Damages resulting therefrom. To the extent available, the
Breach Notice shall be accompanied by supporting documentation and evidence.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers shall be under no obligation to
comment on a Breach Notice, and the fact that no comments have been made
shall not be construed as an acknowledgement of any claim and shall not have
any comparable legal effect.

 



61 | 100 ---|--- 

If and to the extent any guarantees given under Section 6 are based upon the
"Knowledge of the Sellers", only the actual knowledge _(positive Kenntnis)_ of
Mr. Jan-Udo Kreyenborg, Mr. Theodor Bruckmann, Mr. Jan Ostgathe, Mr. Ralf
Simon, Mr. Bernd Bakenecker and Mr. Alexander Bruck shall be relevant. If and
to the extent any guarantees given under Section 7 are based upon the
"Knowledge of the Sellers", only the actual knowledge _(positive Kenntnis)_
of Mr. Jan-Udo Kreyenborg as managing director of the general partner of
Kreyenborg Verwaltungen und Beteiligungen GmbH and Co. KG and of Mr. Jan
Ostgathe shall be relevant. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the aforesaid
individuals shall be obliged to carry out any kind of enquiry or
investigation with a view to this Section.



   8.5 | _Exclusion of Claims_ 
---|--- 

The Buyer shall not have any claim for Damages under Section 8.1 or 8.2, as
the case may be, if and to the extent



     | (i) | a reserve for the respective Damage is accrued for in the
Financial Statements; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | in case of matters related to deliveries and services
_(Lieferungen und Leistungen)_ , to the extent general provisions _(Pauschalr
uckstellungen)_ made in the Financial Statements can be dissolved; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | the Damage is recoverable from a third person, including
insurance, provided, however, that if and to the extent the Buyer or the
relevant Company has a claim against a third person for compensation of the
respective Damage or of parts thereof, (a) the Buyer shall use reasonable
efforts, and procure that the relevant Company uses reasonable efforts, to
enforce such claim, and (b) during the time period such claim against the
third person is being enforced, the statute of limitation of the respective
claim of the Buyer under this Agreement is being suspended _(die Verj ahrung
wird gehemmt)_. 
---|---|--- 
 



62 | 100 Advantages_ 
---|--- 

The Sellers shall not be liable for, and the Buyer shall not be entitled to
bring any claim under or in connection with this Agreement if and to the
extent that (i) the Damage results from a failure of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, after Closing, the Companies) to avoid or to mitigate
damages pursuant to Section 254 German Civil Code _(B urgerliches
Gesetzbuch)_, and/or (ii) the relevant Damage is compensated by any financial
advantage of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including, after Closing,
the Companies _(Prinzip der Vorteilsanrechnung)_.



   8.7 | _No "Double Recovery"_ 
---|--- 

Where one and the same set of facts _(Sachverhalt)_  qualifies under more
than one provision entitling the Buyer to a claim or remedy under this
Agreement, the respective Damage shall be compensated only once (no double
recovery). In particular, the foregoing shall apply if one and the same set
of facts _(Sachverhalt)_ qualifies under more than one of the Sellers
guarantees.



   8.8 | _De-minimis and Basket Amounts_ 
---|--- 



   8.8.1 | Claims of the Buyer resulting from a violation of guarantees
under Sections 6 and 7 shall be excluded, unless each individual claim arising
from any single occurrence or item, or series of related occurrences or
items resulting from a common cause _(gleiche oder gleichartige Ursache)_
exceeds EUR 25,000.00, and the total amount of all claims exceeds EUR
250,000.00. In the event the aggregate amount of the claims exceeds EUR
250,000.00, the Buyer shall be entitled to recover the Damages exceeding EUR
250,000.00 _(Freibetrag, nicht Freigrenze)_. 
---|--- 



   8.8.2 | The limitations set forth in this Section 8.8 shall not apply
in cases of fraud _(Arglist)_ or willful misconduct _(Vorsatz),_ provided that
the burden of proof for fraud or willful misconduct shall be completely with
the Buyer. 
---|--- 



   8.8.3 | The limitations set forth in this Section 8.8 shall also not
apply to any Breaches by the Sellers of the guarantees in Sections 6.1.1 to
6.1.4, 6.1.18 (no Leakage) and 7.1.1, provided that in such cases,
the aggregate liability of the Sellers shall under no circumstances exceed
the Purchase Price. 
---|--- 
 



63 | 100 ---|--- 

Claims resulting from the violation of guarantees under Section 8 shall
become time-barred _(verj ahrt)_ 18 months following Closing, except for
claims for Breach of Sections 6.1.1 to 6.1.4, 6.1.16 (Environmental) and 7.1.1
which shall be time barred with the expiration of five (5) years as of the
Closing Date.



   8.10 | _Procedure in Case of Third Party Claims_ 
---|--- 



   8.10.1 | In the event a third party asserts a claim or files a lawsuit
against the Buyer and/or the Companies ("Defendant") in connection with a
Breach for which the Buyer may claim remediation or compensation from the
Sellers under this Agreement (a "Third Party Claim"), the Buyer shall provide
to the Sellers promptly a Breach Notice accompanied by a copy of the Third
Party Claim and all other available information as regards the allegations of
the third party claimant and provide the Sellers with the opportunity to
present to the Buyer the Sellers position as regards the Third Party Claim. 
---|--- 
 



   8.10.2 | The Buyer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
settle any Third Party Claim; provided, however, that in the internal
relationship between the Buyer and the Sellers, no settlement of any Third
Party Claim with any third-party claimant shall be determinative for the
existence or validity of the respective Third Party Claim or the amount of
Damages relating to such matter, unless the Sellers explicitly consent to the
respective settlement. In particular, the Sellers shall not be precluded from
asserting that the Buyer failed to comply with its obligation to mitigate
damages. If the Sellers consent to any settlement of the Buyer or the
respective Company with the third party claimant, no Seller will have any
power or authority to object to the amount or validity of any claim by the
Buyer with respect to such settlement. 
---|--- 



   8.10.3 | The Buyer can, at its sole discretion, ask the Sellers in
writing if the Sellers wish to participate in the defence of the Third Party
Claim. If the Sellers notify the Buyer in writing within ten (10) Business
Days that the Sellers wish to participate in the defence, the following shall
apply: 
---|--- 



     | (i) |

The Buyer shall procure that the Sellers get the opportunity to defend the
Defendant against the Third Party Claim. The Sellers shall have the right to
defend the Defendant with all appropriate measures and shall have the sole
power to direct and control such defence at any time during the 

---|---|--- 
 



64 | 100 and direct all negotiations and correspondence, appoint and instruct counsel
and request that the Third Party Claim be litigated or settled according to
their instructions. In defending the Third Party Claim, the Sellers shall
reasonably take into account the interests of the Buyer and the Companies. 
---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | The Buyer shall procure that the Defendant will fully
cooperate with the Sellers in view of the defence of the Third Party Claim,
provide the Sellers and their representatives (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, their counsel and advisors) at Sellers cost copies of all relevant
business records and documents and permit the Sellers and their
representatives to consult with the directors, employees and representatives
of the Buyer and/or the Companies.  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | All costs and expenses incurred by the Sellers in
defending such claim shall be borne by the Sellers, unless if it turns out
that the Sellers had not been in breach of any guarantee relating to the Third
Party Claim in which case such costs and expenses shall be borne by the Buyer
and shall be reimbursed to the Sellers. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that the Sellers
assume according to this Section 8.10.3 the defence of any Third Party Claim
does not lead to any kind of acknowledgement of the responsibility of the
Sellers to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Companies) from any such Third Party Claim. 
---|---|--- 



   8.10.4 | If the Buyer chooses to defend any Third Party Claim without
any involvement of the Sellers as set out in Section 8.10.3, the Buyer shall
duly defend the Third Party Claim, keep the Sellers informed about the status
of the claim and duly consider any requests of the Sellers regarding the
defence of the Third Party Claim. Section 8.10.1 shall remain unaffected. 
---|--- 



   8.11 | _Non Leakage_ 
---|--- 

In the event of a non-compliance with or breach of the no Leakage clauses in
Section 6.1.18 and/or Section 11.2.5 (xxv), upon request of the Buyer, the
Sellers shall pay to the Buyer (or, if so directed by the Buyer, to a
Company), Euro for Euro, i.e., an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount
which, if received by the relevant Company, would put the relevant Company
into the same financial position it was in, had there not been any non-
compliance or breach of the no Leakage clauses in Section 6.1.18 and/or
Section 11.2.5 (xxv).

---|---|--- 
 

(hereinafter "Tax Damages"). For the avoidance of doubt, Section 8 shall not

---|--- 



     | (i) | are reserved for in the 2012 Financial Statements;

_(Phasenverschiebung)_ ; any such Tax benefit shall be computed as a lump sum
on the basis of the potential Tax savings during the first five years
following the Effective Date and corresponding to the Tax liability, using
the actual Tax rates for the relevant periods (or where the Tax rates are not
yet known the Tax rates applicable at the time of computation) and discounted
at an interest rate of 6 %. 
---|---|--- 
 



   9.3.3 | Tax Damages owed by the Sellers under this Section 9 shall be
paid within ten (10) Business Days following written notice by the Buyer,
provided that (i) the payment of such amounts to the Taxing Authority is due;
and (ii) the Sellers shall not be required to make any payment earlier than
five (5) Business Days before such Taxes are due to the Taxing Authority. If

shall make such Tax Returns available at least thirty (30) Business Days prior
to the due date of such Tax Returns to the Sellers for review. The Sellers
shall have the opportunity to provide to the Buyer within fifteen (15)
Business Days following receipt of the draft Tax Return suggestions and the
Buyer shall cause the Companies to observe the Sellers suggestions when
finalizing and filing the respective Tax Return, except if and to the extent
such suggestions are not in compliance with applicable mandatory Tax laws. For
the avoidance of doubt, a suggestion based on minority opinions in the legal
literature shall also be regarded as being in compliance with mandatory
applicable Tax law for purposes of this Section 9, unless such opinion is
totally inappropriate _(unvertretbar)_ ; provided that such a Tax position
was or will be fully disclosed to the Taxing Authorities in the respective Tax
Return _(Offenlegung gegen uber den Finanzbehorden)_ as required by the

   9.6 | _Procedure in Case of Tax Audits and Other Proceedings_ 
---|--- 



   9.6.1 | Following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall promptly notify the

announced or commenced and relating to any of the Companies and any Tax
period ending on or before 31 December 2012, including in particular, without
limitation, tax audits _(Betriebspr ufungen)_ ("Tax Audit"). Such notice shall
be made in writing and contain all facts and information describing the
subject matter of the Tax Audit or the asserted Tax liability, if any, in
reasonable detail, include copies of any notice or other document received
from any Taxing Authority with respect of such Tax Audit and the asserted Tax
liability of any of the Companies and contain complete information as regards
all facts available to the Buyer and the Companies relating to the Tax Audit
and in particular to any Taxes that potentially generate a Tax Damage (an

   9.6.2 |

Upon the Sellers request and at the Sellers expense, the Buyer will cause
the Companies to retain the services of Sellers tax advisor Heinrichs Rose and
Collegen Wirtschaftsprufer Steuerberater Gesellschaft burgerlichen Rechts,
Munster (Westphalia), ("Sellers Appointed Tax Advisor") to assist with
information and documentation requests of the Taxing Authorities relating to
any Indemnifiable Taxes and in connection with any Tax Audit of any Tax period
ending on or before 31 December 2012. In the event of a Tax Audit of any Tax
period ending on or before 31 December 2012, the Sellers Appointed Tax
Advisor shall have the opportunity to actively participate in every meeting
with the Tax Authorities (including the first meeting and until the final
discussions _(Schlussbesprechnung)_ ), in presence of and in partnership with
the tax advisor of the Buyer ("Buyers Appointed Tax Advisor"), and provide
supporting documents, arguments, facts, etc. to defend the pre Closing Date
tax treatment of the matter under review. The Sellers Appointed Tax Advisor
shall constantly coordinate with the Buyers Appointed Tax Advisor, and
participate 

---|--- 
 



71 | 100 Authorities. The Buyer shall cause the Companies to observe _(befolgen)_ in
all oral and written communication with the Taxing Authorities all
suggestions of the Sellers Appointed Tax Advisor, except if and to the extent
_(ausgenommen soweit)_ such suggestions are not in compliance with the
applicable mandatory Tax laws. 
---|--- 
 



   9.6.3 | In the event the Sellers choose not to have Sellers Appointed
Tax Advisor participate in the meetings with the Tax Authorities, and during
the course of a Tax Audit, the Taxing Authorities raise any issues with
respect to any Indemnifiable Taxes, the Buyer shall provide prompt notice to
the Sellers, giving the Sellers the opportunity to provide supporting
documents, arguments, facts, etc. to defend the pre Closing Date tax treatment
of the matter under review. The Buyer shall cause the Companies to use such
documents and arguments provided by the Sellers in the discussions with the
Taxing Authorities, except if and to the extent such supporting documents and
arguments provided by the Sellers are not in compliance with the applicable
mandatory Tax laws. 
---|--- 



   9.6.4 | In the event of a proposed settlement of an Indemnifiable Tax
matter, the Buyer shall consult with the Sellers (or Sellers designated
representative) and seek the Sellers consent, that should not
be unreasonably withheld. In the event the Sellers Appointed Tax Advisor
strongly recommends _(nachdr ucklich empfehlen)_ to enter into the proposed
settlement, then the Sellers cannot withhold their consent for that
settlement. If an appeal against the proposed handling of the respective
Indemnifiable Tax is estimated to have less than a 50 % chance of success in
the sole and unreviewable professional opinion of Sellers Appointed Tax
Advisor, withholding the consent for the proposed settlement shall be deemed
unreasonable. 
---|--- 



   9.6.5 | If the Sellers shall request that the relevant Company files an
appeal against a decision of the Taxing Authorities relating to an
Indemnifiable Tax, the Buyer shall cause the relevant Company to file such
appeal, except if and to the extent the arguments provided by the Sellers to
supporting their position with respect to such Indemnifiable Tax do not comply
with applicable mandatory Tax laws. The Buyers Appointed Tax Advisor shall be
involved in all aspects of any appeal, Section 9.6.2 shall apply accordingly.
The Sellers shall bear their own costs related to any participation in such an
appeal, the costs of their advisors, the procedural costs of any appeal or
procedure initiated upon their request as well as the costs of the respective
Company related to such appeal or procedure requested by the Sellers.

or before the Effective Date (to the extent not reflected in the 2012
Financial Statements as an asset), the amount of such Tax refund less the
amount of any Tax liability and administrative costs of any of the Companies
related directly to such refund shall be paid by the Buyer to the Sellers
without undue delay; provided, however, that losses recognized by the Taxing
Authorities, including losses carried backwards, shall not be deemed a refund,
and no refund shall be payable in the event the assessment generating the
refund also generates an increase of the tax basis of any Company in any time
period after 31 December 2012. The Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers of
any Tax refund relating to any period ending on or before the Effective Date.



   9.8 | _Non-Compliance; No Deductions; Limitation Period_ 
---|--- 



   9.8.1 | If the Buyer does not substantially comply with its obligations
pursuant to Sections 9.4 and/or 9.6, the Sellers (i) shall not be liable for
any such Taxes that any of them may owe or any reduction of any of their Tax
assets as a result of such non-compliance, and (ii) shall have a claim against
the Buyer to the extent such non-compliance results in Taxes of the Sellers,
Mr. Theodor Bruckmann or any of their Affiliates (not including the
Companies) which would not have occurred if the obligations of the Buyer
under these Sections 9.4 and/or 9.6 had been properly complied with. 
---|--- 



   9.8.2 | The liability of the Sellers for Taxes pursuant this Section 9
shall not be subject to any deductions or limitations, provided, however, that
the aggregate liability of the Sellers under this Agreement shall not exceed
under any circumstances the Purchase Price.
