distribute to each holder of Common Units or General Partner Units, in respect of each Common Unit

which the Rights are exercisable, and the issuance of such securities to the extent that the Rights
are exercised (including those for which oversubscription privileges are exercised and also
including the issuance of the Warrants), as more fully described in this <U>Section&nbsp;2.1</U>, are

such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been
recognized on an actual sale of each such property for an amount equal to its fair

Partner using such method of valuation as it may adopt; provided, however, that the

shall send notice thereof at least 20&nbsp;days prior to such Record Date to each Record
Holder as of a date not less than 10&nbsp;days prior to the date of such notice. The
General Partner also may cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by
it to calculate the number of Partnership Securities or any options, rights,

provided, however, that the Partnership shall not be required to effect more than three
registrations pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.12(a) and this Section&nbsp;7.12(b); and provided further, however,
that if the Conflicts Committee determines in good faith that any offering under, or the use of any
prospectus forming a part of, the shelf registration statement would be materially detrimental to
the Partnership and its Partners because such offering or use would (x)&nbsp;materially interfere with a
significant acquisition, reorganization or other similar transaction involving the Partnership, (y)
require premature disclosure of material information that the Partnership has a bona fide business
purpose for preserving as confidential or (z)&nbsp;render the Partnership unable to comply with
requirements under applicable securities laws, then the Partnership shall have the right to suspend
such offering or use for a period of not more than six months after receipt of the Holder&#146;s
request, such right pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.12(a) or this Section&nbsp;7.12(b) not to be utilized more
than once in any twelve-month period. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Partnership
shall be deemed not to have used all reasonable efforts to keep the shelf registration statement
effective during the applicable period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in
Holders of Partnership Securities covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Partnership
Securities at any time during such period, unless such action is required by applicable law. In
connection with any shelf registration pursuant to this Section&nbsp;7.12(b), the Partnership shall (i)
promptly prepare and file (A)&nbsp;such documents as may be necessary to register or qualify the
securities subject to such shelf registration under the securities laws of such states as the
Holder shall reasonably request; provided, however, that no such qualification shall be required in
any jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership would become subject to general
service of process or to taxation or qualification to do business as a foreign corporation or
partnership doing business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of such shelf registration, and
(B)&nbsp;such documents as may be necessary to apply for listing or to list the Partnership Securities
subject to such shelf registration on such National Securities Exchange as the Holder shall
reasonably request, and (ii)&nbsp;do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or
appropriate to enable the Holder to consummate a public sale of such Partnership Securities in such
states. Except as set forth in Section&nbsp;7.12(d), all costs and expenses of any such shelf
registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by
the Partnership, without reimbursement by the Holder.

otherwise, make any changes or corrections in the Warrant Certificate or the Warrant Agreement that
are required to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be
defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein; provided that such changes or
corrections shall not adversely affect the interests of holders of then outstanding Warrants in any

consent, in writing or at a meeting, of the holders of the then outstanding Warrants exercisable
for a majority or greater of the Common Units issuable under such Warrants at that time, amend in
any way, by supplemental agreement or otherwise, the Warrant Certificate and/or all of the
outstanding Warrants; provided, however, that (i)&nbsp;no such amendment by its express terms shall
adversely affect any holder differently than it affects all other holders, unless such adversely
affected holder consents thereto, and (ii)&nbsp;no such amendment concerning the number of Warrant Units
or Exercise Price shall be made unless any holder who will be affected by such amendment consents
thereto.
