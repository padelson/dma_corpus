_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under

than the third Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.05_ , (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company reasonably agree)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents

 



18  as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver in exchange thereof as
promptly as practicable, the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect
thereof, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying
Agent) and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Except with
respect to Appraisal Shares, until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.08(b)_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to  _Section
2.05(b)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

(ii)  _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article 2_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or
more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.05_ shall
automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver, the Merger Consideration with
respect to such Book-Entry Shares as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.

 

(c) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article 2_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in the
case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock. At the
Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and thereafter there shall be no further recording or registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_.

(d) Any portion of the Merger Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and any former holder of Company Stock who
has not theretofore complied with this _Article 2_  shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration.

 



19 (e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of any
of them, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any amount delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders
of Company Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying
Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue the Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate.

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest the Merger Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income or gain or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock. Any
interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be the
sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and
no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit
of holders of Company Stock;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of
such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of,
or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by,
the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this  _Article
2_. If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Merger Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Merger Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 

(h) Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration or
amounts otherwise payable to any former holder of Company Stock or holder of
Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law. Any amount deducted or withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.08(h)_ and
paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority shall be treated as having been
paid to the holder of Company Stock or Company Equity Awards in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made. Parent or the applicable
withholding agent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so
deducted or withheld to the appropriate Taxing Authority within the period
required under applicable Law.

 



20 Section 2.09 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

Section 2.10 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, each option to purchase shares of Company Stock granted under any
Company Stock Plan (each, a "Company Option") that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully
vested (to the extent not vested) and be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Option _multiplied
by_ (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of such Company Option. Any Company Option for which the
exercise price per share equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for no consideration.
The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay
to the holders of Company Options (through the applicable payroll system, if
practical) the cash amounts described in this  _Section 2.10(a)_ , less such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment, within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time.

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. As of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, each outstanding award of restricted Company Stock
granted under any Company Stock Plan (each, a "Company Restricted Stock
Award") shall become fully vested (with any performance-based vesting
conditions deemed fully satisfied), and shall be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Restricted Stock
Award _multiplied by_ (ii) the Merger Consideration. The Surviving Corporation
or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company
Restricted Stock Awards (through the applicable payroll system, if practical)
the cash amounts described in this _Section 2.10(b)_ , less such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such
payment, within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time.

(c) _Deferred Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary (including adopting any necessary resolutions of
the Company Board (or any appropriate committee thereof) and providing all
required notices in connection therewith) to terminate each of the
Company Non-Employee Director Stock Plans, effective as of the Effective Time
and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time. As of immediately prior
to the

 



21  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holders thereof, each deferred stock unit (each, a "Company Deferred
Stock Unit" and, together with the Company Options and the Company Restricted
Stock Awards, the "Company Equity Awards") that is granted under any Company
Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and outstanding immediately prior the
Effective Time shall become fully vested (to the extent unvested) and shall
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Stock subject to
such Company Deferred Stock Unit  _multiplied by_ (ii) the Merger
Consideration. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company Deferred Stock Units (through
the applicable payroll system, if practical) the cash amounts described in
this _Section 2.10(c)_ , less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to the making of such payment, within five (5) Business Days
following the Effective Time.

(d) _Certain Tax Considerations_. The actions contemplated by this _Section
2.10_  shall be taken in accordance with Section 409A of the Code.

(e) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section
2.10_.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents publicly filed or
furnished by the Company to the SEC on or after December 31, 2014 and prior
to the date of this Agreement (other than any risk factor disclosure

 



22  under the heading "Risk Factors" or disclosure set forth in any "forward
looking statements" or "market risk" disclaimer or other forward-looking
disclosures that are cautionary or predictive in nature) or (b) subject to
_Section 11.05_, as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

Section 4.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware. The Company has all corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its assets and carry on its business as now conducted
and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except where any failure to have such power or authority or to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Company has delivered or made available to Parent true and complete copies of
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational or governing
documents) of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case as amended to date

Section 4.02 _Corporate Authorization_. (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the

the part of the Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Stock (the "Company Stockholder Approval")
is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital stock
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than, with respect to the Merger, (i)
the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) the filing of a certificate of
merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State. This
Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and
Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

Company Board unanimously has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the
Companys stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) resolved to recommend
adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation, the
"Company Board Recommendation").

 



23 Section 4.03 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the

which have not had and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to (x) have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (y) prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger.

 

Section 4.04 _Non-contravention_. (a) The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by the Company do not and will not (i) assuming the
authorizations, consents and approvals referred to in _Section 4.03_ and the
Company Stockholder Approval are obtained, contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of

the Company Stockholder Approval are obtained, require any consent or other
action by any Person under, constitute a default or a violation, or an event
that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or a violation, under or of, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or
the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled under, any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding
upon the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Trapeza, any obligation to which
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Trapeza is a party or by which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets may be
bound or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other
similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (iv) result in the creation
or imposition of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any asset of the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of
clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), which have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) The Company has obtained the written consent or waiver of each of the
Managed REITs under its Advisory Contract in connection with the Merger, in
each case, a true, correct and complete copy of which has been delivered to
Parent (the "Change of Control Consents"). Each Change of Control Consent is

Agreement, there are no issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding (i)

the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to
collectively as the "Company Securities").

(c) There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company
Securities. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
voting trust, proxy, voting agreement or other similar agreement with respect
to the voting of any Company Securities. All outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to
any equity compensation plan or arrangement will be, when issued in accordance
with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No Subsidiary of the
Company owns any shares of capital stock of the Company or any Company

of incorporation or organization, except, in the case of any such Subsidiary,

Subsidiary of the Company has all corporate, limited liability company or
comparable power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and carry
on its business as now conducted, except for those powers or Governmental
Authorizations the absence of which has not had, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to
be so qualified has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
set forth in _Section 4.06(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (such

Liens existing under the terms of the certificate of incorporation, limited
liability company agreement, limited partnership agreement, bylaws or other

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligations of the Company or any

securities of or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company
or (iii) restricted shares, stock appreciation rights, performance units,
contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or rights
issued or granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are

the value or price of, any capital stock or other voting securities of or
other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in
clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to collectively as the "Company
Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of
the Company Subsidiary Securities.

 



26 Section 4.07 _SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act_. (a) The Company has
timely filed with or furnished to the SEC (including following any extensions
of time for filing provided by Rule 12b-25 promulgated under the 1934 Act) all
reports, schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses, registration statements
and other documents required to be filed or furnished, as the case may be, by
the Company since December 31, 2014 (collectively, together with any exhibits
and schedules thereto and other information incorporated therein, the "Company
SEC Documents").

(b) As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement filed prior to the date of this
Agreement), each Company SEC Document complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case
may be.

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement filed prior to the date of this
Agreement), each Company SEC Document filed or furnished pursuant to the 1934
Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement or prospectus,
including any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by
reference therein, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant
to the 1933 Act, as of the date such registration statement or prospectus was
filed or became effective, as applicable, or, if amended or supplemented, and
as of the date of such amendment or supplemental filing made at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement, did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
any material respect. As of the date hereof, none of the Companys
Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the 1934 Act.

 

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that: material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the 1934 Act
are being prepared, and that all such information is communicated in a timely
fashion to the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to allow timely decisions regarding the disclosure of such information
in the Companys periodic and current reports required under the 1934 Act. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



27 (f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system
of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
under the 1934 Act) ("internal controls"). Such internal controls are
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Companys financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal control prior to
the date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and audit committee (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls.

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has extended or maintained
credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an extension of
credit, in the form of a personal loan to or for any executive officer of the
Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the 1934 Act) or director of the

stockholders in the Proxy Statement. Subject to _Section 8.03(b)_ and
_Section 8.03(c)_ , the

 



50  Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting

reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement and take all other actions reasonably necessary

stockholders. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ ,

whether or not a quorum is present or (ii) to the extent necessary to ensure
that any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement is timely provided to
the holders of Company Stock. Regardless of whether there is a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company Stockholder Meeting shall be held in
accordance with the terms hereof unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article 10_.

 

Section 6.03 _Cooperation_. (a) In the event Parent and Merger Sub seek to
obtain any debt or equity financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide all reasonable cooperation necessary for the
arrangement of such financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent and
Merger Sub. Each of Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to any
financing or funding.

 

(b) At Parents request, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in
coordinating introductions to and meetings with Third Party Broker-Dealers
with which the Company and its Subsidiaries have ongoing business
relationships.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.03_ to the contrary, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or permit
the taking of any action pursuant to this _Section 6.03_ that would: (i)
require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or
authorize the execution of the financing or execute or deliver any
certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or
modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement,
(ii) cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) require the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their stockholders, agents or other

instrument be effective until the Closing, (iv) cause any director, officer or
employee, stockholder, agent or other Representative of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (v) conflict with, result
in a violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both) under, the organizational documents of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any Laws, (vi) reasonably be expected to materially conflict
with, result in a material violation or breach of, or a default (with or
without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, (vii) provide access to or
disclose information that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

any of its Subsidiaries; (viii) prepare any financial statements or
information that are not available to it and prepared in the ordinary course

Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, attorneys, accountants or other
Representatives to deliver any certificate, document or instrument, that is
effective prior to the occurrence of the Closing or that would be effective if
the Closing does not occur or (x) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this
_Section 6.03_ or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with
respect to the financing. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries hereby
consents to the reasonable use of its logos in connection with the financing,
provided that such use is disclosed to the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, in writing prior to the time that it is so used, such logos are
used in a manner that could not reasonably be expected to harm or disparage
the Company, its Subsidiaries or their marks and on such other
customary terms and conditions as the Company or applicable Subsidiary shall
reasonably impose. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection
with such cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and
all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of

this _Section 6.03_ and any information used in connection therewith (other
than information provided in writing by the Company or its Subsidiaries
specifically in connection with its obligations pursuant to this _Section
6.03_); _provided_ , that Parent shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 6.04 _Public Fund Advisory Contract Consents; Public Fund
Proxy Statements_. (a) With respect to each Public Fund, the Company shall,

this Agreement, and to the extent required by applicable Law or the terms of
any Contract or any organizational document of such Public Fund, (x) obtain
the approval of a majority of the trustees of such Public Fund and a majority
of the trustees of such Public Fund who are not "interested persons" (as such

Public Fund ("Public Fund Board Approval") of a new investment advisory
agreement between such Public Fund and the applicable Subsidiary of the
Company (a "New IAA") that (A) becomes effective as of the later of the
Closing Date or approval of such New IAA by the vote of a "majority of the
outstanding voting securities" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of
such Public Fund ("Public Fund Shareholder Approval") and (B) contains terms
substantially the same as (but with identical advisory fees as set forth in
the applicable Advisory Contract) the Advisory Contract between such
Subsidiary and such Public Fund as in effect on the date of this Agreement
(or, if amended after the date hereof as permitted by this Agreement, as in
effect on the date of such amendment), and (y) cause such Public Funds board
of trustees to recommend approval of such New IAA to the shareholders of such
Public Fund; (ii) cause the board of trustees of such Public Fund to call a
meeting of the shareholders of such Public Fund to approve the New IAA for

requirements of applicable Law, following the date of

 



52  this Agreement; (iii) as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and to the extent required by applicable Law or the terms of any
Contract or any organizational document of a Public Fund, obtain Public Fund
Board Approval of an "interim contract" (within the meaning of Rule 15a-4
under the Investment Company Act) between such Public Fund and the applicable
Subsidiary of the Company that (x) becomes effective upon the Closing in the
event the Closing occurs prior to Public Fund Shareholder Approval of such New
IAA and (y) contains terms substantially the same as (but with identical
advisory fees as set forth in the applicable Advisory Contract) the Advisory
Contract between such Subsidiary and such Public Fund as in effect on the date
of this Agreement (or, if amended after the date hereof as permitted by this
Agreement, as in effect on the date of such amendment thereof)
(an "Acceptable Interim IAA"); and (iv) cooperate with Parent in connection
with taking the actions and obtaining the approvals described in clauses (i)
through (iii) above and in _Section 8.10(a)_, including making the
directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries

and for assisting in the preparation of the proxy statements, any
presentations or other materials, or any communications to be made to such
Public Funds board of trustees in furtherance of taking the actions and
obtaining the approvals described in clauses (i) through (iii) above and
_Section 8.10(a)_.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the receipt of each Public
Fund Board Approval, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries shall (in
coordination with each Public Fund) use reasonable best efforts to: (i)
prepare and file proxy materials for a shareholder meeting of such Public Fund
(A) for the purpose of voting on the approval of the New IAA for such
Public Fund and (B) with respect to Diversified Income Fund, to elect each of
the trustees thereof appointed by the board of trustees of Diversified Income
Fund (other than any individual resigning as a trustee effective as of

Funds Public Fund Shareholder Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the mailing of the Public Fund Proxy Statement. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the shareholders of each
Public Fund proxies in favor of the approval of its New IAA and, with respect
to Diversified Income Fund, elect each of the existing trustees thereof
appointed by the board of trustees of Diversified Income Fund (other than any
individual resigning as a trustee effective as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as set forth on _Section 8.10(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter), and take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to
secure the Public Fund Shareholder Approval of such New IAA and the election
of such trustees. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Public Fund Proxy Statements, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, prior to their filing with the SEC. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to notify Parent reasonably
promptly of the receipt of any comments, whether written or oral, from the SEC
and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Public
Fund Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with (i) copies of all
correspondence between the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Public
Funds, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the

comment on the response to those comments and requests. The Company (in
coordination with the

 



53  applicable Public Fund) shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve,
and Parent agrees to consult and cooperate with the Company in resolving, all
SEC comments with respect to the Public Fund Proxy Statements as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt thereof.

(c) Parent shall cooperate with the Company and its Subsidiaries in taking
the actions and obtaining the approvals described in _Section 6.04(a)_ and in

Shareholder Approval for each Public Fund, including making the
directors, officers and employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries reasonably
available for presentations to such Public Funds board of trustees and for
assisting, at the Companys, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives request, in the preparation of the proxy statements, any
presentations or other materials, or any communications to be made to such
Public Funds board of trustees in furtherance of taking the actions and

with the SEC in connection with obtaining the Public Fund Shareholder
Approvals, as amended or supplemented by any amendment or supplement filed
with the SEC, will, at the date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the
Public Funds or at the time of the shareholder meeting of the Public Funds
held to obtain the Public Fund Shareholder Approvals, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light

ARTICLE 7

 

 _COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 

Section 7.01 _Conduct of Parent_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article 10_ , neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take or agree to take any
action (including entering into any agreements with respect to any
acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or business combinations) which
would reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in
(a) a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (b) the imposition of a material
condition or conditions on any Consents and Approvals.

 

Section 7.02 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform when due its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 7.03 _Director and Officer Indemnification_. (a) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of each former and
present director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee, fiduciary or
employee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request
or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together
with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, a

 



54  "Company Indemnified Party"), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
Proceeding or investigation with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions
and actions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another
Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) as in effect on the date of
this Agreement or in any agreement, a true and complete copy of which
agreement has been provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, shall
survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms. For a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Parent and the Company shall cause to be maintained in effect the
provisions in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws and comparable
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary of
the Company (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the
Surviving Corporation) regarding exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, in each
case in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions or the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses provisions of the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws set forth in _Exhibit B_
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
individual who immediately before the Effective Time was a Company Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect
of any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, an "Action")
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

(b) For a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless (and
advance funds in respect of the foregoing) each Company Indemnified Party to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law against any costs or
expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Company Indemnified Party), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened Action arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company
Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, but subject to Parents
and the Surviving Corporations receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such Company Indemnified Party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate
with the Company Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



55 (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving
Corporation hereby agrees, to either (i) continue to maintain in effect for a
period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective Time the Companys
directors and officers insurance policies (the "DandO Insurance") in place
as of the date of this Agreement or (ii) purchase comparable DandO Insurance
for such six (6)-year period from a carrier with comparable or better credit
ratings to the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policies, in each case, with coverage for the persons who are
covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured
individuals as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policies pursuant to this sentence an aggregate premium amount in excess
of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year,
which amount is set forth in _Section 7.03(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the "Premium Cap"); and  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding the Premium Cap. At the Companys option, the
Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid "tail policy" for
a period of no more than six (6) years after the Effective Time with coverage
for the persons who are covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with
terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to
the insured individuals as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in which
event Parent shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of
this _Section 7.03(c)_ ; _provided_ , that the aggregate premium for such
policies shall not exceed the Premium Cap. In the event the Company elects to
purchase such a "tail policy," the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts
to) maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect and continue to honor
its obligations thereunder.

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper
provision to be made so the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, succeed to or assume the applicable
obligations of such Party set forth in this _Section 7.03_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.03_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified or insured person hereunder (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract, at
Law or otherwise.

Section 7.04 _Employee Matters_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the one-year period
following the Effective Time (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and
its

 



56  Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) immediately
following the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee"), with (i) a base
salary or hourly rate that is at least equal to the base salary or hourly rate
provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) commission, cash bonus and long-term incentive opportunities, as
applicable, that are no less favorable than the commission, cash bonus and
long-term incentive opportunities provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date (except that no equity-based
compensation shall be considered or taken into account for purposes of
determining whether opportunities are no less favorable), and (iii) employee
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date. In addition and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing two sentences, during the Continuation Period (or such longer period
as may be required by applicable Law), Parent shall provide, or shall cause
to be provided, to each Continuing Employee identified on _Section 7.04(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter whose employment is terminated without Cause (as
defined in _Section 7.04(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) during such
period with the severance benefits set forth in _Section 7.04(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ that the receipt of any such severance
shall be conditioned upon and subject to the execution (and non-revocation)
by such employee of a customary release of claims in favor of Parent and its
Affiliates (in substantially the form used by the Company as of the date
hereof with respect to terminations of employment, a copy of which has been
made available to Parent prior to the date hereof) (a "Release of Claims").

(b) If any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in any
"employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Parent Plans"), then,
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit
accrual, service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary)
prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries solely to the extent recognized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits, (B) no recognition of service shall be required under any newly
established plan for which prior service of similarly situated employees of
Parent is not taken into account, and (C) Parent shall not be required to
provide service credit for any equity or equity-based compensation under any
Parent Plan or any benefit accrual purposes under any Parent Plan that is
a defined benefit pension plan. In addition, subject to the terms of the
applicable Parent Plan and applicable Law, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or caused to be waived, all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees
under any Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in which such Continuing
Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time solely to
the extent such conditions and exclusions and waiting periods were satisfied
or did not apply to such employees under the corresponding welfare plan
maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each
Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Closing Date during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
Parent Plans that are welfare plans in which such Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate after the Effective Time solely to the extent credited
under the corresponding welfare plan maintained by the Company prior to the
Effective Time.

 



57 (c) The Company shall pay, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
an Affiliate thereof to pay, as applicable, annual bonuses in respect of the
2016 fiscal year as follows:

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall establish a bonus amount
pursuant to the Companys annual bonus or revenue-sharing plans or
arrangements for each participant therein (each, a "Bonus Plan Participant")
for the portion of the 2016 fiscal year that ends on the earlier of December
31, 2016 and the Closing Date (the "2016 Bonus Amount") in an amount no
greater than the product of (i) the annual cash bonus received by such Bonus
Plan Participant in respect of the 2015 fiscal year _multiplied by_ (ii)
either (A) one (1) (if the Closing Date occurs on or after December 31, 2016)
or (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the
2016 fiscal year through and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is 366 (if the Closing Date occurs prior to December 31, 2016).

 

(ii) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the time the Company would pay
annual bonuses in respect of the 2016 fiscal year in the ordinary course of
business, then no later than March 15, 2017, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or an Affiliate thereof to pay to each Bonus Plan Participant who
is continuously employed through the payment date, an annual bonus in respect
of the entire 2016 fiscal year, which amount shall be no less than such
persons 2016 Bonus Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, prior to the
payment of annual bonuses in respect of the 2016 fiscal year, a Bonus Plan
Participants employment is terminated without Cause or such Bonus Plan
Participants employment terminates in a manner entitling such Bonus Plan
Participant to severance or termination payments under an employment or other
agreement with the Company or any of its Affiliates, then Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof to pay to such Bonus Plan
Participant a prorated bonus in respect of the 2016 fiscal year in an amount
equal to the product of (A) the annual cash bonus earned by such Bonus Plan
Participant in respect of the 2015 fiscal year _multiplied by_ (B) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days the Participant was employed by
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof during the 2016
fiscal year and the denominator of which is 366. Any such prorated bonus shall
be paid to the Bonus Plan Participant within sixty (60) days following such
Bonus Plan Participants termination of employment, subject to such Bonus Plan
Participants execution of a Release of Claims that becomes effective and non-
revocable under applicable law within the sixty (60)-day period following
such termination of employment.

(iii) If the Effective Time has not occurred by the time the Company would
pay annual bonuses in respect of the 2016 fiscal year in the ordinary course
of business, then the Company shall pay each Bonus Plan Participant an annual
bonus in respect of the 2016 fiscal year in an amount equal to his or
her 2016 Bonus Amount in the ordinary course of business.

 



58 (d) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.04_ , expressed or implied, shall (i)
be treated as the establishment, amendment or modification of any Company
Benefit Plan or Parent Plan or constitute a limitation on rights to amend,
modify, merge or terminate after the Effective Time any Company Benefit Plan
or Parent Plan, (ii) give any current or former employee, officer, director
or other independent contractor of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) any third-party beneficiary or other
rights, or (iii) obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any
particular Company Benefit Plan or Parent Plan or (B) retain the employment or
services of any current or former employee, officer, director or other
independent contractor.

 

Section 7.05 _Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act_. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts
to assure that (a) for a period of not less than three (3) years following the
Effective Time, at least seventy five percent (75%) of the members of the
board of trustees of each Public Fund are not "interested persons" (as such
term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act) of the
investment adviser of the Public Fund, (b) for a period of not less than two
(2) years following the Effective Time, there is not imposed on any Public
Fund an "unfair burden" (within the meaning of Section 15(f) of the Investment
Company Act) as a result of the transaction contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, including the Merger, or any express or implied terms, conditions
or understandings applicable thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Parent
or any of its Affiliates obtains an order from the SEC as contemplated by
Section 15(f)(3) of the Investment Company Act, then this covenant shall be
deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to permit Parent, Merger Sub and
their Affiliates to act in accordance with the representations and conditions
contained in the application upon which such order was
granted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
covenants of the Parties contained in this _Section 7.05_ are intended only
for the benefit of Persons who are "affiliated persons" (as such term is
defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act) of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and for no
other Person.

clauses (iii) or (iv) above (other than any consents, approvals or events
required pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)_ and _Section 9.01(d)_ ) shall not

Notwithstanding the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof: (x)

the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without in any way
limiting the generality of the undertakings under this __ _Section 8.01_ ,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each use their respective
reasonable best efforts to: (i) promptly provide to each and every

transactions contemplated hereby on or prior to the End Date; _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to make any changes to

draft form or final form) to any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Competition Law of such Governmental Authority applicable to this Agreement,
the FINRA Approval, any FCA Approval or the JFSC Approval sending reasonably
in advance to the other Party a copy of such document or information
(omitting any information that constitutes a competitively sensitive or
transaction related business secret of the other Party); (ii) promptly sending
to the other Party a copy of all documents, information, correspondence or
other communications relating to this Agreement sent to, or received by the
Party (or its Representatives) from, any third-party or Governmental Authority

without giving reasonable prior notice to the other Party and reasonable
opportunity to participate in any such communication, conversation or

undertaking or agreement (whether oral or written) that it or any of
its Subsidiaries proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v)
allowing the other Party and its Representatives to attend and participate at

after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare (with
Parents cooperation) and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement to be sent to
the stockholders of the Company relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Proxy
Statement complies as to form with the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC under the 1934 Act. Subject to  _Section 8.03_ , the Proxy Statement
shall include (i) a statement to the effect that the Company Board has
determined that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and (ii) the
recommendation of the Company Board in favor of adoption of this Agreement by
the Companys stockholders. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Proxy Statement shall have been cleared by the SEC, the Company shall cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders entitled to vote at the
Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



62 (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning
such Person and its Subsidiaries to the other, and provide such other
assistance, as may be reasonably requested by such other Party to be included
therein and shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the other in
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement and the
resolution of any comments received from the SEC. The Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto, in
each case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. If at any time prior to
the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, any information relating to
the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, directors or
officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

 

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments,
whether written or oral, from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any
request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall provide Parent
with (A) copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement and (B) a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response to those comments and requests. The
Company agrees to consult with Parent prior to responding to SEC comments
with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve, and Parent agrees to consult and cooperate with the
Company in resolving, all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as
promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and to cause the
Proxy Statement in definitive form to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the
Company Shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following
filing with the SEC.

Section 8.03 _No Solicitation_. (a) The Company and its controlled Affiliates
shall, and the Company shall instruct its Representatives to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with
respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 10_ , neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers or directors
shall, and the Company shall instruct its and its Subsidiaries Affiliates
and other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing any non-public
information), or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any
inquiry or the making or submission of any inquiry, proposal, indication of
interest or offer which constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) subject to _Section 8.03(b)_
, approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) subject to _Section 8.03(b)_ , approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other
agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to a

 



63  Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) or a Superior Proposal (each an "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement"), (iv) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal, or (v)
publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
following the receipt of a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that was unsolicited
and made after the date of this Agreement in circumstances not otherwise
involving a breach of this Agreement, the Company may, in response to such
Company Acquisition Proposal and subject to compliance with _Section 8.03(b)_
, furnish information with respect to the Company to the Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Person regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that (A)
prior to furnishing, or causing to be furnished, any such nonpublic
information relating to the Company to such Person, the Company enters into a
confidentiality agreement with the Person making such Company Acquisition
Proposal (an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement") that (x) does not contain
any provision that would prevent the Company from complying with its
obligation to provide any disclosure to Parent required pursuant to this
_Section 8.03_ and (y) contains confidentiality provisions that in the
aggregate are no less restrictive on such Person than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement (it being understood that an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement need not contain any standstill or non-solicitation provision), and
(B) promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company
furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously so furnished to Parent or its
Representatives).

(b) Except as permitted pursuant to this _Section 8.03(b)_ or
_Section 8.03(c)_ , the Company Board shall not (i) effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (A) a written
Company Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in violation of this
Agreement is made to the Company by a Third Party and such Company Acquisition
Proposal is not withdrawn and (B) the Company Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, then prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, and
subject to compliance with this _Section 8.03(b)_ , the Company Board may (x)
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section 10.01(d)(ii)_ if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in
_Section 10.1(d)(ii)_ would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior
to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement:

(i) the Company Board shall provide Parent at least four (4) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
include the information with respect to the Superior Proposal that is
specified in this 

 



64   _Section 8.03(b)_ and the material terms and conditions thereof (including
the identity of the Third Party making the Superior Proposal, as well as a
complete copy of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action);

(ii) during the four (4) Business Days following such written notice (or
such shorter period as is specified below), the Company Board and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in response to such
Superior Proposal; and

(iii) at the end of such four (4) Business Days, the Company Board concludes
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), that the Company
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure
to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the Company to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
_Section 10.1(d)(ii)_ would still be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

__Any material amendment or modification to any Superior Proposal (including
any change to the financial terms thereof) will be deemed to be a new Company
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 8.03_ , and the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of occurrence) notify Parent
of any such new Company Acquisition Proposal and the Parties shall comply with
the provisions of this _Section 8.03(b)_ with respect thereto, but with
references therein to "4 Business Days" deemed to be references to "3
Business Days"; _provided_ , that in the event there is a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change made in compliance with this _Section 8.03(b)_ with
respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall only enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect thereto by terminating this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.01(d)(ii)_. __

 

 __(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, following
the occurrence of an Intervening Event, if the Company Board concludes in
good faith, after consultation with the Company s outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, then prior
to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, and subject to compliance with
this _Section 8.03(c)_ , the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change: __

(i) the Company Board shall provide Parent at least four (4) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
include the reasons underlying the Boards decision to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, including a description of the Intervening
Event that is the basis of such action;

(ii) during the four (4) Business Days following such written notice, the
Company Board and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with
Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to
the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in
response to such Intervening Event; and

 



65 (iii) at the end of such four (4) Business Days, the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the Intervening Event continues to warrant an Adverse
Recommendation Change and that the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent

board of directors (or a committee thereof) or sole member, as applicable.

 

Section 11.03 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the first
proviso of _Section 11.02_ , waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Except as required by applicable Law,
no waiver of this Agreement shall require the approval of the stockholders
of either Parent or the Company. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any Party of any
of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of
such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

 



75 Section 11.04 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
Party incurring such cost or expense. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger (including any real property transfer tax and any
similar Tax) shall be borne and paid by the Company (or the applicable
Subsidiary) when due, and the Company (or the applicable Subsidiary) shall,
at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law,
the Company (or the applicable Subsidiary) shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

Section 11.05 _Disclosure Letter References_. Each item disclosed in a
Partys Disclosure Letter shall, for all purposes in this Agreement,
constitute an exception to, or as applicable, disclosure for the purposes of,
the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) to which it
makes express reference and shall also be deemed to be disclosed or set forth
for the purposes of every other part in such Partys Disclosure Letter
relating to such Partys representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement to the extent a cross-reference within such Disclosure Letter is
expressly made to such other part in such Disclosure Letter or the relevance
of such item as an exception to, or as applicable, disclosure for purposes of,
such other section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure.

Section 11.06 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, by e-mail
transmission ( _provided_ , that receipt of electronic e-mail transmission is
requested and received) or sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier

Section 11.07 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, it
being understood that each Party need not sign the same counterpart. This
Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties hereto.
Signatures delivered electronically or by facsimile shall be deemed to be
original signatures.

Section 11.08 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Voting Agreements (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) are not
intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities
upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clause
(b), following the Effective Time, (i) the provisions of _Article 2_ with
respect to the holders of Company Stock to receive the Merger Consideration
shall be enforceable by such holders, (ii) the provisions of _Section 7.03_
shall be enforceable by each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and
his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (iii) the provisions of
_Section 7.05_ shall be enforceable by each Person who is an "affiliated
person" (as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company
Act) of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

Section 11.09 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not affected in
a manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon such a determination,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this

 



77  Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 11.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
Parties hereto in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , that
Parent may designate, prior to the Effective Time, by written notice to the
Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a party to
the Merger in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to
Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary (except with
respect to representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger
Sub as of the date of this Agreement) and all representations and warranties
made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall
also be made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation; _provided_ , that such assignment shall not relieve Parent of
its obligations hereunder or otherwise enlarge, alter or change any
obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or such other
Subsidiary. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

Section 11.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 11.12 _Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction_. (a) The Parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested
in the federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Delaware
without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. In the event a claim or action should be brought in
equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, no Party will
allege, and each Party waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy
under applicable Law or than an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 

(b) In addition, each of the Parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself, and
hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any
state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying
of venue in any such court or that any judicial

 



78  proceeding in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum,
(iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other
than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court
located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject
matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject
matter jurisdiction, and (iv) consents to service of process being made
through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 11.06_.

 

Section 11.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
