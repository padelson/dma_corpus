  </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Viking, VHI, Harvest and HOC have entered into the
  Combination Agreement with respect to a proposed transaction (the &quot;<b>Transaction</b>&quot;)
  to combine Harvest and Viking (the &quot;<b>new Harvest</b>&quot;). Pursuant to the
  Transaction, holders of trust units of Viking (&quot;<b>Viking Units</b>&quot;) will
  receive, for each Viking Unit, 0.25 of a trust unit of Harvest (&quot;<b>Harvest
  Unit</b>&quot;). </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New Harvest will have production of approximately 64,000
  boe/d<sup>1</sup> comprised of 50% light/medium oil, 25% natural gas and 25%
  heavy oil. With an estimated 215 Mmboe<sup>1</sup> of proved plus probable
  reserves, the combined trust will have a reserve life index of approximately
  9.2 years<sup>2</sup>. As of the closing of the Transaction, it is expected
  that new Harvest will operate approximately 85% of its production and, on a
  pro forma basis, foreign ownership of trust units of new Harvest will be
  approximately 32%. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current intention of Viking and Harvest is that new
  Harvest will initially distribute $0.38 per trust unit of new Harvest per
  month, with the first distribution payable following the closing of the
  Transaction. It is expected that this level of distribution would represent a
  payout ratio of </p>

  commodity prices as of the date of the announcement of the Transaction. The
  Combination Agreement provides that Harvest Unitholders and Viking Unitholders
  will continue to receive monthly distributions of $0.35 and $0.12 per trust
  unit, respectively, through to the closing of the transaction. </p>
  <p>The Transaction will be carried out by way of either a plan of arrangement
  under the <i>Business Corporations Act</i> (Alberta) or a non-statutory
  business combination. </p>
  <i><b>
  <p>Governance of new Harvest</b></i> </p>
  <p>On the effective date (the &quot;<b>Effective Date</b>&quot;) of the Transaction, the
  board of directors of HOC or its successor will be reconstituted as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>M. Bruce Chernoff - Chairman <br>
    Kevin A. Bennett <br>
    Dale G. Blue <br>
    David J. Boone <br>
    John A. Brussa <br>
    William Friley <br>
    Verne G. Johnson <br>
    Hector J. McFadyen <br>
    Hank B. Swartout </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>On the Effective Date, the senior management of HOC will be compromised of:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John Zahary - President and Chief Executive Officer <br>
    Robert Fotheringham - Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
    <br>
    Robert Morgan - Vice President, Engineering and Chief Operating Officer <br>
    Al Ralston - Vice President, Production <br>
    James Campbell - Vice President, Geosciences <br>
    Jacob Roorda - Vice President, Corporate. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <i><b>
  <p>Approvals </p>
  </b></i>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is anticipated that the Transaction will require the
  approval of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by holders of Viking Units
  (&quot;<b>Viking Unitholders</b>&quot;) and holders of Harvest Units and exchangeable
  shares of HOC (collectively, the &quot;<b>Harvest Securityholders</b>&quot;), voting at
  the respective meetings of Viking and Harvest. A joint information circular
  detailing the Transaction is anticipated to be mailed to Viking Unitholders
  and Harvest Securityholders in January 2006. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The completion of the Transaction will also require the
  satisfaction of several conditions set forth in the Combination Agreement,
  including the receipt of all applicable regulatory, court and third party
  approvals on terms satisfactory to Viking and Harvest, acting reasonably.
  Closing of the Transaction is expected to occur prior to the end of March
  2006. Harvest and Viking have also agreed to use their reasonable commercial
  efforts to continue the listing of the Harvest Units on the New York Stock
  Exchange. </p>
