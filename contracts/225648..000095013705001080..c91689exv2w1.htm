 (c) Except for (i) any filings or waiting periods as may be required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), and (ii) any filings with or approvals from (x) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (" _FERC_ ") and (y) such other Governmental Authorities, if any, listed in Section 3.02(c) of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule and in Section 4.02(c) of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the notification and waiting periods, filings and approvals referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) collectively referred to as the " _Purchaser Required Statutory Approvals_ "), no notification and waiting period, declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser or the consummation by Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than such declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or approvals which, if not made or obtained, as the case may be, could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to impair in any material respect the ability of Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement or Purchasers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

such Credit Support Obligation during the past five years. To the Knowledge

financial and other information (including footnote disclosures) that would
be required in an offering of securities on Form S-1 reviewed in accordance
with SAS 100 as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 to the extent that
such financial statements or information is required for the Rights Offering,
if the conditions set forth in  _Sections 7.01(b)_ or _(c)_ have not been
satisfied due to the failure to obtain the necessary consents and approvals
under applicable Laws or an Order of a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall be in effect and Purchaser or the Company is still
attempting to obtain such necessary consents and approvals under applicable
Laws, or is contesting (x) the refusal of the relevant Governmental Authority
to give such consents or approvals, or (y) the entry of any such Order,
in court or through other applicable proceedings; and (B) the right to
terminate this Agreement or to extend the Termination Date pursuant to this
_Section 8.01(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted, directly or
indirectly, in, the failure of the Closing to occur by the Termination Date;
or    

 (ii) if any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or other United States Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and such Order, ruling or other action is or shall have become final and nonappealable;   

 (c) by Purchaser (provided that Purchaser is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations of the Sellers or the Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach would constitute, either individually or in the aggregate, if occurring on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.02(a), (b), (d)_ or _(e)_ , and which could not reasonably be expected to be cured prior to the Termination Date; or   

 (d) by the Sellers (provided that the Sellers are not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement, which breach would constitute, either individually or in the aggregate, if occurring on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ or _7.03(b)_ , and which could not reasonably be expected to be cured prior to the Termination Date.      

 Section 8.02. _Manner and Effect of Termination_.   

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement, written notice thereof shall be given to the other parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made. Upon termination, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no further liability or further obligation on the part of the Sellers, the Company, Purchaser or their respective officers or directors; provided, however, that _Sections 6.03_, and _6.06_  and this    ##### Table of Contents

      

 _Section 8.02_ and _Article IX_ hereof shall remain in full force and
effect and no party shall be relieved from liability for any willful breach
by it of any provision of this Agreement or for such partys intentional
misconduct or fraud.   

 (b) Provided that neither the Company nor the Sellers shall be in material breach of this Agreement, and provided that the Company has provided to Purchaser such financial statements and financial and other information (including footnote disclosures) that would be required in an offering of securities on a Form S-1, including three full years of financial statements, audited by a "big four" auditing firm or, with respect to interim period financial statements, reviewed in accordance with SAS 100, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 no later than April 30, 2005 and, if required to consummate the Rights Offering, financial statements as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 no later than May 31, 2005, in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Sellers or Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_, and at the time of such termination all of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Sections 7.01_ and  _7.02_ are satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, will be satisfied at the Closing), except that the condition set forth in _Section 7.02(h)_ is not satisfied, then Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers an aggregate termination fee of $25,000,000, of which not less than $10,000,000 shall be payable in cash and up to $15,000,000 shall be payable in shares of common stock of Purchaser (valued at $8.13 per share), with such cash and stock to be paid and issued to each Seller pro rata based on the number of Shares set forth opposite each Sellers name on Schedule I). Purchaser represents and warrants to the Sellers that such shares, if and when issued and delivered to the Sellers, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. On the date hereof, Purchaser and the Sellers have entered into a registration rights agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A hereto covering such shares on the date such shares are delivered to the Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.02(b). On the date hereof, Purchaser has deposited cash in the amount of $10,000,000 in an escrow account pursuant to the escrow agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B. Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge that the fee contemplated hereby is fair and reasonable, that the damages to be incurred by the Sellers in the event of such a termination of this Agreement are difficult to ascertain or estimate and the amount of the fee is a reasonable measure of the anticipated harm to the Sellers in the event of such a termination (particularly in light of the potential diminution in the value of the Company resulting from operational distractions and the opportunity cost to the Sellers resulting from certain forgone liquidity transactions), and the agreements contained in this _Section 8.02(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither the Sellers nor Purchaser would enter into this Agreement. If, in order to obtain amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) or the release of amounts escrowed pursuant to this Section 8.02(b), the Sellers or Purchaser make a claim that results in a judgment for such amounts, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive their reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts payable at The Wall Street Journal prime rate in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. The fee provided in this _Section 8.02(b)_, if payable, shall be the Sellers sole remedy and constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.02 to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be relieved from liability for any willful breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and the Sellers shall be entitled to seek any and all remedies in respect thereof.    ##### Table of Contents
