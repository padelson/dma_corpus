the Closing), except that the condition set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;7.02(h)</U> is not satisfied, then
Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers an aggregate termination fee of $25,000,000, of which not less
than $10,000,000 shall be payable in cash and up to $15,000,000 shall be payable in shares of
common stock of Purchaser (valued at $8.13 per share), with such cash and stock to be paid and
issued to each Seller pro rata based on the number of Shares set forth opposite each Seller&#146;s name
on Schedule&nbsp;I). Purchaser represents and warrants to the Sellers that such shares, if and when
issued and delivered to the Sellers, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. On the
date hereof, Purchaser and the Sellers have entered into a registration rights agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;A hereto covering such shares on the date such
shares are delivered to the Sellers pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.02(b). On the date hereof,
Purchaser has deposited cash in the amount of $10,000,000 in an escrow account pursuant to the
escrow agreement attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;B. Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge that the fee
contemplated hereby is fair and reasonable, that the damages to be incurred by the Sellers in the
event of such a termination of this Agreement are difficult to ascertain or estimate and the amount
of the fee is a reasonable measure of the anticipated harm to the Sellers in the event of such a
termination (particularly in light of the potential diminution in the value of the Company
resulting from operational distractions and the opportunity cost to the Sellers resulting from
certain forgone liquidity transactions), and the agreements contained in this <U>Section
8.02(b)</U> are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, neither the Sellers nor Purchaser would enter into this Agreement. If,
in order to obtain amounts payable pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.02(b) or the release of amounts
escrowed pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8.02(b), the Sellers or Purchaser make a claim that results in a
judgment for such amounts, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive their reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts payable at The Wall Street Journal prime rate in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made. The fee provided in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.02(b)</U>,
if payable, shall be the Sellers&#146; sole remedy and constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section&nbsp;8.02 to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be relieved
from liability for any willful breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and the Sellers
shall be entitled to seek any and all remedies in respect thereof.
