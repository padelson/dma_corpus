in the defense, at its own  expense, through counsel chosen by the
Indemnified Party (subject at all times  to the right of the Indemnifying
Party\'s counsel to control and direct the  defense of the action). If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such  claim or litigation, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle any  claim or litigation
resulting therefrom without consent of the Indemnified  Party  unless (i)
the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection  with  any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation 
involving the Indemnified Party, or (ii) the claim seeks an injunction or 
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall 
not  pay or settle any such claim without the prior written consent of the 
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party
shall  have the right to pay or settle any such claim, provided that in such
event  it  shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnifying
Party for such  claim unless the Indemnifying Party shall have consented in
writing prior to  such payment or settlement. If the Indemnifying Party does
not notify the  Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the receipt
of the Indemnified  Party\'s notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it
elects to undertake  the  defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to contest, settle  or compromise the claim but shall not thereby
waive any right to indemnity  therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, except  with the consent of the Indemnified
Party, enter into any settlement that is  not  entirely indemnifiable by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article  VI_   and does  not include
as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the Person or Persons 
asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties of an unconditional release 
from  all liability with respect to such claim or consent to entry of any
judgment.  The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate
with each  other  in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense
of any claim,  including making available records relating to such claim and
furnishing,  without expense to the Indemnifying Party and/or its counsel,
such employees  of  the Indemnified Party as may be reasonably necessary for
the preparation of  the  defense of any such claim or for testimony as
witnesses in any proceeding  relating to such claim.

Section  7.6 _Assignment;  Parties in Interest_

 

 

(a) .  This  Agreement may not be transferred, assigned, pledged or
hypothecated by any  Party  hereto without the express written consent of
the other Party hereto, other  than  by operation of law. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to  the  benefit of the Parties hereto

Section  7.8 _Entire  Agreement_

 

 

.  This  Agreement relates solely to the purchase and sale of Seller's
Membership  Interest in the Company. This Agreement does not modify, amend or
terminate  any  provisions in any of the Transaction Documents relating to
the express rights  and obligations of the Parties following Seller's sale of
the Seller Membership  Interest to Purchaser (including, without limitation,
Section 10.5 of the  Transaction Agreement except that, to the extent of any
inconsistency between  the second sentence of Section 10.5(a) of the
Transaction Agreement and Section  5.5 of this Agreement, Section 5.5 of this
Agreement shall be controlling).  For  the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of Section 10.02 of the Transaction  Agreement do not apply and,
further, Seller, Purchaser and the Company agree  that, other than as may be
provided in this Agreement, there shall be no  post-Closing adjustments in
the Purchase Price or any payment by Purchaser  to  Seller related to
Purchaser's purchase of the Seller Membership Interest. In the  event of a
conflict between the terms and conditions of any of the Transaction 
Documents and this Agreement, the terms and conditions in this Agreement
shall  be controlling.

 

 

Section  7.9 _Amendments_

 

 

.  This  Agreement may not be changed, and any of the terms, covenants,
representations,  warranties and conditions cannot be waived, except pursuant
to an instrument  in  writing signed by Purchaser and Seller or, in the case
of a waiver, by the  Party  waiving compliance.

 

 

Section  7.10 _Severability_

 

 

.  If any  term, provision, agreement, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held  by  a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void or  unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, agreements, covenants  and  restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall  in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal  substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner  materially adverse to any
Party hereto. Upon such a determination, the Parties  shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the  original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable  manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated  as  originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

 

Section  7.11 _Third  Party Beneficiaries_

 

 

.  Each  Party hereto intends that this Agreement shall not benefit or
create any right  or cause of action in or on behalf of any Person other than
the Parties  hereto.

 

 

Section  7.12 _Waiver  of Jury Trial_

 

 

.  Each of  Purchaser and Seller hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by  applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any  litigation as between the Parties directly or indirectly
arising out of, under  or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby  or  disputes relating hereto. Each of
Purchaser and Seller (a) certifies that no  Representative, agent or attorney
of the other Party has represented, expressly  or otherwise, that such other
Party would not, in the event of litigation,  seek  to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other  Party  have been induced
to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the  mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section  7.12_.

 

 

Section  7.13 _Interpretation_

 

 

.  The  Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this  Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation  arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties,  and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any  Party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this  Agreement.
