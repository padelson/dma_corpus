Consideration shall be paid to the Representative on behalf of, and for
distribution to, each Company Stockholder.

 (E) _Contingent Payment Statements._ Concurrently with the payment of any Contingent Payment, other than the Customer Based Contingent Consideration, Parent shall deliver a statement (each a "Contingent Payment Statement") to the Representative setting forth the amount of the Contingent Payment and such reasonable detail required to support the calculation of the Contingent Payment. The Contingent Payment Statement shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Chief Financial Officer of Parent certifying that the Contingent Payment was calculated by Parent in good faith and in accordance with GAAP, consistent with past practices of Parent, unless agreed otherwise under this Agreement. Within ten (10) days following delivery by Parent of the Contingent Payment Statement, the Representative may deliver to Parent a written notice of any objection thereto (a "Dispute Notice"), which Dispute Notice shall contain a reasonably detailed statement of the basis of such objection. If a Dispute Notice is not delivered within such time period, the Contingent Payment Statement delivered by Parent shall be deemed final and binding on all parties. If a Dispute Notice is timely delivered, then the Representative and the Chief Financial Officer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreements. If the Representative and the Chief Financial Officer of Parent are unable to resolve all such disagreements within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Dispute Notice, then the Representative and the Chief Financial Officer of Parent shall choose an independent certified public accountant mutually acceptable to both parties to conduct an audit of the Contingent Payment, the expense of which shall be paid by the Company Stockholders by reducing the Contingent Payment payable to such Company Stockholders; provided, however, that if the audit reveals that Parent miscalculated or otherwise misstated the 



*** Material has been omitted pursuant to a request for confidential
treatment.



7 (F) Contingent Payment by an amount equal to ten percent (10%) or more of the actual Contingent Payment, the expense of the audit shall be paid by Parent. The results of any such audit shall be final and binding on all parties. 



(iii) _Form and Payment of the Contingent Consideration._ The Incremental
Revenue Based Contingent Consideration, the Revenue Based Contingent
Consideration and the Maintenance Based Contingent Consideration shall be
payable at the sole discretion of Parent in either cash or Parent Common
Stock, valued at the average of the closing prices of Parent Common Stock
as reported on the Nasdaq National Market (the "NASDAQ NMS") for the ten (10)
trading days ending on the second (2nd) day prior to the payment of such
Contingent Payments; provided that all payments to holders of Company Options
shall, pursuant to Section 2.4, be paid in cash.



(iv) _Working Capital Deferral._ The Customer Based Contingent Consideration
shall be decreased on a dollar for dollar basis to the extent that the Working
Capital of the Company on the Closing Date is less than (A) the product of (x)
operating expenses for the most recent calendar month prior to the Closing
(excluding Transaction Expenses and depreciation), calculated in accordance
with GAAP, multiplied by three, and (y) four, less (B) $1,000,000 (the
"Working Capital Deficit"); provided, however, that any such decrease shall
be added to the first Incremental Revenue Based Contingent Consideration
payment. Within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date, the Representative
shall deliver to Parent a balance sheet reflecting the assets and liabilities
of the Company as of the close of business on the day preceding the Closing
Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"). Within thirty (30) days after Parent
receives the Closing Balance Sheet, Parent shall deliver to the Representative
a schedule setting forth its calculation of any adjustments to Working
Capital (the "Working Capital Adjustments"), as calculated in accordance the
definition herein (the "Working Capital Adjustments Schedule"), and, upon
request, shall make available to the Representative all records and work
papers used in preparing the Working Capital Adjustments Schedule. Such
Working Capital Adjustments Schedule shall be prepared utilizing the Closing
Balance Sheet, as adjusted to reflect such adjustments, if any, necessary to
state the Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with the definition of Working
Capital set forth herein. If the Representative disagrees with the computation
of the Working Capital Adjustments shown on the Working Capital Adjustments
Schedule, the Representative may, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of
the Working Capital Adjustments Schedule, deliver a notice (an "Working
Capital Objection Notice") to Parent in writing. If the Representative does
not deliver a Working Capital Objection Notice within such fifteen (15) day
period, then the Working Capital Adjustments shall be deemed finally
determined to be as set forth on the Working Capital Adjustments
Schedule. Parent and the Representative will use reasonable best efforts to
resolve any disagreements as to the computation of the Working Capital
Adjustments, but if they do not obtain a final resolution within ten (10) days
after Parent has received the Working Capital Objection Notice, Parent and
the Representative shall jointly retain an independent accounting firm of
national recognized standing to resolve any remaining disagreements. If Parent
and the Representative are unable to agree on the choice of an accounting
firm, then the accounting firm will be a "big-four" accounting firm (or a
successor) selected by lot (after excluding one firm designated by Parent and
one firm designated by the Representative). The expenses of the accounting
firm shall be shared equally so that half of the expenses will be paid by
Parent and half of the expenses shall be reduced from the Customer Based
Contingent Consideration; provided, however, that Parent shall pay for all of
the expenses of the accounting firm if Working Capital as determined by
Parent is understated by more than ten percent (10%) of Working Capital as
determined by the accounting firm, and that all of the expenses of the
accounting firm shall reduce the Customer Based Contingent Consideration if
Working Capital as set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet is overstated by
more than ten percent (10%) of Working Capital as determined by the accounting
firm. The accounting firm shall review the disputed items in the
determination of



8  Working Capital Adjustments and shall render a report to Parent and the
Representative as to its resolution of such items and the resulting
calculation of the Working Capital Adjustments. The accounting firm shall
resolve all accounting issues which are relevant to the determination of the
Working Capital Adjustments. The determination made by the accounting firm
shall be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto for all purposes under
this Agreement. Parent and the Representative shall each use their best
efforts to cause the accounting firm to deliver its completed report within
thirty (30) days after the matter is submitted to the accounting firm for
determination. In the event that any dispute over the Working Capital Deficit
has been resolved prior to the time of the first Incremental Revenue Based
Contingent Consideration payment, amounts due to the Company
Stockholders based on such resolution shall be added to the first Incremental
Revenue Based Contingent Consideration payment. Any amounts due to the Company
Stockholders based on the resolution of a dispute over the Working Capital
Deficit after the time of the first Incremental Revenue Based Contingent
payment shall be made to the Representative within ten (10) days of
resolution.



(c) _Limit on Number of Shares of Parent Common Stock._ Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, in no event will Parent issue shares of Parent Common
Stock to the extent that such issuance would require stockholder approval
under applicable NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, as determined in the sole
discretion of Parent or as directed by the NASDAQ NMS. To the extent the
number of shares issuable to the Company stockholders is limited, Parent at
its sole discretion shall either (i) seek stockholder approval, or (ii) pay
the remaining portion of the Contingent Consideration in cash.



2.2. Dissenting Shares.



(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
time that is held by any stockholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger,
has perfected such holders right to an appraisal of such holders shares
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, as applicable, and
has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal (a " _Dissenting
Share_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b), but shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by the applicable provisions of the DGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Dissenting Share held by a person at the
Effective Time who shall, after the Effective Time, withdraw the demand for
appraisal or lose the right of appraisal, in either case pursuant to the DGCL,
shall be deemed to be converted into, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(b).



(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other instruments
served pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, relating to the
appraisal process received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the DGCL, with the participation of the Company. The Company will not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and
will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, settle or offer to
settle any such demands.



2.3. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued, but in lieu thereof each Company Stockholder, who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by
such holder), shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of the fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, times the
average of the closing prices of Parent Common



9  Stock as reported on the NASDAQ NMS for the ten (10) trading days ending on
the second (2nd) day prior to the payment of the Contingent Payment resulting
in such fractional interest.



2.4. Treatment of Company Preferred Stock and Options.



(a) _Company Options._ At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option
shall, in accordance with the terms of such Company Option, become fully
vested and exercisable upon consummation of the Merger and shall be converted
into and shall become the right to receive, in full and complete satisfaction
and cancellation thereof, one or more cash payments per Company Option,
without interest, as set forth below. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of any
option plan or agreement) that are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4. The Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Surviving Corporation
nor Parent shall assume or continue any Company Options, or substitute any
additional options for such Company Options. All payments to holders of
Company Options pursuant to this Section 2.4 (collectively, "
_Option Payments_ ") shall be paid by Parent to the Representative on behalf
of the holders of Company Options and the Representative shall be responsible
for distributing such Option Payments to the holders of Company Options.
Option Payments shall be determined and made on the Closing Date and each
Contingent Payment Date, as applicable. The obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation to make the Option Payments shall be satisfied upon
final and non-refundable payment to the Representative.



At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether or not such
Company Option has an exercise price that is greater than the Per Share
Closing Date Payment, shall be converted into and shall become the right to
receive one or more cash payments, each payment in an amount equal to the
result of "Xm" minus Kn and minus the amount of any Option Payments made to
date with respect to such Company Option if, and only if, Xm is greater than
Kn, where:



     |  |  |  |  |  |

   |  |  |

Company Option (and where Kn is the exercise price for such Company Option n),

(and where On is the number of Company Options with an exercise price of Kn),
per Table 1 above. 
 



10 (b) _Company Preferred Stock._ Each share of Company Preferred Stock shall be
converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the closing.



(c) _Merger Consideration Certificate._ The capitalization of the Company,
including outstanding Company Options and the terms thereof, immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be set forth on a Merger Consideration certificate
to be delivered by the Company to the Parent at Closing (the " _Merger
Consideration Certificate_ "). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to rely on the Merger Consideration Certificate in connection with
payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 and the Option
Payments pursuant to Section 2.4. Should the actual number of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Options outstanding as of the Effective Time
differ from that set forth on the Merger Consideration Certificate, the
amount of Merger Consideration payable per share and the Option Payments shall
be adjusted accordingly.



2.5. Exchange of Certificates.



(a) _Intentionally Omitted._



(b) _Company Stock Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three business
days), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates which, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(individually, a " _Certificate_ " and collectively, the " _Certificates_ "),
and whose shares are to be exchanged pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to Parent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with its terms, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Non-Contingent Consideration component of the Merger Consideration, the
cash amount payable in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
2.3 and the Contingent Payments payable in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(ii),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In no event
shall the holder of any Certificate be entitled to receive interest on any
funds to be received in the Merger. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration and the cash amount payable in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.3, may be paid and issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is
presented to Parent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.5(b), each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time for all
corporate purposes of Parent, except as limited by paragraph (c) below, to
represent ownership of the Merger Consideration into which the number of
shares of Company Common Stock shown thereon have been converted as
contemplated by this Article 2\.



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ In the event Parent
elects to pay any portion of the Contingent Payments in Parent Common Stock,
no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date on which
such Contingent Payments are payable with respect to Parent Common Stock with
a record date on or after the date on which such Contingent Payments are
payable shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 2.3 until the holder of record of such Certificate



11  shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.5.
Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date on or
after the date on which such Contingent Payments are payable which theretofore
became payable, but which were not paid by reason of the immediately preceding
sentence, with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date on or after the date on which such Contingent
Payments are payable but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.



(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. __ As of the Effective
Time the Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of Certificates previously representing any such Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the certificates
representing such Company Common Stock, as contemplated hereby, or pursuant
to Section 2.2. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.5. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 2.5, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
Company Common Stock for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to and
in accordance with the requirements of applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws.

properties or assets, except in the case of (b) or (c) for violations,
breaches or Defaults which would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.



4.4. No Prior Activities. Except for obligations incurred in connection with
its incorporation or the negotiation and consummation of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, Merger Sub has neither incurred any
obligation or liability or engaged in any business or activity of any type or
kind whatsoever or entered into any agreement or arrangement with any person
or entity.



4.5. Banking and Finders Fees. Except for fees payable to UBS Securities
LLC, there is and will be no investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary retained by or authorized to act on behalf of Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries who might be entitled to any fee or commission from
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



4.6. Valid Issuance of Parent Shares. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to this Agreement will, if and when issued, be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.



4.7. Financing. The Parent has sufficient funds available to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and perform its obligations under, this
Agreement and pay the fees and expenses it incurs in connection with such
transactions and obligations.



4.8. SEC Filings; Financial Statements.



(a) Parent has timely filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
" _SEC_ ") all reports required to be filed by it since its initial public
offering in October 1999 (the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "). The Parent SEC
Reports (a) complied in all Material respects with the



30  requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act as the case may be at the time
they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) and (b) did not as of the
time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of Material fact or omit to state a Material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent has
timely filed all required forms, reports and documents required to be filed
with the SEC and the NASD.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of Parent (including, in
each case, the notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Reports (i) complied
as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto; (ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as
may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act); and (iii)
fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of Parent and its subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of Parents and its subsidiaries operations and cash
flows for the periods indicated (subject, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, to normal audit adjustments).



(c) Parent has in place effective "internal control over financial reporting"
(as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act). Since January 1, 2004, neither Parent nor, to Parents Knowledge, any
director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Parent
has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
Parent or of its internal controls over financial reporting, including
any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Parent has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices. During the periods covered by
the Parent SEC Reports, (i) there have been no changes in Parents internal
control over financial reporting that have not been reported to Parents
Board of Directors and Parents external auditors, and any such reports are
identified in _Schedule 4.8(c)_. To Parents Knowledge, there have been no
instances of fraud, whether or not material, that occurred during any period
covered by the Parent SEC Reports involving the management of or other
employees of Parent who have a significant role in Parents internal control
over financial reporting. 



(d) To Parents Knowledge, no employee of Parent has provided or is providing
information to any law enforcement agency regarding the commission or possible
commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of any
applicable statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation of any
Government Authority having jurisdiction over Parent or any part of its
operations. To Parents Knowledge, neither Parent, nor any officer, employee,
contractor, subcontractor or agent of Parent has discharged, demoted,
suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated against
an employee of Parent in the terms and conditions of employment because of any
act of such employee described in 18 U.S.C. Section 1514A(a).



(e) During the periods covered by the Parent SEC Reports, Parents external
auditor was independent of Parent and its management. For purposes of this
Section 4.8(e), "independent of Parent and its management" shall mean that
Parent and its external auditor complied at all times with the
auditor independence requirements of Title II of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, the SEC and any regulatory body claiming jurisdiction over the
accounting profession.



 

4.9. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended
(HIPAA). Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.9_ , Parent has in effect
agreements with its customers



31  that satisfy the requirements of 45 C.F.R. §164.504(e) or §164.532(e), and
Parent is not on notice of an allegation of material breach under any such
agreements. Parent has not received any written notice or other written
communication from any Person regarding any improper use or disclosure by
Parent or any affiliate of any individually identifiable health-related
information. Parent has had in place continuously since January 1, 2003,
HIPAA policies and procedures that are described in _Schedule 4.9_ and since
January 1, 2003, a compliance officer who has been responsible for maintaining
compliance under state and federal law for all necessary protection of
patient specific information. Parent has complied with state and federal
patient privacy law, including but not limited to HIPAA.

required to be given under Section 228 of the DGCL. The information
distributed to the holders of shares shall not contain any untrue statement

Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, each of Roy Schoenberg and
Ido Schoenberg, who in the aggregate hold at least 38% of the issued and

5.3. No Other Negotiations.



 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has not entered into any
agreement or understanding with, and is not engaging in any discussions
with any third party concerning an Alternative Acquisition (as defined below)
including, without limitation, any agreement or understanding that would
require the Company to notify any third party of the terms of this Agreement.
From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the
Company shall not, directly or indirectly, (a) initiate, solicit, encourage,
negotiate, accept or discuss any transaction or series of transactions with
any Person, other than Parent and its Affiliates involving any
recapitalization, restructuring, financing, merger, consolidation, sale,
license or encumbrance or other business combination transaction
or extraordinary corporate transaction of the Company which would or could
reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay
the Merger (any such efforts by any such Person, including a firm proposal to
make such an acquisition, to be referred to as an " _Alternative Acquisition_
"), (b) provide information with respect to the Company to any Person, other
than Parent and its Affiliates, relating to a possible Alternative Acquisition
by any Person, other than Parent and its Affiliates, (c) enter into an
agreement with any Person, other than Parent and its Affiliates, providing for
a possible Alternative Acquisition, or (d) make or authorize any statement,
recommendation or solicitation in support of any possible Alternative
Acquisition by any Person, other than by Parent and its Affiliates.



(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.3(a) or anything to the contrary that may be
contained elsewhere in this Agreement, if, prior to obtaining approval of the
Company Stockholders, (x) the Company or any of its representatives, receives
a written proposal regarding an Alternative Acquisition (an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ ") from any person, which Acquisition Proposal did not result 



34  from a breach of Section 5.3(a) and appears on its face to be bona fide, (y)
the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (z) the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel that such action is necessary in order for its
directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, then, subject to its compliance with this Section 5.3 and after giving
notice to Parent, the Company or its representatives may (i) furnish
information with respect to the Company to the person who has made such
Acquisition Proposal, or any of its representatives, pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions no less
restrictive than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provided
that such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such person
or its representatives, and (ii) participate in discussions and negotiations
with such person regarding such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal (in each case within twenty four hours of receipt thereof),
specifying the specific terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry (as the case may be) and
the Company shall promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written materials
provided to the Company in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal not
later than twenty four hours after the receipt of same by the Company and, in
order to be able to do so, the Company agrees that it will not enter into any
confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the date hereof which
prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent. The
Company shall notify Parent (within twenty four hours) orally and in writing
of any material modifications to the financial or other material terms of any
such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and shall provide to Parent, within that
same timeframe, a copy of all written materials subsequently provided to or
by the Company in connection with any such Acquisition Proposal.



(c) Neither the Companys Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall
withdraw, modify or amend, or propose to withdraw, modify or amend, in
a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or resolve to do
so; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Companys Board
of Directors may withdraw, or modify or amend in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation, but may not terminate its efforts to hold a
Company Stockholder meeting or to obtain Company Stockholder consent, in the
event that the Company receives a Superior Proposal which did not result from
a breach of Section 5.3(a) or (b) and the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that such action is necessary in order for the Companys Board of Directors to
comply with their respective fiduciary obligations under applicable Law;
provided, further, that no such change of the Company Board Recommendation may
be made until after at least 72 hours following Parents receipt of written
notice from the Company advising that the Companys Board of Directors
intends to take such action and the basis therefor. In determining whether to
make a change of the Company Board Recommendation in response to a Superior
Proposal, the Companys Board of Directors shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent or any other
information provided by Parent in response to such notice.



5.4. Access. The Company shall afford to Parent, and to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
of Parent, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time to all of the Companys properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel, customers and records and, during such
period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent, (a) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other documents filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,



35  properties, customers and personnel as Parent or its representatives may
reasonably request. Except to the extent otherwise required by Law, Parent
will hold any confidential information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.4
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement entered into between the
Parent and the Company dated April 12, 2005 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"). In addition, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange for meetings between Parent and representatives of the Prospective
Customers.



5.5. Company Employees. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with Parent to ensure that employees selected by Parent will
become employees of Parent.



5.6. Cooperation. The Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by Parent or the Company, in connection with the
filing of any of the Companys tax returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to the Taxes of the Company. Such cooperation
by the Representative shall include the retention of records and information
not otherwise in the possession of the Company, if any, which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and providing
additional information and explanation regarding any such material provided
hereunder. To the extent not otherwise in the possession of the Company, the
Representative shall retain any books and records with respect to Company tax
matters relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. In addition, the
Representative shall deliver to Parent all information relating to the
Company Stockholders which may be required to be reported by parent or its
paying agent to any Tax authority pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code, or
any similar provision of Law, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



ARTICLE 6



COVENANTS OF PARENT



6.1. Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.



6.2. Company Employees.



(a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent or an Affiliate
of Parent shall offer employment to such employees of the Company employed as
of the Closing (individually a " _Company Employee_ " and collectively, the "
_Company Employees_ ") as the Parent shall determine in its sole discretion.
Any such offer of employment shall be on such terms and conditions
substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent.



(b) Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall be construed to impose upon Parent and
its Affiliates any obligation to continue the employment of any
Company Employee following the Effective Time.



(c) All Company Employees who accept employment with Parent shall continue in
the Companys existing benefit plans, other than the Companys 401k Plan,
until such time as, in Parents reasonable discretion, an orderly transition
can be accomplished to employee benefit plans and programs maintained by
Parent for its employees in the United States. Parent shall take such
reasonable actions, to the extent permitted by Parents benefits programs, as
are necessary to allow eligible employees of the Company to participate in
the health, welfare and other benefit programs of



36  Parent or alternative benefits programs in the aggregate that are
substantially equivalent to those applicable to employees of Parent in similar
functions and positions on similar terms (it being understood that equity
incentive plans are not considered employee benefits). Pending such action,
Parent shall maintain the effectiveness of the Companys benefit plans. To the
extent that Parent transitions Company Employees from the Companys benefit
plans to employee benefit plans and programs maintained by Parent or
alternative benefits programs, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
grant all employees of the Company credit for all service (to the same extent
as service with Parent is taken into account with respect to similarly
situated employees of Parent) with the Company prior to the Effective Time for
(i) eligibility and vesting purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation
accrual after the Effective Time as if such service with the Company was
service with Parent. Parent and the Company agree that where applicable with
respect to any welfare benefit plan, including without limitation medical or
dental benefit plans, of Parent, Parent shall waive any pre-existing condition
exclusion and actively-at-work requirements (provided, however, that no such
waiver shall apply to a pre-existing condition of any Company Employee who
was, as of the Effective Time, excluded from participation in a plan
maintained by the Company by virtue of such pre-existing condition) and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any of Parents group health plans to the extent permitted
by such plans. Parent shall provide that any covered expenses incurred on or
before the Effective Time by the Company Employees or such employees covered
dependents shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the
Effective Time to the same extent as such expenses are taken into account for
the benefit of similarly situated employees of Parent, and to the extent
permitted under the applicable plan.



6.3. Indemnification by Parent. After the Effective Time, and for a period of
six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless each person serving as a director of the Company and each person
serving as an officer of the Company with respect to actions taken or omitted
to be taken prior to the Effective Time, to the extent such person is entitled
to indemnification under the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as
limited by Delaware law. Each party entitled to indemnification under this
Section 6.3 (the " _Director Indemnified Party_ ") shall give notice to Parent
promptly after such Director Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any
claim as to which indemnification may be sought, and Parent shall, upon
written notice given reasonably promptly following receipt of notice from the
Director Indemnified Party of such claim, be entitled to assume the defense
thereof at its expense with counsel chosen by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Director Indemnified Party; _provided_ that the Director
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such partys expense;
and provided further that if counsel reasonably determines that its
representation of both Parent and the Director Indemnified Party would present
such counsel with a conflict of interest or if Parent fails to assume
the defense of such claim, the Director Indemnified Party may employ separate
counsel to represent and defend it in any such action and Parent shall pay the
reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel. Parent shall not be
required to pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of more than one
separate law firm in any jurisdiction in any single action or proceeding. The
failure of any Director Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein
shall not relieve Parent of its obligations under this Section 6.3, provided
that if such failure materially increases the amount of indemnification that
Parent is obligated to pay under this Section 6.3, the amount of
indemnification which the Director Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
receive shall be reduced to an amount which the Director Indemnified Person
would have been entitled to receive had such notice been timely given. Parent,
in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall not, except with the
consent of each Director Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof, the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Director Indemnified
Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.



37  6.4. Conduct of Business. From and after the Closing, and during the Revenue
Based Contingent Consideration Period, Parent shall operate the Business in a
commercially reasonable manner. In addition, Parent shall not take any action,
or actions, for the sole purpose of reducing either the Revenue Based
Contingent Consideration or Maintenance Based Contingent Consideration,
including but not limited to any action to accelerate or defer any Revenue, or
Maintenance Revenue, or to recharacterize or allocate any revenue in order to
reduce Revenue or Maintenance Revenue. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
herein shall prevent the Parent from taking any action or failing to take any
action which Parents Board of Directors determines to be in the best
interests of the Parent and its stockholders if, and only if the failure
to take such action or not take such action could reasonably be determined to
result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of Parents Board of Directors.



6.5. Recordkeeping; Audit and Access



(a) _Reports_. No later than 45 days after the close of each fiscal quarter of
Parent, Parent shall deliver to the Representative a report showing the
determination of Revenue for such fiscal quarter in sufficient detail to
permit the Representative to confirm such determination. At the time of the
payment of each Contingent Payment, Parent shall deliver to the Representative
a report showing the determination and calculation of the Contingent Payment
in sufficient detail to permit the Representative to confirm the calculation
of the amount of Contingent Payment due.



(b) _Records and Access_. Parent shall keep for at least three (3) years from
the date of each Contingent Payment complete and accurate records of Revenues
of Products, in sufficient detail to allow the Contingent Payment to be
determined accurately. The Representative shall have the right to appoint an
independent certified public accountant or other financial accounting expert
reasonably acceptable to Parent to inspect the relevant records of Parent and
its Affiliates to verify such report or statement. Parent and its Affiliates
shall each make its records available for inspection by such
independent certified public accountant during regular business hours at such
place or places where such records are customarily kept, upon reasonable
notice from the Representative, solely to verify the accuracy of the reports
and payments. Such inspection right shall not be exercised more than once in
any calendar year nor more than once with respect to any Contingent Payment in
accordance with the process set forth in Section 2.1(b)(ii)(E). The
Representative agrees to hold in strict confidence all information concerning
Revenues, and all information learned in the course of any audit or
inspection, except to the extent necessary for the Representative to reveal
such information in order to enforce its rights under this Agreement or
if disclosure is required by law. The results of each inspection, if any,
shall be binding on Parent and the Representative. The costs of any such
inspection other than pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii)(E) shall be borne by the
Company Stockholders by reducing the applicable Contingent Payment, provided,
however, that if the inspection reveals that Parent miscalculated or otherwise
misstated any Contingent Payment by an amount equal to ten percent (10%) or
more of the actual Contingent Payment, the expense of the audit shall be paid
by Parent.



6.6. Relationship with ***. Until the payment of the Customer Based Contingent
Consideration, (i) Parent will not terminate the relationship with *** other
than for breach of the agreement between *** and the Surviving Corporation
and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will in good faith perform their
obligations under such agreement.



*** Material has been omitted pursuant to a request for confidential
treatment.

to then complied with its obligations under this Section 7.3.



39 7.4. Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the Company. The Company shall accrue all expenses incurred by it,
on or prior to the Closing, in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, on the Companys Closing Balance Sheet. All
fees and expenses incurred by the Parent and Merger Sub in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
Parent. Fees and expenses incurred by any party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall include, without limitation,
fees and expenses incurred for legal, financial, accounting and other
advisors.



7.5. Registration.



 

(a) _Demand Registration_. If at any time prior to the expiration of the
Registration Period and after the date on which Parent pays any portion of
the Contingent Payments in shares of Parent Common Stock, any Registrable
Securities shall not have been registered by Parent, then the Representative
shall on behalf of the Company Stockholders have the right by delivery of
written notice to Parent, to request that Parent effect a registration on
Form S-3 covering the resale of the Registrable Securities to the extent
issued; provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to effect any
such registration (i) during the period starting with the date thirty (30)
days prior to Parents good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and
ending on a date ninety (90) days after the effective date of, a Parent-
initiated registration; provided that Parent is actively employing in good
faith all reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective, or (ii) (A) if Parent is engaged in any material activity which, in
the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of Parent, based on
the advice of counsel, would be required to be disclosed in connection with
such registration, and such disclosure would adversely affect such material
activity to the material detriment of Parent, and (B) Parent shall furnish to
Representative a certificate signed by the President of Parent stating that in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Parent, it would be
seriously detrimental to Parent for such registration statement to be filed in
the near future and that it is, therefore, essential to defer the filing of
such registration statement, then Parent shall have the right to defer such
filing for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the
request of Representative, and, provided further, that Parent shall not defer
its obligation in this manner more than once in any twelve-month period. The
date on which Parent receives such notice is referred to herein as the "
_Demand Date_." In the event that Form S-3 is unavailable and/or
inappropriate for such a registration of all the Registrable Securities,
Parent shall use such other form or forms as are available and appropriate for
such a registration, subject to the consent of the Representative, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.



(b) _Filing and Effectiveness of the Registration Statement_. Parent will use
its best efforts to file with the SEC a Registration Statement registering all
of the Registrable Securities requested by Representative pursuant to Section
7.5(a) for resale within 30 days after the Demand Date (the " _Filing Date_
") and to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC
as soon as practicable after filing, and in any event no later than the 90th
day after the Demand Date (the " _Required Effective Date_ "). However, so
long as the Company filed the applicable Registration Statement by the Filing
Date, (a) if the SEC takes the position that registration of the resale of the
Registrable Securities by Representative is not available under applicable
laws, rules and regulation and that Parent must register the offering of the
Registrable Securities as a primary offering by Parent, or (b) if a
Registration Statement receives SEC review, then the Required Effective Date
will be the 120th day after the Demand Date. In the case of an SEC response
described in clause (a), Parent will, within 40 business days after the date
Parent receives such SEC response (the " _Primary Offering Filing Date_ "),
file a Registration Statement as a primary offering. Parents best efforts
will include, but not be limited to, promptly responding to all comments
received from the staff of the SEC. If Parent receives notification from the
SEC that any Registration Statement will receive no



40  action or review from the SEC, then Parent will file with the SEC a request
for acceleration in accordance with Rule 461 promulgated under the Securities
Act and cause such Registration Statement to become effective within five
business days after such SEC notification. Once a Registration Statement is
declared effective by the SEC, Parent will cause such Registration Statement
to remain effective throughout the Registration Period. If (i) the
Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to the Filing Date (provided,
however, that if a Company Stockholder fails to provide Parent with any
information that is required to be provided in the Registration Statement
with respect to such Company Stockholder, then the Filing Date shall be
extended until five (5) business days following the date of receipt by Parent
of such required information, or (ii) Parent fails to file with the SEC a
request for acceleration in accordance with Rule 461 promulgated under the
Securities Act, within five (5) business days of the date that Parent is
notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that
the Registration will not be reviewed or is not subject to further review, or
(iii) the Registration Statement filed or required to be filed hereunder is
not declared effective by the SEC on or before the Required Effective Date, or
(iv) after the Registration Statement is first declared effective by the SEC,
it ceases for any reason to remain continuously effective during the
Registration Period (any such failure or breach being referred to as an "
_Event_ ," and for the purposes (i), (iii) and (iv) the date on which such
Event occurs, or for purposes of clause (ii) the date on which such five (5)
business day period is exceeded, being referred to as an " _Event Date_ "),
then in addition to any other rights the Company Stockholders may have
hereunder or under applicable law: (x) on each such Event Date Parent shall
pay to each Company Stockholder an amount in cash, as liquidated damages and
not as a penalty, equal to 1.5% of the value of the Registrable Securities
then held by such Company Stockholder and not then transferable pursuant to
the Registration Statement; and (y) on each monthly anniversary of each such
Event Date (if the applicable Event shall not have been cured by such date)
until the applicable Event is cured, Parent shall pay to each Company
Stockholder an amount in case, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty,
equal to 1.5% of the value of the Registrable Securities then held by such
Company Stockholder and not then transferable pursuant to the Registration
Statement. If Parent fails to pay any liquidated damages pursuant to this
Section 7.5(b) in full within seven (7) days after the date payable, Parent
will pay interest thereon at a rate of 15% per annum (or such lesser maximum
amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law) to the Company
Stockholder, accruing daily from the date such liquidated damages are due
until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon, are paid in full. The
parties hereto agree that the liquidated damages provided for in this Section
7.5(b) shall be the exclusive remedy of the Company Stockholders for a breach
of Section 7.5(a) or (b) and that they constitute a reasonable estimate of
the damages that may incurred by the Company Stockholders by reason of the
failure of Parent to file or cause to be declared effective the Registration
Statement, or by reason of inability to offer and sell Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Registration Statement, in accordance to the provisions
hereof.



(c) _Incidental Registration_. If at any time prior to the expiration of the
Registration Period and after the date on which Parent pays any portion of
the Contingent Payments in shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent proposes to
register any of its securities under the Securities Act for sale to the public
(other than pursuant to Section 7.5(b)), whether for its own account or for
the account of other security holders or both (except with respect to
Registration Statements on Forms S-4, S-8 or any successor to such forms or
another form not available for registering the Registrable Securities for sale
to the public), each such time it will promptly give written notice to all
Company Stockholders of the Registrable Securities of its intention so to do.
Upon the written request of any such Company Stockholder, received by Parent
within 30 days after the giving of any such notice by Parent, to register any
or all of its Registrable Securities, Parent will use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable Securities as to which
registration shall have been so requested to be included in the securities to
be covered by the Registration Statement proposed to be filed by Parent, all
to the extent requisite to permit the sale or



41  other disposition by the Company Stockholder (in accordance with its written
request) of such Registrable Securities so registered. If the registration
of which Parent gives notice is for a registered public offering involving an
underwriting, Parent shall so advise the holders of Registrable Securities as
a part of the written notice given pursuant to this Section 7.5(c). In such
event the right of any holder of Registrable Securities to registration
pursuant to this Section 7.5(c) shall be conditioned upon such holders
participation in such underwriting to the extent provided herein. All holders
of Registrable Securities proposing to distribute their securities through
such underwriting shall (together with Parent and the other Parent
stockholders distributing their securities through such underwriting) enter
into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or
underwriters selected for underwriting by Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section 7.5(c), if the underwriter determines that marketing
factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, such
limitation will be imposed pro rata with respect to all securities whose
holders have a contractual, incidental ("piggy back") right to include such
securities in the Registration Statement and as to which inclusion has been
requested pursuant to such right. Parent shall be obligated to include in
such Registration Statement only such limited portion of Registrable
Securities with respect to which such holder has requested inclusion
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, Parent may withdraw any
Registration Statement referred to in this Section 7.5(c) without thereby
incurring any liability to the holders of Registrable Securities. If any
holder of Registrable Securities disapproves of the terms of any such
underwriting, it may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to Parent
and the underwriter. Any Registrable Securities or other securities excluded
or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such
registration. 



(d) _Review by the Representative._ The Representative covenants and agrees
that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts provide to Parent on a
timely basis such consents, representations and information from the Company
Stockholders as may reasonably be required by Parent in connection with the
preparation and filing of a Registration Statement or related prospectus or
any amendment or supplement thereto. Parent will, prior to filing a
Registration Statement or related prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, furnish to the Representative copies of such Registration Statement
and prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto as proposed to be filed,
together with exhibits thereto, which documents will be subject to review and
approval by the Representative (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).



(e) _Expenses._ Parent shall pay all expenses of registration of any shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 7.5(a) and Section 7.5(b), except
brokerage commissions, legal expenses, and such other expenses as may be
required by law to be paid by the Company Stockholders, which commissions and
expenses shall be paid by the party by which such expenses are incurred.



(f) _Notification._ Parent will promptly notify the Representative upon the
occurrence of any of the following events in respect of a Registration
Statement or related prospectus: (i) receipt of any request for additional
information by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority
during the period of effectiveness of the Registration Statement or
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or any related
prospectus; (ii) the issuance by the SEC or any other federal or state
governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose;
(iii) receipt of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification or exemption from qualification of the shares of Parent Common
Stock registered pursuant to Section 7.5(a) for sale in any jurisdiction or
the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose; (iv) the happening of any
event that makes any statement made in the Registration Statement or related
prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein
by reference untrue in any material respect or that



42  requires the making of any changes in the Registration Statement, related
prospectus or documents so that (or Parent otherwise becomes aware of any
statement included in the Registration Statement, related prospectus or
documents that is untrue in any material respect or that requires the making
of any changes in the Registration Statement, related prospectus or documents
so that), in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and that in the case of the related prospectus, it will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; and (v) Parents reasonable determination that a post-
effective amendment to the Registration Statement would be appropriate (in
which event Parent will promptly make available to the Representative any such
supplement or amendment to the Registration Statement and, as applicable, the
related prospectus).



(g) _Indemnification._ In the event that any shares of Parent Common Stock are
included in a Registration Statement under this Agreement:



(i) To the extent permitted by law, Parent will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Company Stockholder that holds such shares of Parent Common
Stock, and agents, employees, attorneys, accountants, underwriters (as defined
in the Securities Act) for such Company Stockholder and any directors or
officers of such Company Stockholder or such underwriter and any person who
controls such Company Stockholder or such underwriter within the meaning of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each, an " _Company Stockholder
Indemnified Person_ ") against any losses, claims, damages, expenses
or liabilities (collectively, and together with actions, proceedings or
inquiries by any regulatory or self-regulatory organization, whether commenced
or threatened in respect thereof, " _Claims_ ") to which any of them become
subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as
such Claims arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements,
omissions or violations in a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
Agreement, any post-effective amendment thereof or any prospectus included
therein: (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereof or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, (b) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in the prospectus or any preliminary prospectus (as it may be
amended or supplemented) or the omission or alleged omission to state therein
any material fact necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which the statements therein were made,
not misleading, or (c) any violation or alleged violation by Parent of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other law, including without
limitation any state securities law or any rule or regulation thereunder (the
matters in the foregoing clauses (a) through (c) being, collectively, "
_Violations_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the indemnification agreement contained in this Section 7.5(f)(i) does not
apply to a Claim by a Company Stockholder Indemnified Person arising out of
or based upon a Violation that occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished to Parent by such Company Stockholder Indemnified Person
expressly for use in the Registration Statement or any such amendment thereof
or supplement thereto; and (ii) does not apply to amounts paid in settlement
of any Claim if such settlement is made without the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. This indemnity
obligation will remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of a Company Stockholder Indemnified Person
and will survive the transfer of the shares of Parent Common Stock by
the Company Stockholders under Section 7.5(g) of this Agreement.



43 (ii) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Company
Stockholder is participating, each such Company Stockholder will indemnify
and hold harmless, to the same extent and in the same manner set forth in
Section 7.5(f)(i) above, Parent, each of its directors, each of its officers
who signs the Registration Statement, each person, if any, who controls
Parent within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and any
other stockholder selling securities pursuant to the Registration Statement or
any of its directors or officers or any person who controls such stockholder
within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (each a " _Parent
Indemnified Person_ ") against any Claim to which any of them may become
subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as
such Claim arises out of or is based upon any Violation, in each case to the
extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished to Parent by such Company
Stockholder expressly for use in such Registration Statement. However, the
indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7.5(f)(ii) does not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such settlement is effected without
the prior written consent of such Company Stockholder, which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, and no Company Stockholder will be liable under this
Agreement for the amount of any Claim that exceeds the net proceeds actually
received by such Company Stockholder as a result of the sale of shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to such Registration Statement. This indemnity
will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of a Parent Indemnified Person and will survive the transfer of
the shares of Parent Common Stock by the Company Stockholders under Section
7.5(g) of this Agreement.



(iii) If any proceeding shall be brought or asserted against any person
entitled to indemnity under Sections 7.5(f)(i) or 7.5(f)(ii) hereof (an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), such Indemnified Party promptly shall notify the
person from whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing,
and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including
the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party
and the payment of all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection
with defense thereof; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnified
Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except (and only) to
the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or further review)
that such failure shall have proximately and materially adversely prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party.



(iv) An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Party or Indemnified Parties unless: (i) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in
writing to pay such fees and expenses; (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have
failed promptly to assume the defense of such proceeding and to employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such
proceeding; or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any
impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, and such Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that a
conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent
such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such
Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to
employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and
such counsel shall be at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be
responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel). The
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such
proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending
proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless such
settlement includes an



44  unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on Claims
that are the subject matter of such proceeding.



(h) _Assignment of Registration Rights._ The rights set forth in this Section
7.5, may be assigned by the Company Stockholders to transferees or assignees
of all or any portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock, but only if (a)
the Company Stockholder agrees in writing with the transferee or assignee
to assign such rights, and a copy of such agreement is furnished to Parent
within a reasonable time after such assignment, (b) Parent is, within a
reasonable time after such transfer or assignment, furnished with written
notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the
securities with respect to which such registration rights are being
transferred or assigned, (c) after such transfer or assignment, the further
disposition of such securities by the transferee or assignee is restricted
under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, (d) at or
before the time Parent received the written notice contemplated by clause (b)
of this sentence, the transferee or assignee agrees in writing with Parent to
be bound by all of the provisions contained herein, and (e) the transferee is
an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D.



(i) _Additional Requirements._ Until termination of the Registration
Statement, Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to make and
keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined
in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and file on a timely basis
with the SEC all information that it may be required to file under either of
Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and, so long as it is required
to file such information, use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the availability of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any
successor exemptive rule hereinafter in effect) with respect to shares of
Parent common stock.



7.6. Required Approvals.



(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, each party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals
of Governmental Authorities and other Persons required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to the Closing, including, without limitation, taking all
required actions relating to the HSR Act as set forth in Section 7.6(b)
below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise agreed to by the
parties, no party will have any obligation to pay any material fee to any
third party (not including filing or other fees payable to Governmental
Authorities) for the purpose of obtaining any consents or approvals.



(b) Each party (i) shall cooperate with the other parties and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to file required Notification and Report Forms
under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the
Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement (but in no event later than ten (10) business days from and
after the date hereof); (ii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act; (iii) agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate with the FTC, the DOJ and/or
any other Governmental Authority in respect of such filings to prevent the
issuance of any requests for additional information, documents or other
materials under the HSR Act; provided, that, (x) if such a request is about to
be issued notwithstanding the parties efforts, the parties shall discuss the
withdrawal and refiling of the filings to avoid the issuance of such a request
and to enable the parties to continue to attempt to resolve the issues raised
by any Governmental Authority in connection with the filings without the need
to respond to any such request, and each of the parties shall have the option
of withdrawal and refiling, and that, (y) if any such requests are nonetheless
issued, to seek modification of same and comply at the earliest



45  practicable date with respect thereto, as modified; and (iv) shall act in
good faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection
with any such filing and in connection with resolving any investigation or
other inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Authority under any
Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. To the
extent not prohibited by Law, each party to this Agreement shall use
reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and
Parent shall give the other reasonable prior notice of any communication with,
and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such transaction.
Neither the Company, on the one hand, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall independently participate in any
meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry
without giving Parent or the Company, as the case may be, prior notice of the
meeting and discussing with Parent or the Company, as the case may be, the
advisability of Parents or the Companys representatives, as the case may
be, participating in such meeting or conversation. Each of Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be
required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or
other antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.6 shall require, or
be construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell or hold
separate and agree to sell, before or after the Closing Date, any assets,
businesses or interest in any assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or
any of their Affiliates (or consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, by the
Company of any of their assets or businesses) or agree to any material changes
or restrictions in the operations of any such assets or businesses.



(c) Each party shall bear its own costs for filing and other fees payable
to Governmental Authorities, except for the filing fee under the HSR Act,
which the parties agree to share equally. On the filing date of the
Notification under the HSR Act by Parent, the Company shall deliver payment in
immediately available funds to Parent for one half of the filing fee.



7.7. Change of Control of Parent. If, during the Revenue Based Contingent
Consideration Payment Period, Parent proposes to enter into a Change of
Control, such Change Control shall be conditioned upon the successor
organization agreeing to undertake the obligations of Parent under this
Agreement.

warranties and covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement shall
terminate at the Effective Time or upon the termination of this Agreement

contemplates performance, in whole or in part, after the Effective Time. 



10.2. Representative.



(a) The Representative shall not be liable to any Company Stockholder for any
act done or omitted hereunder as the Representative while acting in good
faith. The Representative undertakes to perform such duties and only such
duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the
Representative. The Company Stockholders shall, severally and not jointly, on

and outstanding as of the Effective Time, indemnify the Representative and
hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance
or administration of his duties hereunder, including without limitation the
legal costs and expenses of defending the Representative against any claim or
liability in connection with the performance of the Representatives duties.



(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Representative

entitled under this Agreement and the Representative shall not in any manner
exercise, or seek to exercise, any voting power whatsoever with respect to

holder of Company Stock



(c) The Representative shall have reasonable access to information about the
Company and the reasonable assistance of the Companys officers and employees
for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder,

any nonpublic information from or about the Company to anyone (except on a
need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such information
confidentially).

removal from office, incapacity or death; provided, however, that the
Representative shall not have the right to resign without (i) prior written
notice to the Company Stockholders and (ii) determination of a successor
reasonably satisfactory to Parent to serve until a successor thereto is
elected by the Company Stockholders. The Representative may be removed at any
time, and a successor representative, reasonably satisfactory to Parent, may
be appointed, pursuant to written action by the Company Stockholders who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, held shares of Company Stock



51  constituting sixty six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) or more of all such
shares. Any successor to the Representative shall, for purposes of
this Agreement, be deemed to be, from the time of the appointment thereof in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Representative, and from and after such

refer to such successor. No appointment of a successor shall be effective
unless such successor agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement.

other advisors and shall promptly notify Parent after retaining any
such person. The Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement by Parent
of his reasonable out of pocket expenses including the reasonable, documented
fees and expenses incurred by the Representative for payment to, or in
connection with, the retention of such counsel, consultants, accounting or
financial, or other advisors, not to exceed $20,000 per Contingent Payment,

exercise thereof or of any other rights. Except as otherwise provided
hereunder, all rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are

nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the



53  original intent of the parties as closely as possible, in a mutually
acceptable manner, to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this

10.12. Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California as applied to
contracts that are executed and performed in California, without regard to the
principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each party hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in

with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or
proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is improper. Each party
hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process
being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof
to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement
