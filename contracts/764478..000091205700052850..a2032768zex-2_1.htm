AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the _"Agreement"_ ) is made and entered into as of December 6, 2000, by and among Best Buy Co., Inc., a Minnesota corporation ( _"Parent"_ ), EN Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation ( _"Merger Sub"_ ), and Musicland Stores Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( _"Company"_ ). 

   
 

Background

  

 A. The respective boards of directors of Company, Parent and Merger Sub have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 B. In furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause Merger Sub to make a tender offer (as such tender offer may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the _"Offer"_ ) to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company, together with the associated Company Rights (the _"Company Common Stock"_ ), at a purchase price of $12.55 per share (such price, or any greater amount paid per share of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, herein referred to as the _"Offer Price"_ ), net to the seller in cash, without interest on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 C. The respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have approved the merger (the _"Merger"_ ) of Merger Sub with and into Company following the consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued share of Company Common Stock not owned by Parent, Merger Sub or Company, other than Appraisal Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash; 

  

 D. To induce Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of Company (the _"Principal Stockholders"_ ) have executed a stockholder support agreement (the _"Stockholder Agreement"_ ) with Parent contemporaneously herewith. 

  

 E. To induce Parent to enter into this Agreement, Company has granted to Merger Sub an option to purchase such number of shares of Company Common Stock as described in, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of, a "top-up" option agreement (the _"Top-Up Option Agreement"_ ) executed contemporaneously herewith. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows: 

   
 

ARTICLE I 
THE OFFER

  

 Section 1.1 The Offer. 

  

 (a) _ Commencement of Offer._ Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Article VIII, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in no event later than December 27, 2000, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to and Merger Sub shall commence the Offer within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the _"SEC"_ ). Subject to the conditions of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall use all reasonable efforts to consummate, or cause to be consummated, the Offer. The obligation of Merger Sub, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub, to consummate the Offer and to accept for payment and to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered shall be subject to only those conditions to the offer set forth in _Annex A_ (any of which may be waived by Merger Sub or Parent in its sole discretion) (the _"Conditions to the Offer"_ ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent of Company, neither Merger Sub nor Parent shall waive or amend the Minimum Tender Condition (as 

    defined in _Annex A_). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer, Merger Sub will accept for payment and pay for, as soon as permitted
under the terms of the Offer, all shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer.

  

 (b) _ Expiration._ The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th) business day after the date of commencement of the Offer. Without the prior written consent of Company, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall (i) reduce the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable pursuant to the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought pursuant to the Offer, (iv) modify the conditions of the Offer in a manner adverse to holders of Company Common Stock, (v) impose additional conditions to the Offer, (vi) waive or amend the Minimum Tender Condition, or (vii) amend any other term of the Offer in any manner adverse to holders of Company Common Stock. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub agree that Merger Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the Offer or, except as provided in this Section 1.1(b), extend the expiration date of the Offer unless at the expiration date of the Offer the conditions to the Offer described in _Annex A_ hereto shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived. If at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer described in _Annex A_ hereto shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived but, in the reasonable belief of Parent, may be satisfied prior to May 31, 2001 (the _"Drop Dead Date"_ ), Merger Sub may extend the expiration date of the Offer for an additional period or periods of time until the earlier of (i) the date such conditions are satisfied or earlier waived and Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer or (ii) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. Each extension of the Offer pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be for a period of no more than ten (10) business days. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 1.1(b) to the contrary, if at the expiration date of the Offer the conditions to the Offer described in _Annex A_ have been satisfied or earlier waived, but there have been validly tendered and not withdrawn a number of shares of Company Common Stock which represents fewer than ninety percent (90%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the expiration of the Offer, then Merger Sub may extend the Offer for one (1) or more periods of no more than three (3) business days each, not to exceed twenty (20) business days in the aggregate; provided, however, that if Merger Sub extends the Offer pursuant to this sentence, Parent and Merger Sub shall waive during such period all conditions of the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ other than (i) the Minimum Tender Condition and (ii) the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of _Annex A_ solely to the extent that Parent or Merger Sub would violate any Law, or injunction, writ or order in purchasing shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. If on any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer described in _Annex A_ shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived but, in the reasonable belief of the Company, may be satisfied prior to the Drop Dead Date, then, if requested by the Company, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to and Merger Sub shall extend the Offer one or more times for an additional period or periods of time until the earlier of (i) the date such conditions are satisfied or earlier waived and Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, (ii) the date twenty (20) business days after the applicable waiting period under HSR has expired or been terminated or (iii) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (c) _ SEC and Delaware Filings for Tender Offer._ As soon as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC and the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer which shall contain, among other things, an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal and other ancillary documents (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, are referred to herein collectively as the _"Offer Documents"_ ). Parent shall deliver copies of the proposed forms of the Offer Documents to Company within a reasonable time prior to the commencement of the Offer for review and comment by Company and its counsel. Parent agrees to provide to Company and its counsel in 

    writing any comments that Merger Sub, Parent or their counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
the receipt thereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any
information in the Offer Documents that shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect and take all steps necessary to cause such Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the _"Exchange Act"_ ). Parent shall
deliver copies of the proposed form of corrected Offer Documents to Company
within a reasonable time prior to their filing or dissemination for review
and comment by Company and its counsel.

  

 (d) _ Parent Funding._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 (e) _ Assignment._ Merger Sub may, at any time, transfer or assign to one (1) or more corporations directly or indirectly wholly owned by Parent the right to purchase all or any portion of the Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, but no such transfer or assignment shall relieve Parent or the Merger Sub of their obligations under the Offer or prejudice the rights of tendering stockholders to receive payment for Company Common Stock properly tendered and accepted for payment. 

  

 Section 1.2 Company Actions. 

  

 (a) _ Consent to Offer, Merger and Transactions._ Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _ Filings; Board Recommendation; Stockholder Communication._ In accordance with Rule 14d-9(e) under the Exchange Act, Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to time and including the exhibits thereto, the _"Schedule 14D-9"_), containing the determinations and recommendations described in Section 3.3(b), and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 as required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the determinations and recommendations referred to in Section 3.3(b). Company shall deliver the proposed forms of the Schedule 14D-9 to Parent within a reasonable time prior to the commencement of the Offer for review and comment by Parent and its counsel. Company agrees to provide to Parent and its counsel in writing any comments that Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt thereof. Company shall promptly correct any information in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Company shall deliver copies of the proposed form of the corrected Schedule 14D-9 to Parent within a reasonable time prior to their filing or dissemination for review and comment by Parent and its counsel. 

  

 (c) _ Information and Materials to Parent._ In connection with the Offer, Company shall furnish to Parent, or cause to be furnished through its transfer agent or other representatives, mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent date and shall furnish Parent with such information and assistance (including updated security position listings and other available listings or computer files of record holders) as Parent or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial stockholders of Company. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of their affiliates to, hold the information contained in any of such labels, lists and files in confidence, use such information only in connection with the 

    Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated, deliver to
Company all copies of such information and extracts therefrom then in their
possession or under their control.

  

 (d) _ Parent Board Appointments; Powers of the Board._ The appointment of Parent representatives to the Company Board, the obligations of the Company with respect thereto and the approvals required until the Effective Time shall be governed by Section 5.4 of this Agreement.

 (i) Any shares of Company Common Stock acquired upon exercise of outstanding and vested options (each, a _"Company Option"_ ) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any of the Company\'s 1988 Stock Option Plan, 1992 Stock Option Plan, 1994 Stock Option Plan, 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, or Stock Option Plan for Unaffiliated Directors (collectively, the _"Company Stock Option Plans"_ ) prior to the expiration of the Offer and duly tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be purchased by the Merger Sub in connection with its purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. 

  

 (ii) Parent and the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to provide that, effective as of the Effective Time, (A) each outstanding Company Option which has an exercise price below the amount of the Merger Consideration (the _"In the Money Options"_ ), whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and (B) in consideration of such cancellation, Parent shall, or shall cause the Merger Sub to, pay to the holders of the In the Money Options as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in respect of each such Company Option equal to the product of (x) the excess of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of each such Company Option and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (such payment to be net of applicable withholding and excise taxes). 

  

 (iii) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company Option which is not an In the Money Option (each, an _"Out of the Money Option"_ ), whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent and converted into a fully vested option to purchase a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product, rounded to the nearest whole share, of (a) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the original Company Option and (b) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to (x) the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock originally issuable pursuant to such Company Option divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for any such option to which Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the _"Code"_ ), applies, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. Each Out of the Money Option assumed by Parent shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Option Plans and the agreements evidencing such options immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for the adjustments described above. Prior to the expiration of the Offer, Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of any option plan or arrangement) that are necessary and within its power to give effect to the transactions 

  

    

 contemplated by this Section 2.5. On the Closing Date, Company shall deliver
to Parent an updated Option Schedule current as of such date. Parent shall
take all corporate action necessary to reserve and make available for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
under Out of the Money Options assumed in accordance with this Section 2.5(d).
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms) which will register the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
assumed Out of the Money Options to the extent permitted by federal and state
securities Laws and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding. The term
_"Exchange Ratio"_ means the ratio of (y) the Offer Price to (z) the Parent
Measurement Price. The _"Parent Measurement Price"_ shall be determined by
dividing (i) the Total Weighted Trading Price by (ii) the Total Trading
Volume. The _"Total Weighted Trading Price"_ shall be the sum of the Weighted
Trading Prices for the period of the ten (10) trading days ending on the third
trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time (the _"Measurement
Period"_ ). The _"Weighted Trading Price"_ for any trading day shall be (i)
the Total Trading Volume multiplied by (ii) the closing sale price of one
share of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for such trading
day. The _"Total Trading Volume"_ shall be the sum of the daily volumes of
Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for each trading day during
the Measurement Period.

  

 (iv) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents of the holders of the Company Options as shall be necessary to effectuate the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, payment shall, at Parent\'s request, be withheld in respect of a Company Option until all necessary consents in respect of such Company Option are obtained. 

  

 (v) The provisions in any Benefit Plan other than the Company Stock Option Plans providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company shall be deleted as of the Effective Time. 

  

  

 Section 2.6 Surrender of Certificates. 

  

 (a) _ Payment Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the payment agent (the _"Payment Agent"_ ) in the Merger. 

  

 (b) _ Parent to Provide Merger Consideration._ At the Closing, Parent shall make available to the Payment Agent for payment in accordance with this Article II a cash amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.5, to be held by the Payment Agent for the benefit of and distributed to holders of such shares in accordance with this Agreement. The Payment Agent shall agree to hold such funds (the _"Payment Funds"_ ) for delivery as contemplated herein. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Payment Agent hereunder to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights as described in Section 2.10 have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand. The Payment Funds shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment Funds may be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States, (ii) commercial paper rated A-1, P-1 or A-2, P-2, and (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements and bankers acceptances of any bank or trust company organized under federal Law or under the Law of any state of the United States or the District of Columbia that has capital, surplus or undivided profits of at least $1,000,000,000 or in money market funds which are invested substantially in such investments. Any net earnings with respect thereto shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation as and when requested by the Surviving Corporation. If for any reason the Payment Funds are inadequate to pay the Merger Consideration, Parent shall remain liable and shall promptly make available to the Payment Agent additional funds for the 

    payment thereof. The Payment Funds shall not be used for any purpose except
as expressly provided in this Agreement.

  

 (c) _ Exchange Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record as of the Effective Time of a certificate or certificates (the _"Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock which were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and have such provisions as Parent shall reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the exchange of the Certificates for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.5, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificates. 

   

 In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to the transferee only if (i) the Certificates representing such shares of Company Common Stock surrendered to the Payment Agent in accordance with the terms hereof is properly endorsed for transfer or is accompanied by appropriate and properly endorsed stock powers and it is otherwise in proper form to effect such transfer, (ii) the person requesting such transfer pays to the Payment Agent any transfer or other Taxes payable by reason of such transfer or establishes to the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid, and (iii) such person establishes to the satisfaction of Parent that such transfer would not violate any applicable federal or state securities Laws. 

  

 (d) _ No Liability._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.6, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (e) _ Termination of Payment Agent._ Any Merger Consideration made available to the Payment Agent pursuant to this Section 2.6 which remains undistributed for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be returned by the Payment Agent to Parent, which shall thereafter act as Payment Agent, and thereafter any holder of unsurrendered Certificates shall look as a general creditor only to Parent for payment of any funds to which such holder may be due, subject to applicable Law. 

  

 Section 2.7 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger Consideration paid in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

  

 Section 2.8 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration; provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to such delivery, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such 

    sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

 Section 2.9 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled, or shall be entitled to cause the Payment Agent, to deduct and withhold from the amounts payable pursuant to the Offer and the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Payment Agent, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Payment Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 Section 2.10 Appraisal Rights. 

  

 (a) _ Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the _"Appraisal Shares"_ ) of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of Delaware Law shall not be converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of Delaware Law. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of Delaware Law. 

  

 (b) _ Loss of Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 2.10, if any holder who exercises appraisal rights under Section 262 of the Delaware Law shall effectively withdraw or lose such rights, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder automatically shall be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.5, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares. 

  

 (c) _ Parent Rights._ Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any written demands for payment under Section 262 of the Delaware Law, withdrawals of such demands and any other related instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware Law received by Company and a true, correct and complete copy thereof, and (ii) the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment under Section 262 of the Delaware Law. Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for payment and shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent and Merger Sub, settle or offer to settle any such demands.

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, assuming the

As of the date of this Agreement, there is no judgment, decree or order against Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of Company, any of their respective directors or officers (in their capacities as such), that could prevent, enjoin, or materially alter or delay any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may be
reasonably expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, or (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a Company Takeover
Proposal; provided, however, that, at any time during the period following
the execution of this Agreement and prior to consummation of the Offer, if the
Company receives a proposal or offer that was not solicited by the Company or
a Company Representative and that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) could result in a third party making a
Superior Proposal, and subject to compliance with Section 6.1(b), the Company
Board (if it has determined in good faith after consulting with its outside
legal counsel that its fiduciary duties require it to do so) may, or may
authorize the Company Representatives, to (x) furnish information with respect
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such
proposal or offer pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no more
favorable to such person than those contained in the Mutual Nondisclosure,
Nonsolicitation and Exclusivity Agreement dated August 31, 2000 between
Parent and Company (the _"Nondisclosure Agreement"_ ), and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such proposal or offer. For purposes of
this Agreement, _"Company Takeover Proposal"_ means any inquiry, proposal or
offer for a merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, recapitalization
or other business combination involving Company or any Company Subsidiary, any
proposal or offer for the issuance by the Company of over 15% of its equity
securities as consideration for the assets or securities of any person, or any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 15%
of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company, in each
case, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes
of this Agreement, _"Superior Proposal"_ means any proposal made by a third
party to acquire all or substantially all of the equity securities or assets
of the Company, pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, merger, a
consolidation, a liquidation or dissolution, a recapitalization, a sale of its
assets or otherwise, which a majority of the disinterested directors of the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (i) to be on terms
superior in value from a financial point of view to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after consultation with the Company\'s independent financial advisor),
taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to increase the Offer Price or
otherwise amend the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
(ii) is not subject to a financing condition unless the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors, that such proposal is reasonably capable of being financed and (iii)
is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violations of the restrictions set forth
in this paragraph by any officer, director, financial advisor, attorney,
representative, subsidiary or agent of Company, whether or not acting on
behalf of Company, or authorized to act on behalf of the Company, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.1 by Company.

  

 (b) Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in any case prior to providing any information or access referred to below) after receipt by Company (or any Company Representative) of any Company Takeover Proposal or any request for non-public information in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of Company or any Company Subsidiary by any person or entity that informs Company that it is considering making, or has made, a Company Takeover Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact. Company shall continue to keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status of any such discussions or negotiations and the terms being discussed or negotiated. 

  

 (c) Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations by Company or any Company Representative with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal, take the necessary steps to inform such parties of the 

    obligations undertaken in this Section 6.1, and request that such parties
promptly return all documents (and all copies thereof) furnished to them by
Company or its representatives in connection with such activities,
discussions and negotiations that embody any non-public information of
Company.

   

 (d) Neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation of the Company Board of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, a Company Takeover Proposal, unless a withdrawal or modification of such approval or recommendation is, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, necessary to comply with its fiduciary obligations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to the Company\'s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law. 

  

 (e) In addition to the rights of termination provided for in Article VIII of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated by the Company prior to consummation of the Offer, if (i) the Company is not in material breach of this Section 6.1, (ii) the Company Board authorizes the Company, subject to complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a binding written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company gives Parent notice (which may be revoked by the Company by a subsequent notice to that effect) in writing that it intends to enter into such agreement, attaching the most current version of such agreement to such notice, and (iii) Parent does not make, within four (4) business days of receipt of the Company\'s written notification of its intention to enter into a binding agreement for a Superior Proposal, an offer that the Company Board determines, in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors, is at least as favorable from the financial point of view, to the stockholders of the Company as the Superior Proposal. The Company agrees (x) that it will not enter into the binding agreement referred to in clause (ii) above until at least the fifth (5th) business day after it has provided notice (which has not been revoked) to Parent required thereby, and (y) to notify Parent promptly if its intention to enter into a written agreement referred to in its notification shall change at any time after giving such notification. 

  

 Section 6.2 Access to Information. 

  

 (a) Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to (i) all of Company\'s and the Company Subsidiaries\' properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, (ii) all of Company\'s and the Company Subsidiaries\' exempt (salaried) non-store employees who are employed at the level of director or above, advisers, representatives and agents, and (iii) all other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of Company and the Company Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request, subject to legally binding confidentiality restrictions with third parties in effect as of the date of this Agreement, in each case, for the purpose of confirming the representations and warranties of Company made herein and the performance by Company of all covenants to be performed by Company hereunder and for integration planning. Company agrees to provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of internal financial statements promptly upon reasonable request. Parent agrees that such requests will not interfere with normal seasonal operations of the Company. 

  

 (b) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of Parent and Company shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more representatives of the other party to report operational matters of materiality and the general status of ongoing operations. 

     (c) The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed after the date of
this Agreement pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities
Laws.

  

 (d) No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger. 

  

 Section 6.3 Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge that Parent and Company have previously executed the Nondisclosure Agreement, the confidentiality provisions of which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 Section 6.4 Public Disclosure. Unless otherwise permitted by this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub, and Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement or making any other public (or non-confidential) disclosure (whether or not in response to an inquiry) regarding the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither shall issue any such press release or make any such statement or disclosure without the prior approval of the other (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as may be required by applicable Law or to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC or any obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. 

  

 Section 6.5 Consents; Cooperation. 

  

 (a) Each of Parent and Company shall promptly apply for or otherwise seek, and use all reasonable efforts to obtain, all consents and approvals required to be obtained by it for the consummation of the Offer and the Merger, including those required under HSR, and shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under, or to deliver notice of the Merger as required by, any of its material contracts in connection with the Merger for the assignment thereof or otherwise. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to HSR or any other federal or state antitrust or fair trade Law. 

  

 (b) Each of Parent and Company shall use all reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under HSR, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other Federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, _"Antitrust Laws"_ ). In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and Company shall cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to contest and resist vigorously any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent (each an _"Order"_ ), that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any such other transactions, unless by mutual agreement Parent and Company decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests. Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither Parent nor Company shall have any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any Order beyond the earlier of (i) May 30, 2001, or (ii) the date of a ruling preliminarily enjoining the Merger issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each of Parent and Company shall use all reasonable efforts to take such action 

    as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under HSR
or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement.

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Company shall be required to agree, as a condition to any required approval of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, to divest itself of or hold separate any subsidiary, division or business unit that is material to the business of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the divestiture or holding separate of which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on (A) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) the benefits intended to be derived as a result of the Merger. 

  

 Section 6.6 Update Disclosure; Breaches. From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to Company, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, Company shall provide to Parent true, accurate and complete copies of any amendment to or revisions of the DLJ Opinion. The delivery of any notice or document pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. 

  

 Section 6.7 Indemnification. 

  

 (a) The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in Article IV of the certificate of incorporation of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, unless such modification shall be required by Law, and during such period Parent agrees that the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of each Company Subsidiary shall provide for the same rights as provided under such Article IV for all persons standing in a comparable relationship to any Company Subsidiary. 

  

 (b) From and after the consummation of the Offer, each of Parent and Company, and from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law or the Company\'s certificate of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date of this Agreement, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer, employee and agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, together with each person\'s heirs, executors or administrators, an _"Indemnified Party"_ and collectively, the _"Indemnified Parties"_ ) against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorney\'s fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to occur prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company) or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance 

    maintained by the Company and Company Subsidiaries (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies from reputable and financially sound carriers of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties) with respect to claims
arising from and related to facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to make
premium payments for such insurance in excess of $700,000 per year (the
"Maximum Premium"). If such insurance coverage can only be obtained at an
annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the
most advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

  

 (d) In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any successor to the Surviving Corporation or Parent (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors of the Surviving Corporation honor the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and Parent set forth in this Section 6.7. 

  

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties. 

  

 Section 6.8 Legal Requirements. Each of Parent and Company will, and will cause their respective subsidiaries to, take all reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on them with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to any party hereto necessary in connection with any such requirements imposed upon such other party in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with the other parties hereto in obtaining) any consent, approval, order or authorization of, or any registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or other person, required to be obtained or made in connection with the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.9 Additional Agreements; Reasonable Efforts. Each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the appropriate vote of the stockholders of Company described in Section 5.5, if applicable, including cooperating fully with the other parties, including by provision of information. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of the constituent corporations, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action. 

  

 Section 6.10 Employee Benefits. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their respective terms (as in effect on the date of this Agreement), all the Company\'s employment, severance and termination agreements, plans and policies disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (b) If prior to the Effective Time Parent agrees to grant options to acquire Parent\'s Common Stock to any officer or director of the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent, or any appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall if necessary adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the acquisition by any officer or director of the Company who may become a covered person of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of 

    the Exchange Act ( _"Section 16"_) of options to acquire Parent Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16\.

  

 (c) For a period of not less than one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the _"Company Employees"_ ), taken as a whole, employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those described on Schedule 6.10(c) attached to the Company Disclosure Letter in connection with Section 6.10(c) thereof and provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to non-officer Company Employees as of the date of this Agreement (it being understood that Company Employees who are officers of the Company and Company Subsidiaries shall be eligible hereunder only for the employee benefits available to non-officer Company Employees and that any additional benefits available to Company Employees who are officers will be considered by Parent at its sole discretion). 

  

 (d) The Company shall (i) make required contributions to its Capital Accumulation Plan in the normal course consistent with past practice in January 2001 with respect to fiscal year 2000 service, (ii) prior to December 31, 2000, freeze all participation and benefit accruals under the Musicland Group, Inc. Employees\' Retirement Plan, and (iii) prior to December 31, 2000, terminate its Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

  

 (e) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the _"New Plans"_ ), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its affiliates before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled before the Effective Time to credit for such service under any similar Company Plans. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plans replaces coverage under a comparable Company Plan, in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time and previously described to Parent (such plans, collectively, the _"Old Plans"_ ) ; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all preexisting condition exclusions and actively at work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for all such employees and his or her covered dependents (other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and dependents and are not satisfied as of the Effective Time), and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out of pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

  

 (f) Subject to compliance by Parent with its obligations under Section 6.10(a) and 6.10(c), nothing contained in this Section 6.10 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent (i) the termination of employment of any individual Company Employee, (ii) any change in the employee benefits available to any individual Company Employee, (iii) the amendment or termination of any particular Company Plan to the extent permitted by its terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, or (iv) limiting, in whole or in part, bridging of service on a prospective basis under the New Plans.

 (j) by the Company if any event occurs which would result in the conditions set forth in paragraphs (e) or (f) of Annex A not being satisfied, and ten (10) business days have elapsed since such occurrence, unless Parent shall have waived its right to terminate this Agreement and its right not to consummate the Offer for the failure of such condition resulting from such event.

 Section 9.4 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the exhibits, the schedules, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the Nondisclosure Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect and shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing, in accordance with its terms; and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, except for the rights of the Company stockholders and optionholders to receive the consideration set forth in Article I of this Agreement and the provisions of Sections 6.7 and 6.10.

CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER

  

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to applicable Law, pay for any shares of Company Common Stock not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for, unless (i) there shall be validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer a number of shares of Company Common Stock which represents at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the Fully Diluted Shares (the _"Minimum Tender Condition"_ ), and (ii) any applicable waiting period under HSR shall have expired or been terminated. _"Fully Diluted Shares"_ means all outstanding securities entitled to vote on the Merger on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the exercise or conversion of all options, rights and securities exercisable or convertible into such voting securities, other than the potential dilution attributable to the Company Rights and shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Top-Up Option Agreement. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to applicable Law, pay for any shares of Company Common Stock not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for, if at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and before the acceptance of such shares of Company Common Stock for payment or payment therefor, any one or more of the following conditions exists: 

  

 (a) Action or Proceeding. There shall be pending any suit, action or proceeding that has a reasonable likelihood of success brought by any Governmental Authority against Parent, Company or any of their respective subsidiaries (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, materially delay or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, any shares of Company Common Stock by Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger, or seeking to obtain damages in connection with any such transactions that would result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company, (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit the ownership or operation by Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries of all or any material portion of the business or assets of Company and its subsidiaries, Parent or any of its subsidiaries, or to compel Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of their respective business, as a result of the Offer, or the Merger; (iii) seeking to impose limitations on the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent to acquire or hold, or exercise effectively full rights of ownership of, any shares of Company Common Stock acquired by Merger Sub in the Offer or the Merger, including the right to vote any shares of Company Common Stock on matters properly presented to the stockholders of Company, including the approval and adoption of the Agreement, the plan of merger included in the Certificate of Merger, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby; or (iv) seeking to prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from effectively controlling in any respect the business or operations of Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) New Law or Injunction. There shall have been promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger, by any Governmental Authority, any Law (other than HSR), or there shall have been issued any injunction, order or decree by any Governmental Authority, which (i) restrains or prohibits the making of the Offer or the consummation of the Merger; (ii) prohibits or limits ownership or operation by Company, Parent or Merger Sub of all or any material portion of the business or assets of Company or any Company Subsidiary, or compels Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case as a result of the consummation of the Offer, or the Merger; (iii) imposes limitations on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to exercise effectively full rights of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock acquired by Merger Sub in the Offer or the Merger, including the right to vote any such shares on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of Company, including the approval and adoption of the Agreement, the plan of merger included in the Certificate of Merger, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby; or (iv) requires divestiture by Parent or Merger Sub of any shares of Company Common Stock acquired by Merger Sub in the Offer or the Merger.   (c) Representations and Warranties. Any representation or warranty of
Company in the Agreement (which for purposes of this clause (c) shall be read
as though none of them contained any Material Adverse Effect or materiality
qualifications) shall not be true and correct in all respects in each case as
of the date of the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, as such date may be
extended in accordance with the Agreement (other than representations and
warranties made as of a specified date) and the failure to be true and
correct, when taken together with all other such failures of the
representations and warranties of Company in the Agreement (other than
representations and warranties made as of a specified date) to be true and
correct in all respects, in the aggregate, has had or would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company;

  

 (d) Agreements and Covenants. Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or covenant of Company to be performed or complied with by it under the Agreement.

 (f) Trading Limitations. There shall have occurred and continued to exist any general suspension of, or limitation on, trading in securities on any national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market in the United States (other than any suspension or limitation on trading in any particular security as a result of a computerized trading limit or any intraday suspension due to "circuit breakers"). 

  

 (g) Actions of Federal Reserve Board or Federal Governmental Authority. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board or any other federal Governmental Authority shall have declared a general banking moratorium or general suspension of payments in respect of banks or any limitation (whether or not mandatory) on the extension of credit by banks or other lending institutions in the United States. 

  

 (h) Other Change. Except as disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents or the Company Disclosure Letter, since the date of this Agreement there shall have occurred any change, event or development which, either individually or in the aggregate, would or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. 

  

 (i) Termination. The Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

   

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Merger Sub and Parent and may be asserted by Merger Sub or Parent or may be waived by Merger Sub or Parent in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion; provided that the Minimum Tender Condition may not be waived or amended without the prior written consent of Company. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

   

 Should the Offer be terminated pursuant to the foregoing provisions, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock not theretofore accepted for payment shall forthwith be returned by the Payment Agent to the tendering stockholders.
