W I T N E S S E T H:

 

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Company, Parent and Merger Sub have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Company will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into, Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "), with Merger Sub as the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Company_ ");

 

 WHEREAS, prior to the Merger, Merger Sub shall be converted into a Delaware limited liability company;

 

 WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

 

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

Merger Sub shall be the Surviving Company in the Merger and shall continue its existence as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease.

 

 (b) Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the combination (including by providing for the merger of Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

 2.1 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company Subsidiary of Parent or another bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company, or Parents transfer agent, pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_") to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder.

 

 2.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) authorize the Exchange Agent to issue an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited with, the Exchange Agent, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(f) (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. 

 

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates)) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of_ _Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(c). 

 

 (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II. 

 

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate. 

 

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of Company, the fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Merger Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be 

  in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance
shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier
of (x) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time and (y) the expiration
or termination of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case
may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment.
To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as
the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent,
as the case may be.

 

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. 

 

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the average, rounded to the nearest one ten thousandth, of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4. 

 

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Company as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be paid to Parent. In such event, any former stockholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest 

  thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company,
the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

 

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of the business of Company and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity has initiated since January 1, 2005 or has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to the

   knowledge of Company, investigation into the business, disclosures or
operations of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2005, no
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity has resolved any proceeding,
enforcement action or, to the knowledge of Company, investigation into the
business, disclosures or operations of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
There is no unresolved, or, to Companys knowledge, threatened criticism,
comment, exception or stop order by any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since
January 1, 2005, there have been no formal or informal inquiries by, or
disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity with respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than normal examinations conducted
by a Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity in Companys ordinary
course of business).

 

  (b) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party
to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding
with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is
subject to any order or directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil
money penalty by, or has been since January 1, 2005 a recipient of any
supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2005 has adopted any policies,
procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of, any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that currently restricts in
any material respect the conduct of its business (or to Companys knowledge
that, upon consummation of the Merger, would restrict in any material respect
the conduct of the business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), or that
in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay
dividends, its credit, risk management or compliance policies, its internal
controls, its management or its business, other than those of general
application that apply to similarly situated savings and loan holding
companies or their Subsidiaries (each item in this sentence, a " _Company
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has Company or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised since January 1, 2005 by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting
any such Company Regulatory Agreement. To the knowledge of Company, there has
not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2005 that would result in a
determination that Countrywide Bank, fsb is not "well capitalized" as a matter
of U.S. federal banking law.

 

  (c) Company has previously made available to Parent an accurate and
complete copy of each (i) final registration statement, prospectus, report,
schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") since
January 1, 2005 (the " _Company SEC Reports_ ") and prior to the date of this
Agreement and (ii) communication mailed by Company to its stockholders since
January 1, 2005 and prior to the date of this Agreement. No such Company SEC
Report or communication, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and,
in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of
effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date
of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier
date. As of their respective dates, all Company SEC Reports complied as to
form in all material respects

  with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. Each
current Subsidiary of Company that has filed since January 1, 2005 a Form S-3
registration statement with the SEC meets the requirements for the use of Form
S-3, and no event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in
Form S-3 eligibility requirements no longer being satisfied by any such
Subsidiary. No executive officer of Company has failed in any respect to make
the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ").

 

 3.6 _Financial Statements_. 

 

 (a) The financial statements of Company and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in stockholders equity and consolidated financial position of Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to recurring year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. KPMG LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountants of Company as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Company on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure. 

 

 (b) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent, determined, determinable or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Company included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2007 (including any notes thereto) and (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2007 or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

 

 (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Company and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below in this Section 3.6(c). Company (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial 

   officer of Company by others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Companys
outside auditors and the audit committee of Companys Board of Directors (i)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in
Companys internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were
made in writing by management to Companys auditors and audit committee, a
copy of which has previously been made available to Parent. As of the date
hereof, there is no reason to believe that Companys outside auditors, chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 

  (d) Since December 31, 2006, (i) neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of Company, any director, officer,
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Company or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Company
or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Company.

 

  3.7 _Broker s Fees_. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents has utilized
any broker, finder or financial advisor or incurred any liability for any
brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than as set forth
on Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and pursuant to letter
agreements, true, complete and correct copies of which have been previously
delivered to Parent.

expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Company. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse
Effect_ " means, with respect to Parent or Company, as the case may be, a
material adverse effect on (i) the financial condition, results of operations
or business of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), a " _Material Adverse
Effect_ " shall not be deemed to include effects to the extent resulting from
(A) changes, after the date hereof, in GAAP or regulatory accounting
requirements applicable generally to companies in the industries in which such
party and its Subsidiaries operate, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in
laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in the
industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, (C) actions or
omissions taken with the prior written consent of the other party, (D)

to clauses (A) and (B), to the extent that the effects of such change are
disproportionately adverse to the financial condition, results of operations
or business of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared
to other companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Agreement, Company and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of business
consistent with their past practice.

Subsidiaries has (i) except for (A) normal increases for or payments to

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the "Executive Officers")) made in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or (B) as required
by applicable law or contractual obligations existing as of the date hereof,

other than the customary year-end bonuses in amounts consistent with past
practice, (ii) granted any options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock,
any restricted shares of Company Common Stock or any right to acquire any
shares of its capital stock, or any right to payment based on the value of

Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of
Companys knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions, suits or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to
which any of their assets are subject.

 

  (b) There is no judgment, settlement agreement, order, injunction,
decree or regulatory restriction (other than those of general application that
apply to similarly situated savings and loan holding companies or their
Subsidiaries) imposed upon Company, any of its

  Subsidiaries or the assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or that,
upon consummation of the Merger, would apply to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries).

 

 3.10 _Taxes and Tax Returns_. 

 

 (a) Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all such Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects), has paid all Taxes shown thereon as arising and has duly paid or made provision for the payment of all material Taxes that have been incurred or are due or claimed to be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local taxing authorities other than Taxes that are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith, have not been finally determined and have been adequately reserved against under GAAP. The federal, California and New York state income Tax returns of Company and its Subsidiaries have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") or other relevant taxing authority for all years to and including the years ending December 2004, December 2001 and February 2001, respectively, and any liability with respect thereto has been satisfied or any liability with respect to deficiencies asserted as a result of such examination is covered by reserves that are adequate under GAAP. There are no material disputes pending, or written claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon Company or any of its Subsidiaries for which Company does not have reserves that are adequate under GAAP. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Company and its Subsidiaries). Within the past five years (or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part), neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code, no such adjustment has been proposed by the IRS and no pending request for permission to change any accounting method has been submitted by Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The aggregate balance of the reserve for bad debts described in any provision under state or local laws and regulations similar to Section 593(g)(2)(A)(ii) of the Code of Company and its Subsidiaries is not greater than $1,000,000. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

 3.11 _Employee Matters_. 

 

 (a) Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct list of each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), whether or not subject to ERISA, and each employment, consulting, bonus, incentive or deferred compensation, vacation, stock option or other equity-based, severance, termination, retention, change of control, profit-sharing, fringe benefit or other similar plan, program, agreement or commitment, whether written or unwritten, for the benefit of any employee, former employee, director or former director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries entered into, maintained or contributed to by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to contribute, or with respect to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, direct or indirect, contingent or otherwise (including any liability arising out of an indemnification, guarantee, hold harmless or similar agreement) or otherwise providing benefits to any current, former or future employee, officer or director of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to any beneficiary or dependant thereof (such plans, programs, agreements and commitments, herein referred to as the " _Company Benefit Plans_ "). 

 

 (b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, Company has made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of the following (as applicable): (i) the written document evidencing such Company Benefit Plan or, with respect to any such plan that is not in writing, a written description of the material terms thereof; (ii) the summary plan description; (iii) the most recent annual report, financial statement and/or actuarial report; (iv) the most recent determination letter from the IRS; (v) the most recent Form 5500 required to have been filed with the IRS, including all schedules thereto; (vi) any related trust agreements, insurance contracts or documents of any other funding arrangements; (vii) any notices to or from the IRS or any office or representative of the Department of Labor relating to any compliance issues in respect of any such Company Benefit Plan; (viii) all amendments, modifications or material supplements to any Company Benefit Plan; and (ix) documents evidencing any discrimination or coverage tests performed during the last plan year. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing documents made available to Parent, there are no amendments to any Company Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor has Company or any of its Subsidiaries taken substantial steps to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new Company Benefit Plan. 

 

 (c) With respect to each of the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be subject to any liability that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Company and each of its Subsidiaries have operated and administered each Company Benefit Plan in compliance 

   with all applicable laws and the terms of each such plan. The terms of each
Company Benefit Plan are in compliance with all applicable laws. Each Company
Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401 and/or 409
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS to such
effect and, to the knowledge of Company, no fact, circumstance or event has
occurred or exists since the date of such determination letter that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Company Benefit Plan. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Company,
threatened or anticipated claims by, on behalf of or against any of the
Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries of such Company Benefit Plan (with
respect to whom Company has an indemnification obligation) with respect to
their duties to any Company Benefit Plan, or against the assets of such
Company Benefit Plan or any trust maintained in connection with such Company
Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits). All contributions,
premiums and other payments required to be made with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan have been made on or before their due dates under applicable law
and the terms of such Company Benefit Plan, and with respect to any such
contributions, premiums or other payments required to be made with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan that are not yet due, to the extent required by
GAAP, adequate reserves are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of
Company included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2007 (including any notes thereto) or liability therefor
was incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since September 30, 2007. There is not now, and to the knowledge of Company
there are no existing circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give
rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with respect to a
Company Benefit Plan or the imposition of any pledge, lien, security interest
or encumbrance on the assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates (as defined below) under ERISA or the Code,
or similar laws of foreign jurisdictions. No "excess contributions" have been
made that would be non-deductible or that would subject Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to the excise tax imposed under Section 4972 of the Code. To the
extent any Company Benefit Plan provides benefits in the form of, or permits
investment in, securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the interests
in such Company Benefit Plan are subject to a current, effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, or are subject to an exemption from
registration and the requirements of such exemption have been satisfied, and
the participants in such plan have been provided a current prospectus to
the extent required by applicable law.

 

  (d) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated, that, together with Company or any of
its Subsidiaries would be deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning
of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (an " _ERISA_   _Affiliate_ "), maintains or
contributes to, or during the five-year period prior to the date hereof
has maintained or contributed to, (x) any "employee benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is subject to Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or (y) a "multiemployer plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or a "multiple employer
plan" within the meaning of Sections 4063/4064 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of
the Code. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred, either
directly or indirectly (including as a result of any indemnification or joint
and several liability obligation), any liability pursuant to Title I or IV of
ERISA other than plan funding obligations in the ordinary course and Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") premiums (including any Controlled
Group Liability as a result of its relationship with an ERISA Affiliate) or
the penalty Tax, excise Tax or joint and several liability provisions of the
Code relating to employee benefit

  plans, whether contingent or otherwise, including pursuant to any non-exempt
"prohibited transactions" as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, and no event, transaction, fact or condition exists
that presents a risk to Company or any ERISA Affiliate of Company of incurring
any such liability, or after the Effective Time, to Parent or any of its
Affiliates, in each case, with respect to the Company Benefit Plans. No
Company Benefit Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not
waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.
With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a "multiemployer plan," no
complete or partial withdrawal from such plan has been made by Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or by any other person, that would reasonably be expected
to result in any material liability to Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether such liability is contingent or otherwise, and if Company or any of
its Subsidiaries were to withdraw from any such Company Benefit Plan, such
withdrawal would not result in any material liability to Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. During the five-year period prior to the date hereof, with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code (i) there has not been a partial
termination, and (ii) none of the following events has occurred: (x) the
filing of a notice of intent to terminate, (y) the treatment of an amendment
to such a Company Benefit Plan as a termination under Section 4041 of ERISA or
(z) the commencement of proceedings by the PBGC to terminate such a Company
Benefit Plan and (iii) there has been no "reportable event" within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations and interpretations thereunder
which required a notice to the PBGC which has not been fully and accurately
reported in a timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or not reported,
would constitute grounds for the PBGC to institute involuntary termination

any person alleging to be a current or former employee, any class of the
foregoing, or any Governmental Entity, relating to any such law or
regulation, or alleging breach of any express or implied contract of

obligations entered into by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder will not result in
Parent or any of its Affiliates (i) being bound by any Restrictive Covenant or
(ii) granting any rights or licenses to any Intellectual Property of Parent or
any of its Affiliates to any third party (including by means of a covenant
not to sue or cross-license). The consummation of the transactions

To the knowledge of Company, there is no reasonable basis for, or circumstances that are reasonably likely to give rise to, any such proceeding, claim, action, cause of action, notice, investigation, or remediation activities that would result in any such liability or obligation of Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any Governmental Entity or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to any of the foregoing.

Each such Statutory Statement presents fairly, in all material respects and in conformity with SAP, the statutory financial condition of such Insurance Subsidiary on the respective date of the Statutory Statement, the results of operations, changes in capital and surplus and cash flow of such Insurance Subsidiary for each of the applicable reporting periods, and was correct and complete when filed.

be established in accordance with applicable laws.

permitted by such laws.

 

  (e) All underwriting, management and administration agreements entered
into by any Insurance Subsidiary are, to the extent required by law, in forms
acceptable to all applicable Insurance Departments or have been filed with
and approved by all applicable Insurance Departments or were not objected to

  (f) All advertising, promotional, sales and solicitation materials and
all product illustrations used by any Insurance Subsidiary or any agent,
broker, intermediary, manager or producer employed or engaged by any
Insurance Subsidiary (each, a " _Producer_ ") of any Insurance Subsidiary are
in compliance with applicable laws.

 

  (g) Each reinsurance contract, treaty or arrangement (including any
facultative agreements, indemnity agreements, or other agreements involving
cession or assumption of reinsurance, coinsurance, excess insurance, or
retrocessions and any terminated or expired reinsurance contract, treaty or
agreement under which there remains any outstanding material liability) ("
_Reinsurance Contracts_ ") to which any Insurance Subsidiary is a party or by
which any Insurance Subsidiary is bound or subject is a valid and binding
obligation of the parties thereto, is in full force and effect, and is
enforceable in accordance with its terms. Neither any Insurance Subsidiary
nor, to the knowledge of Company, any other party thereto is in default with
regard to any such Reinsurance Contract. There are no disputes pending or, to
the knowledge of Company, threatened with respect to any such Reinsurance
Contract.

 

  (h) Each Insurance Subsidiary is entitled under applicable law to take
full credit in its Statutory Statements for all amounts recoverable by it
pursuant to any Reinsurance Contract, and all such amounts recoverable have
been properly recorded in the books and records of account of Company and its
Insurance Subsidiaries and are properly reflected in the Statutory Statements.
To Companys knowledge, all such amounts recoverable by Company or any of its
Insurance Subsidiaries are fully collectible in due course. Neither Company
nor any of its Insurance Subsidiaries has received notice that any other party
to any Reinsurance Contract

   intends not to perform fully under any such Reinsurance Contract, and, to

or has been engaged in, any pattern or practice of noncompliance with
applicable laws regarding such Producer\'s authority to engage in the type of
insurance activities in which such Producer is engaged, including laws
requiring such Producer to be duly licensed. To Companys knowledge, there is
no dispute pending or threatened against Company or any Insurance Subsidiary
by any Producer who individually accounted for more than five percent (5%) of
the aggregate gross written premiums of any Insurance Subsidiary during the
year ended December 31, 2007.

 

  (k) " _PMI Reinsurance Agreements_ " means all reinsurance agreements,
treaties, trust agreements and other agreements, and all amendments to any of
the foregoing, relating to any reinsurance assumed by any Insurance Subsidiary
(on an indemnity reinsurance basis or otherwise) of private mortgage
insurance written directly by any insurance company. Each PMI Reinsurance
Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of the parties thereto, is in full
force and effect, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms. Neither
any Insurance Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of Company, any other party
thereto is in default with regard to any PMI Reinsurance Agreement. There are
no material disputes pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened
with respect to any PMI Reinsurance Agreement.

 

  (l) The maximum liability of Company and any Insurance Subsidiary under
any PMI Reinsurance Agreement is limited to the amount of funds held in trust
under such PMI Reinsurance Agreement at such time as Company or such
Insurance Subsidiary may elect not to deposit additional funds in such trust.
Each Insurance Subsidiary has an absolute, unrestricted right to elect not to
deposit additional funds in any trust established pursuant to any PMI
Reinsurance Agreement, which election may be exercised at any time at the sole
discretion of such Insurance Subsidiary.

 

  (m) As of the date of this Agreement, each trust established pursuant
to any PMI Reinsurance Agreement is fully funded as required by such PMI
Reinsurance Agreement. Neither Company nor any Insurance Subsidiary has
received any written or oral notice, statement or other communication from any
person alleging or referencing any insufficiency in any such trust, demanding
further deposit in any such trust, or demanding payment of any benefits under
any PMI Reinsurance Agreement, and none of Company, the Insurance Subsidiaries
or the cedents under any Reinsurance Agreement has withdrawn at any time any
funds from any trust

   related to any of the PMI Reinsurance Agreements. Each Insurance Subsidiary
that is a party to any PMI Reinsurance Agreement has performed or received, on
no less than an annual basis, reconciliations of each trust account
established pursuant such PMI Reinsurance Agreement. Each Insurance Subsidiary
that is a party to any PMI Reinsurance Agreement has received all reports and
other information requested or due from the trustee(s) of each trust
established pursuant to such PMI Reinsurance Agreement and from the cedents
under any such PMI Reinsurance Agreement. Each Insurance Subsidiary that is a
party to any PMI Reinsurance Agreement has performed at least annual audits
of the reinsurance programs established in connection with such PMI
Reinsurance Agreements and of the cedents under such PMI Reinsurance
Agreements. No Insurance Subsidiary that is a party to any PMI Reinsurance
Agreement has transferred or ceded, in whole or in part, to any person any
insurance risk assumed by such Insurance Subsidiary under such PMI Reinsurance
Agreement. The reinsurance programs established in connection with the PMI
Reinsurance Agreements are not, and have not been, in violation of applicable
laws and such reinsurance programs have not been the subject of sanctions,
fines or penalties of any kind imposed by any Governmental Entity. To the
knowledge of Company, since January 1, 2005, the reinsurance

not, and have not been, the subject of any charges or allegations of any kind
of any violation of applicable laws.

 (b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability or obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2007 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2007 or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

    (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether

and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure

adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that

internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to Parents auditors and audit committee, a copy of

there is no reason to believe that Parents outside auditors, chief executive

certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

accounting or auditing practices, and (y) no attorney representing Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

 6.1 _Regulatory Matters_. (a) Parent and Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Company shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Company shall furnish all information concerning Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. 

 

 (b) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties (including any unions, works councils or other labor organizations) and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental Entities. Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance, 

   and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all
the information relating to Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with
respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require Parent to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to
any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties or
Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect (measured on a scale relative to Company) on either Parent or
Company (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ ").

 

  (c) Each of Parent and Company shall, upon request, furnish to the
other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

  (d) Each of Parent and Company shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any Parent Requisite Regulatory Approval or
Company Requisite Regulatory Approval, respectively, will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

 

  6.2 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, each of
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford
to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other
representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period, such
party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other
party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking or
insurance laws (other than reports or documents that such party is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may
reasonably request (in the case of a request by Company, information
concerning Parent that is reasonably related to the prospective value of
Parent Common Stock or to Parents ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby). Neither Company nor Parent, nor any of their
Subsidiaries, shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its

   Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 

  (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement
shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements entered
into between the parties as of November 12, 2007 and as of January 10, 2008
(the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ "). 

 

  (c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall
affect the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in this
Agreement. 

 

  6.3 _Stockholder Approval_. Company shall call a meeting of its
stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of
obtaining the requisite stockholder approval required in connection with the
Merger, on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting to
occur as soon as reasonably practicable. The Board of Directors of Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the
stockholder vote approving the Merger, on substantially the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Company shall submit this
Agreement to its stockholders at the stockholder meeting even if its Board of
Directors shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation. The
Board of Directors of Company has adopted resolutions approving the Merger, on
substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
directing that the Merger, on such terms and conditions, be submitted to
Companys stockholders for their consideration.

 

  6.4 _Affiliates_. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate"
(for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Company to deliver to

the date of the meeting of Company stockholders to be held pursuant to Section
6.3, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit A.

 

  6.5 _NYSE Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

  6.6 _Employee Matters_. (a) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall
maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities for the benefit of employees (as a group) who are actively
employed by Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (" _Covered
Employees_ ") that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities
which, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee
benefits and compensation opportunities that are generally made available to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than Company
and its Subsidiaries), as applicable; provided, that in no event shall any
Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of
Parent or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _further_ , that until such time as
Parent shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the benefit plans and
compensation opportunities that are made available to similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than Company and

   its Subsidiaries), a Covered Employees continued participation in employee
benefit plans and compensation opportunities of Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it
being understood that participation in the Parent plans may commence at
different times with respect to each Parent plan). Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, from and after the Effective Time, a
Covered Employee who is eligible to participate in the Company Change in
Control Severance Plan (the " _Company_ _Severance Plan_ ") and who is
terminated during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the second anniversary thereof shall be entitled to receive the severance
payments and benefits under the Company Severance Plan (without amendment to
the Company Severance Plan during such two year period following the
Effective Time).

 

  (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to
participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Company or its Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause
such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Covered
Employee with Company or its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) for
purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and, except under defined
benefit pension plans (other than as provided in the last sentence of this
Section 6.6(b)), benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent such service was recognized
immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit
Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Effective Time or, if there is no such comparable benefit plan,
to the same extent such service was recognized under the Company 401(k)
Savings and Investment Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided
that such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits
of a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service, and (ii)
with respect to any health, dental, vision plan or other welfare of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than Company and its Subsidiaries) in which any
Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the plan year in which such
Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, use its reasonable best
efforts to (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility
waiting periods under such Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived with
respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would have been
waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y)
recognize any health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Covered
Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in
which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of
any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under
any such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.
For purposes of any cash balance pension plan maintained or contributed to by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which Covered Employees become eligible
to participate following the Effective Time, the Covered Employees level of
benefit accruals under any such plans (for periods of service following the
date on which the Covered Employees commence participation in such plans)
shall be determined based on the Covered Employees credited service prior to
the Effective Time (as determined under Companys tax qualified retirement
plans immediately prior to the Effective Time) and with the Surviving Company
following the Effective Time.

 

  (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as
of the date hereof or as may be amended after the date hereof with the prior
written consent of Parent, each employment agreement and change in control
agreement listed on Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure

  Schedule and the obligations of Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time under each deferred compensation plan or agreement listed on
Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

 (d) Nothing in this Section 6.6 shall be construed to limit the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this Section 6.6 be construed to require the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time following the Closing Date. 

 

 (e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, the provisions of this Section 6.6 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for any purpose. 

 

 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

 

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "), including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their respective certificates or articles of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents), and any existing indemnification agreements set forth in Section 6.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or taken at the request of Parent pursuant to Section 6.8 hereof, it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall require any amendment to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Company. 

 

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, 

   costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement of or in connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and pertaining to
any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or
prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or
after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of Parent pursuant
to Section 6.8 hereof.

 

  (c) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and
directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective
Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by
Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors
in their capacity as such; provided that in no event shall Parent be required
to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the annual
premiums currently paid by Company (which current amount is set forth in
Section 6.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the "
_Insurance Amount_ "), and provided further that if Parent is unable to
maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the preceding
proviso, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for
the Insurance Amount.

 

  (d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

 

  6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the
one hand, and a Subsidiary of Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving
Company with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers
and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall,
at Parents sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Parent.

 

  6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and Company shall promptly
advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would
be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement; and _provided_ _further_ that a failure to
comply with this Section 6.9 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement
or the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied
unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would
independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to
be satisfied. 

  6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Company shall each take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, LLP. 

 

 6.11 _No Solicitation_. 

 

 (a) None of Company, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals, including the indication of any intention to propose any of the foregoing, being referred to herein as an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Company shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of Company stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.11 and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the person proposing such Alternative Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Company than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated November 12, 2007, to consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide Alternative Proposal received by Company, if and only to the extent that and so long as the Board of Directors of Company reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties to Company stockholders under applicable law. 

 

 As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Parent or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 15% of the outstanding shares of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to a merger with Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether from Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Parent or its affiliates) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of Company and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of Companys Subsidiaries) of Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 15% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such 

  transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided that, for purposes of Section 8.4, (A) each reference to "25%" in
clauses (i) and (iii) shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%" and (B) any
transaction contemplated by clauses (ii) or (iv) shall be limited to
transactions to which Company is a party and in which the stockholders of
Company immediately prior to the consummation thereof would not hold at least
66 2/3% of the total voting power of the surviving company in such transaction
or of its publicly traded parent corporation.

 

 (b) Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than any such request that does not relate to and would not reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to Parent shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Alternative Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and a copy (if in writing) and summary of the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to an Alternative Proposal. Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Alternative Proposal, indication or request. Company shall also provide Parent 24 hours written notice before it enters into any discussions or negotiations concerning any Alternative Proposal in accordance with Section 6.11(a). 

 

 (c) Company and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all persons other than Parent who have been furnished confidential information regarding Company in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. Company agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which Company or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make an Alternative Proposal. Neither Company nor the Board of Directors of Company shall approve or take any action to render inapplicable to any Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction Section 203 of the DGCL or any similar Takeover Statutes. 

 

 (d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.11(d), neither the Board of Directors of Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, the recommendation by the Board of Directors of Company of this Agreement and/or the Merger to Companys stockholders, (ii) take any public action or make any public statement in connection with the meeting of Company stockholder to be held pursuant to Section 6.3 inconsistent with such recommendation or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or fail to recommend against, any Alternative Proposal (any of the actions described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), a 

  " _Change of Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of Company may make a Change of Recommendation, if, and only if,
each of the following conditions is satisfied:

 

 (i) it receives a Alternative Proposal not solicited in breach of this Section 6.11 that constitutes a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has not been withdrawn;

 

 (ii) Company has not breached in any material respect any of the provisions set forth in Section 6.3 or this Section 6.11;

 

 (iii) it reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel), that in light of a Superior Proposal the failure to effect such Change of Recommendation would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties to Company stockholders under applicable law;

 

 (iv) Parent has received written notice from Company (a " _Change of Recommendation Notice_") at least five business days prior to such Change of Recommendation, which notice shall (1) state expressly that Company has received a Alternative Proposal which the Board of Directors of Company has determined is a Superior Proposal and that Company intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and the manner in which it intends or may intend to do so and (2) include the identity of the person making such Alternative Proposal and a copy (if in writing) and summary of material terms of such Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that any material amendment to the terms of such Alternative Proposal shall require a Change of Recommendation Notice and at least two business days prior to such Change of Recommendation; and

 

 (v) during any such notice period, Company and its advisors has negotiated in good faith with Parent to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Alternative Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

 

 As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means any proposal made by a third party (A) to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, 100% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or 100% of the assets, net revenues or net income of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (B) which is otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of Company determines in its reasonable good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, that the proposal, (i) if consummated would result in a transaction that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to Companys stockholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed, including to the extent required, financing which is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Company, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party.

  (e) Company shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other representatives) of Company or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this Section 6.11 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.11 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative) of Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.11 by Company. 

 

 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall prohibit Company or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

 

 6.12 _Restructuring Efforts_. If Company shall have failed to obtain the requisite vote or votes of its stockholders for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a duly held meeting of its stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, then, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, or the Tax treatment of the Merger, in a manner adverse to such party or its stockholders) and to resubmit the transaction to Companys stockholders for approval, with the timing of such resubmission to be determined at the reasonable request of Parent. 

 

 6.13 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and Company shall coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger. 

 

 6.14 _Tax Matters_. Company shall consult with Parent (including in connection with the preparation of Companys 2007 federal income Tax return) regarding Companys utilization of Tax losses and any issues that could reasonably be expected to give rise to creation of or increase in "net operating loss" carryforwards, and shall, in Companys reasonable discretion, take account of Parents views on such matters to the extent reasonably feasible.

    Ladies and Gentlemen: 
--- 

 

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an " _affiliate_ " of Countrywide Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Company_ "), as the term " _affiliate_ " is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 10, 2008 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), among Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Red Oak Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ") and Company, Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. 

 

 I represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that in the event I receive any Parent Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 

 

 (a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock in violation of the Securities Act or the Rules and Regulations. 

 

 (b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for Company. 

 

 (c) I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of Company I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Company and the distribution by me of Parent Common Stock has not been registered under the Securities Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Securities Act. 

  (d) I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. 

 

 (e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parents transfer agents with respect to Parent Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for Parent Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

 

"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the
requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under said
act or an exemption from such registration."

 

 (f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Parent Common Stock has been registered under the Securities Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: 

 

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the
meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

 

 It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to Parents transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have delivered to Parent (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are being or have been 

  transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule
145 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under
the Securities Act.

 

 I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest. 

 

 It is understood and agreed that this letter agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 

 

 Execution of this letter agreement should not be construed as an admission on my part that I am an " _affiliate_ " of Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter. 

 

    Very truly yours,
