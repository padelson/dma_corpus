iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of
February 11, 2007, among Verint Systems Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Buyer_ "), White Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Buyer (" _Acquisition Sub_ "), and Witness Systems,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

_R ECITALS _

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub
and the Company have determined that it is advisable and in the
best interests of their respective stockholders for the Buyer to acquire the
Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, it is intended that the Acquisition Sub will be merged with and
into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in
such merger (the " _Merger_ ").

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
(i) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interest of, the
Company and its stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ");
(iii) declared the advisability of this Agreement; and (iv) resolved to
recommend that the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock adopt
this Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the Buyer, the
Acquisition Sub and the Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Merger shall become effective upon the filing of a certificate
of merger, which shall be jointly prepared by the Buyer and the Company prior
to the Closing and which shall be in such form as is required by, and which
shall be executed by, the Company in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or at such later time as is established by the Buyer and
the Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

1.2 _Closing of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at 12 noon, Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the
Buyer and the Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than
the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in  _Article VII_ (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the
Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of
the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such    items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York, unless
another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the
Company. " _Business Day_ " shall be any day other than (a) a Saturday or
Sunday or (b) a day on which banking institutions located in New York, New
York are permitted or required by Law, executive order or governmental decree
to remain closed. At the Closing, each party shall deliver the agreements,
certificates and instruments required by the terms of this Agreement to be
delivered by it, and the Company shall cause the Certificate of Merger to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effect the Merger.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
of the Acquisition Sub shall cease and the Acquisition Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company (the Company following the Merger is sometimes
referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and (b) the
certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement shall be amended in its entirety in a manner mutually agreed by the
parties hereto consistent with Section 6.7, until further amended in
accordance with the DGCL. In addition, the Buyer shall cause the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to be amended and restated in their entirety so that,
immediately following the Effective Time, they are identical to the bylaws of
the Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that all references to the name of the Acquisition Sub therein shall be
changed to refer to the name of the Company and such bylaws shall otherwise
be consistent with _Section 6.7_, and, as so amended and restated, such
bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until further amended
in accordance with the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.4 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of the Acquisition
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Acquisition Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of the Acquisition Sub_. Each share of the common stock of
the Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ ") including the associated Preferred Stock Purchase Rights (the "
_Company Rights_ " and, together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Shares_
") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated  



 

6  as of October 25, 2002, between the Company and SunTrust Bank (the "
_Company Rights Plan_ ") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and
all Shares held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, the Buyer, the
Acquisition Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease
to exist and no stock of the Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section
2.2_, each Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 2.4(a)_
below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be automatically converted into the right to receive $27.50 (less applicable
withholding Taxes) in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the
Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest.

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
Shares for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit
with a bank or trust company mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Company
(the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through the Paying Agent
in accordance with this _Section 2.2_, cash in an amount sufficient to make
payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ in exchange
for all of the outstanding Shares (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Buyer. Any net profit
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such Exchange Fund will be
payable to the Buyer or as the Buyer otherwise directs and any loss resulting
from the investment of such Exchange Fund shall be borne by the Buyer and
shall not diminish any amount payable by the Buyer in exchange for the Shares
pursuant to this Agreement. 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-
entry form) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") entitled to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ a letter of transmittal in
customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger  



 

7  Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid,
promptly in exchange therefor, cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender of such Certificate or Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid and the Person
requesting such payment pays any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Buyer that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Section
2.2_. As used in this Agreement, " _Person_ " means any individual,
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
association, trust, Governmental Entity, unincorporated organization or other
entity.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with
the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates, and
from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject
to the last sentence of _Section 2.2(d)_, if, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one (1) year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand,
and any holder of Shares who has not previously complied with this _Section
2.2_ shall be entitled to receive only from the Buyer payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration, without interest. Any amount remaining unclaimed by such
holders at such time at which amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of the Buyer free and clear of any and all claims
or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the
Buyer, the Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Shares delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.



 

8 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares and/or
Company Stock Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation, the Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and
(ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the Shares and/or Company Stock Options in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, the
Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if
required by the Buyer or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Buyer or the Paying Agent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares formerly represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement.

(h) _Expenses_. The Buyer or the Acquisition Sub shall bear and pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred in
connection with the payment for Shares.

2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

(a) _Cash-Out of Vested Company Stock Options at Spread_. Immediately after
the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (" _Company Stock Options_ ") that is vested in
accordance with its terms at the Effective Time (each a " _Vested Company
Stock Option_ ") shall, to the extent so vested, without any action on the
part of the Company or the holder of such option, automatically be cancelled
and exchanged for a cash payment by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub (which
shall be made promptly after the Effective Time) in an amount equal to (i) the
excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common
Stock over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Vested Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock for which such Vested Company Stock Option is vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) _Assumption of Unvested Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding Company Stock Option that is unvested in accordance with its
terms at the Effective Time (each an " _Unvested Company Stock Option_ ")
shall, without any action on the part of the Company or any holder of such
options, automatically be assumed by the Buyer together with all stock option
plans or other equity-related plans of the Company (the " _Company Stock
Plans_ ") insofar as they relate to outstanding Unvested Company Stock
Options, and each option so assumed shall, without any action on the part of
the Company or the holder of such  



 

9  option, to the extent so unvested, automatically become an option to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
Unvested Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
number of shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Buyer ("
_Buyer Common Stock_ ") determined as follows:

(i) the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to each Company Stock
Option assumed by the Buyer shall be determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Unvested Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio
(as defined below), and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest
whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock; and

(ii) the per share exercise price for the Buyer Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of each Unvested Company Stock Option assumed by the Buyer shall be
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock
subject to such Unvested Company Stock Option, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.

The " _Conversion Ratio_ " means the quotient of Merger Consideration
per Share, divided by the average of the closing sale prices of a share of
Buyer Common Stock as reported on The Nasdaq National Market for each of the
twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Buyer Common
Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any
stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, then the Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted to the extent
appropriate to reflect such occurrence. Any restriction on the exercise of
any Unvested Company Stock Option assumed by the Buyer shall continue in full
force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other
provisions of such Unvested Company Stock Option shall otherwise remain
unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Unvested Company Stock Option,
in each case except to the extent otherwise provided in any Company Stock Plan
or any stock option or other agreement between the holder of an
Unvested Company Stock Option and the Company. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit the Buyer from adjusting the conversion described in
this subsection (b) by modifying the exercise price per share of Buyer Common
Stock, and taking such actions, in each case, as may be necessary or
appropriate to comply with Section 409A of the Code and to preserve the
intended tax treatment of the Unvested Company Stock Options.

(c) _Notification_. Within five (5) Business Days following the Effective
Time, the Buyer shall deliver to the participants in the Company Stock Plans
an appropriate notice setting forth such participants rights pursuant to the
Company Stock Options, as provided in this _Section 2.3_.

(d) _Action by Buyer_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective time, the Buyer shall
take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance under the Company
Stock Plans a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of the Unvested Company Stock  



 

10  Options assumed in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event not
later than twenty (20) days after the Buyer becomes eligible to register
securities on Form S-8 (or any successor form)), the Buyer shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another
appropriate form with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to
such options and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.

(e) _Action by the Company_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company
Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as
are required to adjust the terms of the Company Stock Options to permit the
foregoing and to provide that with respect to the Company ESPP (i)
participants thereunder may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase
elections from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii) no
purchase period will be commenced after the date of this Agreement, and (iii)
the amount of each participants accumulated contributions under the Company
ESPP as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be refunded to such
participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without
interest).

(f)  _Withholding Taxes, Consents Required_. All amounts payable pursuant to
this _Section 2.3_ shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and
shall be paid without interest.

(g) _Termination of Company ESPP_. The Company shall terminate its Amended and
Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _Company ESPP_ "),
in accordance with its terms as of or prior to the Effective Time.

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are held by a holder who did not vote in favor of the
Merger and who is entitled to demand and has made a proper demand for
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the DGCL
(any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time
as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal
rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into
or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.1_, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.1_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the Certificate formerly representing such shares.



 

11 (c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such
demand; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company
shall not waive any failure by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock to
timely comply with the requirements of the DGCL to perfect or demand
appraisal rights pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ or make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its written consent to
such payment or settlement offer.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to the Buyer and Acquisition Sub that the
statements contained in this _Article III_ are true and correct, except as
set forth herein or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to the

the industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries participate;

(b) factors generally affecting the industries or markets in which either the

directly or indirectly affects the business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, to the extent that such outbreak or escalation does not have a

industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries participate.

under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Each Subsidiary of
the Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation (to the extent such concepts are applicable) in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, operated or leased
or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for
such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing, individually
or in the aggregate, as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock and
other equity securities or interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights and all such shares (other than directors qualifying
shares in the case of non-U.S. Subsidiaries, all of which the Company has the
power to cause to be transferred for no or nominal consideration to the
Company or the Companys designee) are owned, of record and beneficially, by
the Company or another of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in the Companys
voting rights, charges or other encumbrances. There are no outstanding or
authorized options, warrants, rights, agreements or commitments to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or which are binding on any of
them providing for the issuance, disposition or acquisition of any capital
stock of any Subsidiary of the Company. There are no outstanding stock
appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights with respect to any Subsidiary
of the Company. There are no voting trusts, proxies or other agreements

association or entity which is not a Subsidiary of the Company, other than
securities in a publicly traded company held for investment by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of less than five percent (5%) of the
outstanding capital of such company, to the extent disclosed in _Section
3.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_.

3.4 _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company
Voting Proposal_ ") by the Companys stockholders under the DGCL (the "
_Company Stockholder Approval_ "), to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, (i) unanimously determined

stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and declared its advisability in

representations and warranties of Buyer and Acquisition Sub in _Section
4.7_, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,

applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and

of, any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company
or of the charter, bylaws, or other organizational document of any Subsidiary
of the Company, (ii) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of any material benefit) under, require a consent or waiver
under, require the payment of a penalty under or result in the imposition of
any mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance ("
_Liens_ ") on the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries assets under, any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any lease, license, contract or other
agreement, instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound, or (iii) subject to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval and compliance with the requirements specified in clauses (i)

Law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective properties or assets, except in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this _Section 3.4(b)_ for any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations, losses, penalties or Liens, and for any consents or waivers not
obtained, that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(c) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any court, arbitrational
tribunal, administrative agency or commission or other governmental or
regulatory authority, agency or instrumentality (a " _Governmental Entity_ ")
or any stock market or stock exchange on which shares of Company Common Stock
are listed for trading is required by or with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the

Acquisition Sub in _Section 4.5_, the affirmative vote for adoption of the
Company Voting Proposal by the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on the record date for the meeting

only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock
or other securities necessary for the adoption of this Agreement and for the
consummation by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the

securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of
the Company may vote.

(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether known or
unknown) whether or not required, if known, to be reflected or reserved
against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance
with GAAP or the notes thereto, that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the date of the Company
Balance Sheet, there has not been a Company Material Adverse Effect and have
not been any events, changes, occurrences, or state of facts that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have

until the date of this Agreement, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in the Ordinary Course of Business

3.8 _Taxes_.

(a) Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed with the
appropriate taxing authority all Tax Returns that it was required to file, and
all such Tax Returns were correct and complete, except for any failure to file
or errors or omissions that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has paid on a timely basis all Taxes that
are shown to be due on any such Tax Returns and all Taxes due and payable by
it, and has timely withheld and paid all material amounts of Taxes required to
have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any

assessments or additions to tax resulting from, attributable to or incurred in
connection with any tax or any contest or dispute thereof, and (ii) " _Tax
Returns_ " means all reports, returns, declarations, statements or other

of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2004. The federal and material state,
local and foreign income Tax Returns of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_
") or other applicable taxing authority or are closed by the applicable
statute of limitations for all taxable years through the taxable year
specified in _Section 3.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_. No
examination or audit of any Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity is currently in progress or, to the
Companys Knowledge, has been threatened and which would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations with respect to
Taxes or agreed to an extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency, other than extensions which are no longer in effect.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries: (i) has made any

Section 355 of the Code; (v) is party to any "listed transaction" as defined
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2), or a transaction that is
substantially similar to a "listed transaction"; (vi) has executed any
closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code, or any corresponding
or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law, that relates
to the assets or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
will be applicable to periods following the Closing; or (vii) will be required
to include any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of
deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof)

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach or material default
of the terms of any Policy, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries have taken any action or failed to take any action which, with
notice or lapse of time, would constitute a material breach or material
default, or permit termination or modification, of any of the Policies. No
notice of cancellation or termination has been received by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to any of the Policies. The consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, in and of itself,
cause the revocation, cancellation or termination of any Policy.

Stock to which they are attached or to be triggered or become exercisable or
cease to be redeemable.

receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (x) in response to an
unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach
of this _Section 6.1_ and that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) is, or
would be reasonably likely to constitute, a Superior Proposal, and (y) if the
Company Board otherwise determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that failure to do so would reasonably be likely to result
in a breach by the Companys directors of their fiduciary duties to the
Company or its stockholders, and subject in each case to compliance with
_Section 6.1(c)_, the Company may, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval), after providing Buyer with not less than 48 hours
written notice of its intention to take such actions (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company to any Person (and the Representatives of such
Person) making an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry ( _provided_ , that such

or contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written
materials received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal,
offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter promptly keep the Buyer fully
informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any
such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and to the extent not

entered into in the circumstances referred to in _Section 6.1(a)_ and except
as otherwise permitted by this _Section 6.1_); and (iii) adopt, approve or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clauses (i)
or (iii) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement (but
subject to the next sentence), the Company or the Company Board may take
any action otherwise prohibited by this _Section 6.1(c)_ if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law or that failure to take such action could violate their
fiduciary duties to the Company or its stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in response to a
Superior Proposal until the third Business Day following the Companys
delivery to Buyer of written notice (unless at the time such notice is
otherwise required to be given there are less than three Business Days prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in which case the Company shall provide
as much notice as is reasonably practicable) from the Company (a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Notice_ ") advising the Buyer that the Company Board

such lesser period as is reasonably practicable if less than three Business
Days remain before the Company Stockholders Meeting) before taking that
action, of its intention to make an Adverse

agreement or a detailed summary of all material terms of any such proposal
and the identity of the offeror (to the extent not prohibited by any
confidentiality agreement executed by the Company prior to the date hereof),
and (y) the Buyer does not propose, within three Business Days (or such lesser
period as specified above) after delivery by the Company of that written
notification, such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
as would enable the Company Board to proceed with its recommendation to its
stockholders without an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.1_
or in  _Section 6.5_ (or elsewhere in this Agreement) shall prohibit the

respect to any tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable
Law or would create a material risk of a breach by the Companys directors of
their fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders or (iii) furnishing
a copy of or excerpts from this Agreement to any third party (or its
representatives) that makes an Acquisition Proposal or that makes an inquiry
that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal.

be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. Promptly following the

Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Buyer (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties, assets and personnel as the Buyer may reasonably request. The
Buyer will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company shall not be required to permit any inspection or other access, or to
disclose any information or documents, that in the good faith judgment of the
Company would: (i) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties; (ii) violate any obligation of the Company with respect to
confidentiality (including any documents and information described in the
Company Disclosure Schedule whose disclosure is prohibited by the terms of a
confidentiality agreement with a third party in effect on the date of this
Agreement); (iii) jeopardize protections afforded the Company under the
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine; or (iv)
violate any legal requirement. All information obtained by the Buyer and its
representatives pursuant to this  



 

41   _Section 6.4_ shall be treated as "Evaluation Material" for purposes of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.5 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, including _Section 6.1_ and _Section
6.5(b)_, the Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall each use its
best efforts to:

(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable;

(ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity or any
other third party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by the Company, the
Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including the Acquisition Sub)
in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and
the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable
federal or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and any related governmental
request thereunder, and any other applicable Antitrust Law, and (C) any
other applicable Law; and

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall cooperate with each other
in connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies
of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing
and, if requested, accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith. The Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition
Sub shall use their respective best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to the rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall, as promptly as
practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file with
the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United
States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form
for the transactions contemplated hereby, and any supplemental information
requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act, and all other
filings under any applicable antitrust, competition, merger clearance or
similar Laws (collectively " _Antitrust Laws_ ") as may be required, in
addition to any voluntary filing in the United Kingdom (the " _UK Filing_ ").
None of the parties hereto will make any non-mandatory foreign antitrust
filing other than the UK Filing which the parties hereby agree to make as
promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto,
which consent will, in all instances, not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
 



 

42  or conditioned. The Buyer shall pay the filing fees associated with all
filings under Antitrust Laws made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Any such notification and report form and
supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of, and shall request early termination of the waiting period (if
applicable) under, the Antitrust Laws. The Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the
Company shall furnish, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to furnish,
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may request in connection with its preparation of any filing, presentation or
submission that is necessary under any applicable Antitrust Law. Each party
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to (i) promptly notify the other party
of (and, at the other partys reasonable request, supply to such other
partys counsel) any communication (or other correspondence or memoranda) to
that party or its counsel from any Governmental Entity and, subject to
applicable Law, permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any of the foregoing; (ii) not participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity unless it
consults with the other party in advance, and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting; (iii) furnish the other partys counsel with
copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between the party and the Governmental
Entity, except that any materials concerning valuation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or internal financial information may be
redacted; (iv) furnish to the other party such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary with any
Governmental Entity; and (v) permit the other partys counsel to review in
advance and, consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with any proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity.

(c) The Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall propose, negotiate, offer to
commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of the Buyer or, effective as of and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective
Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action
which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to
take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), which would have
the effect of preventing or delaying the Effective Time beyond the Outside
Date; _provided_ , that the Buyer shall not be obligated to take any of the
foregoing actions if doing so would reasonably be likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company, the Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries,
taking the Company, the Buyer and such Subsidiaries together as a whole. For
the avoidance of doubt, subject to the final proviso in the preceding
sentence, each of the Company and the Buyer shall take any and all actions
necessary in order to ensure that (i) no requirement for a waiver, consent or
approval of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, any State Attorney General or other Governmental
Entity, (ii) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or
any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (iii) no other matter relating
to any antitrust or competition Law or regulation would preclude consummation
of the Merger by the Outside Date, provided that in the case of clauses (i)
through (iii) above, the parties shall not  



 

43  be required to take any such action if it has received the advice of outside
counsel that such action does not have a reasonable probability of success. 

(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the Company, the
Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party consents, the absence of which would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect or to prevent the consummation of the Merger.

6.6 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by Law or stock market
regulations, (a) the initial press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be jointly issued and shall be in such form as shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Buyer and (b) the Buyer and the
Acquisition Sub and (except in furtherance of actions permitted by _Section
6.1_ or as required by Law) the Company shall each use its commercially
reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any other
press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the
Merger or this Agreement.

6.7 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, legislative or investigative (whether internal or
external), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party
is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
full extent required or permitted by the Companys or such Subsidiarys
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other agreements currently in effect.
Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in
the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from
each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation from the
Indemnified Party of a request therefor, provided that any such Indemnified
Party shall have provided an undertaking, to the extent required by the DGCL,
to repay such advancement if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Buyer will (and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to: (i)
each indemnification agreement in effect between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party; and (ii) any indemnification provision
and any exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or other charter or organizational documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement. From the
Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation  



 

44  and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Buyer shall cause
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, and such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified in any manner
that could adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Person benefited by
such provisions. If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Buyer, as applicable, a written notice asserting a claim
for indemnification under this section, then the claim asserted in such
notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such
time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
maintain, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Company (the " _Current D andO
Insurance_") with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
so long as the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the Effective
Time (such 250%, the " _Maximum Premium_ "), or (ii) purchase a six (6) year
extended reporting period endorsement with respect to the Current DandO
Insurance (a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain such endorsement
in full force and effect for its full term. If the Companys existing
insurance expires, is terminated or cancelled during such six-year period or
exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Buyer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and
officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such
period for an annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may,
prior to the Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided
that the Company does not pay more than six (6) times the last annual premium
for Current DandO Insurance for such Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which case,
_provided_ that the Buyer causes the Surviving Corporation to maintain such
Reporting Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its full term, the
Buyer shall be relieved from its obligations under the preceding two sentences
of this _Section 6.7(c)_.

(d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by the Persons referred to in this  _Section 6.7_ in
connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this _Section
6.7_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are intended to be in addition to
the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the
Company by law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives.

(f) The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each
officer or director of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to enter into
an agreement or  



 

45  amendment to an existing agreement providing for reasonable cooperation by
such Person in connection with any present and future actual or
threatened litigation, administrative proceeding or investigation involving
the Company or its Subsidiaries that relates to events, occurrences or conduct
occurring or claimed to have occurred during the period of such Persons
association with the Company in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer.

6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Interim Period, the
Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, and
the Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub, of
(a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or
failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty
of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, (b) any material failure of the Buyer and
Acquisition Sub or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer,
director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, (c) receipt of any notice from any third party or Governmental
Entity alleging that the consent of such third party or Governmental Entity is
or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (d) any material claims, actions, proceedings or governmental
investigations commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened, related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above,
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ will not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the
Merger. 



   6.9 | _Exemption from Liability under Section 16(b)_. 
---|--- 

(a) The Board of Directors of the Buyer, or a committee thereof consisting of
non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective
Time providing that the receipt by the Company Insiders of options to
purchase Buyer Common Stock upon assumption and conversion of Company Stock
Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby and to
the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16 Information, is
intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Section 16 Information_ " means
information regarding the Company Insiders and the number of shares of Company
Common Stock or other Company equity securities deemed to be beneficially
owned by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for options
to purchase Buyer Common Stock in connection with the Merger, which shall be
provided by the Company to the Buyer at least 10 Business Days prior to the
Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Insiders_ " means those
officers and directors of the Company who immediately after the Closing become
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to equity securities of the Buyer.

6.10 _Employee Benefits and Service Credit_. From and after the Effective
Time, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, provide employees of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Continuing Employees_ "), until the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
health and welfare  



 

46  benefits that are reasonably comparable, in the aggregate, to, at the
election of the Buyer, either those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time or those provided to
similarly situated employees of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries from time to
time under the Buyer Employee Plans (as defined below). Following the
Effective Time, the Buyer will give Continuing Employees full credit for
prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of (w)
eligibility and vesting under any Buyer Employee Plans, and (x) determination
of benefit levels under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy relating to
vacation or severance, in each case for which the Continuing Employees are
otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employees are offered
participation, but except where such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, the Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, any
limitations on medical benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the
same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of the Buyer
and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits
under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid
by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Buyer Employee Plan_ "
means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA), any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA), and any other written or oral plan, agreement or arrangement,
including insurance coverage, severance benefits, disability benefits,
deferred compensation, bonuses, stock options, stock purchase, phantom stock,
stock appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-
retirement compensation and all unexpired severance agreements, for the
benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee of the Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries or any entity which is a member of (A) a controlled group
of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code), (B) a group of
trades or businesses under common control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the
Code) or (C) an affiliated service group (as defined in Section 414(m) of the
Code or the regulations under Section 414(o) of the Code), any of which
includes or included the Buyer or a Subsidiary of the Buyer.

6.11 _Financing_.

(a) The Buyer and the Acquisition Sub will use their best efforts to obtain
the proceeds of the Financing, including using their best efforts to (A)
consummate the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters at such time
as all conditions set forth in  _Section 7.1_ are satisfied (except for
those requiring delivery of a certificate evidencing certain matters), (B)
maintain the effectiveness of the Commitment Letters (and the term sheets and
fee letters related thereto) in accordance with their respective terms, other
than such amendments or modifications as would not reasonably be expected to
impair the Buyer and the Acquisition Subs ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (C) enter into definitive agreements with
respect to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters consistent
with the terms and conditions contained therein, and (D) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions precedent to funding in such definitive agreements and
in the Commitment Letters (and the term sheets and fee letters related
thereto); provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer may
terminate, or allow the termination of, the Debt Commitment Letter, if prior
thereto or substantially concurrently therewith the Buyer enters into a
replacement commitment letter that contains no conditions precedent to funding
thereunder beyond (or materially and adversely modified from) those in the
Debt Commitment Letter, and provides for financing in an amount that, when
taken together with the amount of equity provided under the Equity Commitment
Letter, is not less than that  



 

47  provided for in the Financing as of the date of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, occurrence of the Financing and/or the Buyers receipt
of the proceeds thereof shall not be a condition precedent to the obligations
of the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub to effect the Merger.

(b) The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist and
cooperate with the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub in connection with their
efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Financing, including but not limited to
using commercially reasonable efforts to provide information relating to the
Company reasonably requested by the financial institution or institutions
providing the Financing, using commercially reasonable efforts to make
representatives of and advisors to the Company reasonably available in
connection with syndication efforts regarding the Financing, and using
commercially reasonable efforts to execute and deliver, and cause the
Companys Subsidiaries and its and their officers, to execute and deliver,
customary certificates and other documents and instruments relating to
guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other matters ancillary to the Debt
Financing as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer in connection with the
Debt Financing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no obligation of the Company
or any of the Companys Subsidiaries under any such certificate, document or
instrument will be effective until the Effective Time and none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries will be required to pay any commitment or other
similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing
prior to the Effective Time.

6.12 _FIRPTA Tax Certificates_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to the Buyer and to the IRS notices that the shares of Company Common
Stock are not "U.S. real property interests" in accordance with
Treasury Regulations under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code, together with
authorization for the Buyer to deliver such notices or certifications to the
IRS upon the Closing. If the Buyer does not receive the notices described
above on or before the Closing Date in form and substance sufficient to
assure the Buyer that it has satisfied its obligations under Treasury
Regulation 1.1445-2(c)(3), along with such authorization, the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be permitted to withhold from
the payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement any required withholding
tax under Section 1445 of the Code.

6.13  _Securities Exchange Act Compliance_. The Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to file all annual and quarterly reports on
Forms 10-K and 10-Q and all other reports and filings required by the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be filed by it from the date hereof
through the Closing Date on a timely basis and to obtain all auditor action
and consents required for the timely filing thereof.

6.14 _Available Cash_. Immediately prior to and at the Effective Time, the
Company will have available in the United States excess cash on hand in U.S.
dollars in an aggregate amount of not less than $75.0 million.

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time (with respect to _Sections 8.1(b)_ through _8.1(g)_ , by
written notice by the terminating party to the other party), whether before
or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Company at any time prior
to the Effective Time; or

(b) by either the Buyer or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred by the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Outside Date_ ") ( _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose
failure (or whose Subsidiarys failure) to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Effective Time to occur on or before the Outside Date, and _provided_  
_further_ , that the passage of such period shall be tolled for up to three
months during which any party shall be subject to a non-final order, decree,
ruling or action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger); or



 

51 (c) by either the Buyer or the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time
if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a
nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any other nonappealable
final action, in each case having the effect of permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger; 

(d) by either the Company or the Buyer, if the Company Stockholder Approval
shall not have been obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting duly
convened therefor or at any adjournment or postponement thereof; _provided_ ,
_howeve_ r, that the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.1(d_) shall not be available to it if it has failed to
comply in any material respect with its obligations under _Sections 6.1_ and
_6.2_ ;

(e) by the Buyer if (A) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have
occurred or (B) the Company Board or any committee thereof (x) shall not have
rejected any Acquisition Proposal (including, for these purposes, by taking no
position with respect to the acceptance by the Companys stockholders of a
tender offer or exchange offer, which shall constitute a failure to reject
such Acquisition Proposal) within three Business Days after receipt of a
written request from Buyer that it do so if such request is made following
the making by any Person of an Acquisition Proposal or (y) shall have failed
to publicly reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation within three Business
Days after receipt of a written request from Buyer that it do so if such
request is made following the public disclosure by any Person of an
Acquisition Proposal;

(f) by the Buyer at any time prior to the Effective Time, if there has been a
breach of or failure to perform any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, which breach
or failure to perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in _Sections
7.1(d)_ or _7.1(e)_ not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured
within twenty (20) Business Days following receipt by the Company of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform from the Buyer; or

(g) by the Company, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Buyer or
the Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to
perform (i) would cause the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(d)_ or
_7.2(e)_ not to be satisfied, and (ii) shall not have been cured within
twenty (20) Business Days following receipt by the Buyer of written notice of
such breach or failure to perform from the Company.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof will be given to the other
parties to this Agreement, and this Agreement shall immediately become void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company, the
Buyer, the Acquisition Sub or their respective officers,
directors, stockholders or Affiliates; _provided_ , that (a) any such
termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful breach
of this Agreement (including, in the case of the Buyer and the Acquisition
Sub, damages based on the consideration payable to the stockholders of the
Company as contemplated by this Agreement) or from liability for fraud and (b)
the provisions of _Sections 5.2_ (Confidentiality) and _8.3_ (Fees and
Expenses), this  _Section 8.2_ (Effect of Termination) and _Article IX_
(Miscellaneous) of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

52 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not
the Merger is consummated.

(b) In the event that:

(i)(A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the Company or
shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally or any Person
shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional or
withdrawn) to make an Acquisition Proposal, and thereafter (B) this Agreement
is terminated by the Company or Buyer pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)_ or
_8.1(d)_ and, in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, such
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or announced, and (C)
the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal within
twelve (12) months after the date this Agreement is terminated;

(ii)(A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to the Company or
shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally or any
Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional
or withdrawn) to make an Acquisition Proposal, and thereafter (B) this
Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ and the
Companys breach or failure triggering such termination shall have been
willful, and (C) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect
to, or consummates, a transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal
within twelve (12) months after the date this Agreement is terminated; or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_;
then in any such event under clause (i) or (ii), or this clause (iii) of this
_Section 8.3(b)_, the Company shall pay to Buyer a termination fee of $35.5
million in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ").

(c) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) or (iii) of
_Section 8.3(b)_ shall be made to Buyer promptly upon the earlier of the
execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of,
any transaction contemplated by a Acquisition Proposal. All such payments
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
to be designated by the Buyer.

(d) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee
required pursuant to this  _Section 8.3_ when due, such fee shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a
rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City
of New York from time to time during such period, as such banks Prime
Lending Rate plus 2%. In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay such fee
when due, the Company shall also pay to the other party all of the other
partys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with
efforts to collect such fee. The Company acknowledges that the fee and the
other provisions of this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into
this Agreement.



 

53 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of any party, but, after any such approval, no
amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, except as
otherwise provided, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized
by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed,
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not
apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may
be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, telex, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or
other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until
it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to

communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to
this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth.

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and the parties
hereto specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior understandings,
agreements or representations to the extent not embodied in this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (a) the Buyer and the
Acquisition Sub acknowledge that the Company has not made and is not making
any  



 

55  representation or warranty whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement, express or implied, except as set forth in _Article III_ , and
that neither the Buyer nor the Acquisition Sub is relying or has relied on
any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of
this Agreement, express or implied, except those set forth in _Article III_ ;
and (b) the Company acknowledges that the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub have
not made and are not making any representations or warranties whatsoever
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except set
forth in _Article IV_ , and that it is not relying and has not relied on any
representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement, express or implied, except as set forth in _Article IV_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms.

9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 6.7_
(with respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party
beneficiaries) this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to
confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any
agreement of employment with any Person or to otherwise create any third-party
beneficiary hereto.

9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

9.6 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision
that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise  



 

56  indicated. The table of contents, table of defined terms and headings
contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The
language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by
the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever the context may
require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding
masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and
pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware. 

9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity.

9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or of any federal court sitting in
Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard
and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make
service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to
the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section 9.2_. Nothing in this _Section 9.11_, however,
shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by Law.



 

57 9.12 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall each be
arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in this
Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall qualify (a) the
corresponding section of this Agreement and (b) the other sections of this
Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of
such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections. The
inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has
resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or is outside
the Ordinary Course of Business.

9.13 _Company s Knowledge_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Knowledge_ " and similar terms when used with respect to the Company mean
the actual knowledge after reasonable inquiry of the individuals identified in
_Section 9.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_.

9.14 _Obligation of the Buyer_. The Buyer shall ensure that each of the
Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation duly performs, satisfies and
discharges on a timely basis each of the covenants, obligations and
liabilities of the Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation under this
Agreement, and the Buyer shall be jointly and severally liable with the
Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation for the due and timely
performance and satisfaction of each of said covenants, obligations and
liabilities.

9.15 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY INVOLVING ANY MATTERS (WHETHER
SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO
OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

9.16 _No Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that
it shall not be entitled to punitive damages as a remedy in any action brought
in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
thereby.

9.17 _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and will not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement will be enforced and construed
as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.
