only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall
be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver, and shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause their agents to deliver, to the Company or destroy all copies
and any extracts or summaries from such information then in their possession
or control.

(subject to the Companys receipt of the information with respect to Parent
and its nominees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder). The provisions of this Section
2.03 are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that Acquisition Sub,
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent may have (with respect to the election of
directors or otherwise) under Applicable Law as a holder or beneficial owner
of Shares.

consummation of the Offer on a date and at a time to be specified by Parent,

(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), or at such other
date, time or location as Parent and the Company may otherwise agree in

that, to the extent Parent and the Company so agree, documents may be
delivered and exchanged at the Closing by facsimile, PDF, or other electronic
means. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

 **Section 3.02** ** ****The Merger**.

 



 

(a) Contemporaneously with, or as promptly as practicable after the Closing,
the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of
State_ ") a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") satisfying
the applicable requirements of, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL in order to consummate the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by
Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ "). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue its
existence as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent under the laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company, in its capacity as the corporation surviving the
Merger, is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the " _Surviving
Corporation_."

 



 

(b) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 8.03, at the Effective Time, (i) the certificate of
incorporation of Acquisition Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation,
except that the name of the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to
the name of the Company, and (ii) the bylaws of Acquisition Sub in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, except that the name of the corporation set forth therein shall
be changed to the name of the Company, in each case, until thereafter amended
in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such certificate of
incorporation or bylaws.

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
and, unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **Section 3.03** ** ****Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders**

 



 

The Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL. The parties agree
to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer,
without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section
251(h) of the DGCL.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV. 
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES**

 



 

 **Section 4.01** ** ****Effect of Merger on Capital Stock**.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or their respective
stockholders, (i) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting
Shares) shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Offer Price (such amount of cash hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof, without interest, in
accordance with Section 4.02, (ii) all Shares that are owned directly by
Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or held in
treasury of the Company or by any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (in each
case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties) (the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and retired without any conversion
thereof and shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made in respect
thereof and (iii) each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and without
duplication of any adjustment made pursuant to Section 2.01(f), if at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall
occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or stock dividend
thereon.

 



 

 **Section 4.02** ** ****Exchange Procedures; Surrender and Payment**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, all of the Shares converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this ARTICLE IV shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and
each holder of a non-certificated Share represented by book entry (each, a "
_Book-Entry Share_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
previously representing any such Shares shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by Applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this ARTICLE IV.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust
company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as Paying Agent in
the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of (i) the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented by a Certificate and each Book-Entry Share
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, in each case, other than
the Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares and (ii) the
aggregate Cashed Out Compensatory Award Consideration payable by the Paying
Agent pursuant to Section 4.05. Substantially concurrent with the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash
in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and Cashed
Out Compensatory Award Consideration required to be paid by the Paying Agent
in accordance with this Agreement (such cash shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments in connection with the Merger Consideration
contemplated by Section 4.01 or the aggregate Cashed Out Compensatory Award
Consideration contemplated by Section 4.05 and payable by the Paying Agent,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with
the Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payments. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
issued pursuant to Section 4.01 and the Cashed Out Compensatory Award
Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 4.05 and payable
by the Paying Agent out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

 



 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third Business Day following the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of Shares
(other than the Cancelled Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares)
represented by Certificate(s) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) in such
form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, for use in effecting
delivery of Shares to the Paying Agent, and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares
shall be required to deliver a Certificate or a letter of transmittal to the
Paying Agent in order to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.01 in respect of such Book-Entry
Shares.

 



 

(d) Upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or an affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof), together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions or (ii) compliance with the reasonable procedures established by
the Paying Agent for delivery of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive promptly in
exchange therefor, in cash, the Merger Consideration in respect of each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE
IV.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer Taxes required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Shares or holders of Cashed Out Compensatory Awards after the date which is
one year following the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent upon demand.
Any holder of Shares who has not exchanged such holders Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 4.02 and any holder of Cashed
Out Compensatory Awards who has not received the Cashed Out Compensatory Award
Consideration in accordance with Section 4.05 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration or
Cashed Out Compensatory Award Consideration in respect of such holders Shares
or Cashed Out Compensatory Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
of Shares or Cashed Out Compensatory Awards for any Merger Consideration or
Cashed Out Compensatory Award Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Section 4.02 to pay for shares for which appraisal rights
shall have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 



 

(h) All Merger Consideration or Cashed Out Compensatory Award Consideration
issued and paid upon conversion of the Shares or the Cashed Out Compensatory
Awards, respectively, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall be
deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares or Cashed Out Compensatory Awards, as the case may
be.

 



 

 **Section 4.03** ** ****Lost Certificates**. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid
in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate as contemplated by
this ARTICLE IV.

 



 

 **Section 4.04** ** ****Withholding Rights**. Each of Parent, Acquisition
Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
pursuant to the Code or under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as

 



      
 

 



 

the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

 **Section 4.05** ** ****Treatment of Company Compensatory Awards**.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each Company Option that is outstanding and
vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Cashed Out Company
Options_ ") shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, rounding such amount
down to the nearest whole cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the aggregate number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration less the exercise price per share of such Company Option (the "
_Option Consideration_ "). Each Company Option that is outstanding and vested
and that has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that equals
or exceeds the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist without entitling the holder thereof to receive any payment under this
Section 4.05(a).

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and is
unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by
Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option
denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock having the same terms and
conditions as the Company Option (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "), except that
(i) each such Assumed Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable
in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares underlying such Company
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) a
fraction (such ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the
Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the volume weighted
average price for a share of Parent Common Stock for the five trading days
immediately prior to (and excluding) the Closing Date as reported by
Bloomberg, L.P. (the " _Parent Closing Price_ "), and rounding such product
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (the amount
of such rounding, the " _Fractional Cancelled Option_ ") and (ii) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient determined by
dividing (A) the exercise price per Share of such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and
rounding such quotient up to the nearest whole cent (such exercise price, the
" _Assumed Option Exercise Price_ ") and (iii) the Fractional Cancelled Option
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, rounding such
amount down to the nearest whole cent, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to such Fractional Cancelled Option immediately after the Effective Time and
(B) the excess, if any, of the Parent Closing Price less the Assumed Option
Exercise Price (the " _Fractional Cancelled Option Consideration_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Assumed Option Exercise Price and the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Options shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code and the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of

 



      
 

 



 

the Code applies, the Assumed Option Exercise Price and the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined
in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary
in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Parent will deliver to
each Person who holds an Assumed Option a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of the Company Option by Parent.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each award of Company RSUs that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and
converted automatically at the Effective Time into a restricted stock unit
award denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock having the same terms and
conditions as the award of Company RSUs (each, an " _Assumed RSU Award_ "),
except that (i) each such award of Company RSUs will entitle the holder, upon
settlement, to that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of (A) the number of Shares that were issuable with regard to such
award of Company RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by
(B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding such product down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (the amount of such rounding, the "
_Fractional Cancelled RSU_ ") and (ii) the Fractional Cancelled RSU shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, rounding such amount
down to the nearest whole cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that were issuable with regard
to such Fractional Cancelled RSU immediately after the Effective Time,
multiplied by (B) the Parent Closing Price (the " _Fractional Cancelled RSU
Consideration_ "). As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent will deliver to each Person who holds an Assumed RSU Award a
document evidencing the foregoing assumption of the award of Company RSUs by
Parent.

 



 

(d) Any current or former employee of the Company entitled to Option
Consideration, Fractional Cancelled Option Consideration or Fractional
Cancelled RSU Consideration (collectively, the " _Cashed Out Compensatory
Award Consideration_ ") in respect of Cashed Out Company Options, Fractional
Cancelled Options and Fractional Cancelled RSUs (collectively, the " _Cashed
Out Compensatory Awards_ ") shall be paid such Cashed Out Compensatory Award
Consideration through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or, if
not a current or former employee of the Company, through the Paying Agent, in
each case, payable as soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and, in
the case of current or former employees of the Company, in no event later than
the next regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation
following the Closing Date).

 



 

(e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company Stock Plans,
provided that (i) all references to "Company" in the applicable Company Stock
Plan and award agreements evidencing the Assumed Options, Assumed RSU Awards
and any other awards granted thereunder by Parent after the Effective Time
will be deemed references to Parent and (ii) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock available for awards under the Company Stock Plans shall be
determined by adjusting the number of Shares available for awards under the
Company Stock Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with
the Exchange Ratio.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory Award or
any participant in any Company Stock Plan, or other Company Employee Plan or
employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement,
shall have any right hereunder to acquire any capital stock or other equity
interests (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **Section 4.06** ** ****Dissenting Shares.**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to each Share as to which the holder thereof shall have (i) properly complied
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights and (ii)
not effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its rights to appraisal (each, a
" _Dissenting Share_ "), if any, such holder shall be entitled to payment,
solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the appraisal value of the
Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
holder of Dissenting Shares (x) under the circumstances permitted by and in
accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws or loses (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) the right to dissent or its right for appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares, (y) fails to establish his, her or its entitlement to
appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (z) takes or fails to take any
action the consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment
for his, her or its shares under the DGCL, then in each such case, such holder
or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such
Shares and such Shares shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares,
and each such Share shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law,
thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares and the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, (i) voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal for Dissenting Shares, (ii) offer to settle any such
demands, (iii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal in accordance with the DGCL or (iv) agree to do any of the
foregoing.

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties makes such

to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

respect.

 **Section 5.17** ** ****Employees and Employee Benefit Plans**.

 



 

(a) Section 5.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate
and complete list identifying each "employee benefit plan," as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, each material employment, severance or similar Contract
and each other plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for
compensation, bonuses, commission, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock
related rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation
benefits, insurance (including any self-insured arrangements), health or
medical benefits, employee assistance program, disability or sick leave
benefits, workers compensation,

 



      
 

 



 

supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits, change of control
payments, post-employment or retirement benefits and other time-off benefits
(including compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits)
which is maintained, administered or contributed to by any Acquired Company or
any ERISA Affiliate and covers any employee or former employee of any Acquired
Company, or with respect to which such Acquired Company has any liability.
Such plans are referred to collectively herein as the " _Employee Plans_." The
Company has separately identified in Section 5.17(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule each Employee Plan which is maintained for the benefit of any
employee or service provider (or former employee or service provider) who
performs services for the Acquired Companies outside the United States (the "
_Foreign Plans_ ").

 



 

(b) The Company has furnished or made available to Parent (i) accurate and
complete copies of all documents constituting each Employee Plan (or a written
summary thereof) to the extent currently effective, including all amendments
thereto and all related trust documents; (ii) the most recent annual report
(Form 5500 and all schedules and financial statements attached thereto), if
any, required under ERISA or the Code in connection with each Employee Plan;
(iii) if the Employee Plan is funded, the most recent annual and periodic
accounting of Employee Plan assets; (iv) the most recent summary plan
description together with the summary(ies) of material modifications thereto,
if any, required under ERISA with respect to each Employee Plan; and (v)
accurate and complete copies of the most recent IRS determination (or opinion)
letter if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Employee Plan that is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code.

 



 

(c) No Employee Plan is, and neither the Acquired Companies nor any ERISA
Affiliate thereof sponsors, maintains, contributes to, or has ever sponsored,
maintained, contributed to, or has any actual or contingent liability with
respect to any (i) single employer plan or other pension plan that is subject
to Title IV of ERISA or the funding requirements of Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code; (ii) "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of
Section 413(c) of the Code; (iii) any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of ERISA); or (iv) multiple employer welfare arrangement
(within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA).

 



 

(d) None of the Acquired Companies, any Employee Plan nor, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any trustee, administrator or other third-party fiduciary and/or
party-in-interest thereof, has engaged in any breach of fiduciary
responsibility or any "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) to which Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code applies and which could subject the Acquired
Companies or any ERISA Affiliate to a material tax or penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code. None of the Acquired
Companies have engaged in a transaction that would reasonably be expected to
result in a material civil penalty under Sections 409 or 502(i) of ERISA. None
of the Acquired Companies nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any material
liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I
of ERISA with respect to any Employee Plan.

 



 

(e) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Acquired
Company (i) has performed all obligations required to be performed by such
Acquired Company

 



       
 

 



 

under each Employee Plan established or maintained for the benefit of any
employee or service provider (or former employee or service provider) who
performs services in the United States of America (the " _U.S. Employee Plans_
") and (ii) is not in default with respect to or in violation of, and has no
Knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to, any U.S. Employee
Plan. Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each U.S.
Employee Plan (x) has been established, operated and maintained in accordance
with its terms and in compliance with Applicable Law, including ERISA and the
Code and (y) that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter, if
applicable), or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an
application for such determination from the IRS, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no reason why any such determination (or opinion) letter
should be revoked or not be reissued.

 



 

(f) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (either alone or together with any other event, including a subsequent
termination of employment or service) (i) entitle any current or former
employee or independent contractor of any Acquired Company to severance pay or
a material increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after
the date of this Agreement, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of
compensation or benefits or increase the amount payable under any Employee
Plan, (iii) trigger any payment of funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under any Employee Plan or (iv) trigger
any other material obligation pursuant to any Employee Plan (including any
acceleration of vesting with respect to a Company Compensatory Award held by
employees of an Acquired Company as a result of the Offer or the Merger or any
termination of employment in connection therewith). No payment or benefit
(including vesting of Company Compensatory Awards) that will or may be made by
the Company or its ERISA Affiliates to any current or former employee or other
service provider of any Acquired Company is reasonably be expected to be
characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code. There is no Contract by which any Acquired Company is
bound to compensate any employee for excise or additional taxes imposed under
Sections 4999 or 409A of the Code.

 



 

(g) Except as set forth on the Company Balance Sheet, no Acquired Company or
ERISA Affiliate has any material current or projected liability in respect of
post-employment or post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits
for retired, former or current employees of any Acquired Company or any ERISA
Affiliate, except as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the
Code or except for the continuation of coverage through the end of the
calendar month in which termination from employment occurs.

 



 

(h) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Foreign
Plan (i) is in compliance with the provisions of the Applicable Laws of each
jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is maintained and has been
administered in all respects in accordance with its terms; and (ii) has no
material unfunded liabilities that, as of the Effective Time, will not be
offset by insurance or are fully accrued on the Company Financial Statements.

 



 

(i) Each material "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in
Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) maintained or sponsored by the Company has
been operated in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the
Code and the guidance issued thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against
any Employee Plan or any trust related thereto which could reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability to any of the Acquired Companies,
and no audit or other proceeding by a Governmental Authority is pending, or to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Employee Plan.

 



 

(k) No Acquired Company is a party to or bound by, or is currently negotiating
in connection with entering into, any collective bargaining agreement or other
labor-related contract or arrangement with a labor union, works council or
similar organization. To the Knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2012
through the date hereof, there have been no attempts by any labor union, works
council or similar organization to organize any employees of the Acquired
Companies.

 



 

(l) Each Acquired Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, or any
similar Applicable Law relating to plant closings and layoffs. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, each Acquired Company is in compliance with
all Applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair employment practices
(including equal employment opportunity laws), terms and conditions of
employment, classification of employees, workers compensation, occupational
safety and health, affirmative action, employee privacy, plant closings, and
wages and hours.

 



 

 **Section 5.18** ** ****Environmental Matters**. Except as would not have or
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect:

 



 

(a) (i) as of the date hereof, no written notice, notification, demand,
request for information, citation, summons or order has been received that
remains outstanding, no complaint has been filed that remains outstanding, no
penalty has been assessed that remains outstanding and no Proceeding is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened by any Governmental
Authority or other Person affecting any Acquired Company and, with respect to
any of the foregoing, alleging violation of, or liability relating to, any
Environmental Law; (ii) each Acquired Company is, and has at all times since
January 1, 2012 been, in material compliance with applicable Environmental
Laws and applicable Environmental Permits; (iii) to the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no liabilities or obligations of any Acquired Company under
applicable Environmental Law for release or presence of any Hazardous
Substance; and (iv) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no Orders,
indemnities or other circumstances or conditions involving any Acquired
Company that could reasonably be expected to result in any claim or liability
relating to any Environmental Law.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent applicable and material
environmental reports and results of investigations of which the Company has
Knowledge and that are in its possession pertaining to the business of any
Acquired Company or any property or facility of any Acquired Company for which
such Acquired Company has or would reasonably be expected to have ongoing
liability.

 



      
 

 



 

The representations set forth in this Section 5.18 constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of the Company relating to
environmental matters.

 



 

 **Section 5.19** ** ****Affiliate Transactions**. No director or officer of
the Company or members of their "immediate family" (as such terms are defined
in Rule 16a-1 of the Exchange Act) (each of the foregoing, a " _Related
Person_ "), other than in his or her capacity as a director, officer or
employee of any Acquired Company (a) is involved, directly or indirectly, in
any material business arrangement or other material relationship with any
Acquired Company, or (b) directly or indirectly owns, or otherwise has any
right, title, interest in, to or under, any material property or right,
tangible or intangible, that is used by any Acquired Company and is material
to the conduct of the business of the Acquired Companies as currently
conducted, taken as a whole.

 



 

 **Section 5.20** ** ****No Brokers**. Except for Qatalyst Partners LP (the "
_Company Financial Advisor_ "), an accurate and complete copy of whose
engagement agreement has been provided to Parent, there is no investment
banker, broker, finder or other financial intermediary that has been retained
by or is authorized to act on behalf of any Acquired Company who is entitled
to any fee or commission from any Acquired Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.21** ** ****Fairness Opinion**. The Company Board of Directors
has received the opinion of the Company Financial Advisor to the effect that,

facsimile to each of the individuals set forth in Schedule 7.01 to this
Agreement. Any of the individuals set forth in Schedule 7.01 to this Agreement
may grant consent on behalf of Parent to the taking of any action which would
otherwise be prohibited pursuant to Section 7.01 by e-mail or such other
notice that complies with the provisions of Section 11.01.

 



 

 **Section 7.02** ** ****No Control of Company s Business**. Nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Acquisition Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Acquired Companies prior to the Effective Time. Prior to

 



      
 

 



 

the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



 

 **Section 7.03** ** ****No Solicitation**.

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of the Acquired Companies and its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their Affiliates and Representatives) ongoing as of the
date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (or that would
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal). The Company also
agrees that it will promptly request each Person that has executed a
confidentiality agreement prior to the date hereof in connection with its
consideration of acquiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to return or
destroy all confidential information furnished to such Person prior to the
date hereof by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives.

 



 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.03, from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01, the Company shall not, and shall
not authorize or permit any Acquired Company or any of its Representatives to,
directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage any
inquiry, expression of interest or proposal by, or offer that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal (or that would reasonably be expected to result in an
Acquisition Proposal) from any Person other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or
their respective Affiliates or Representatives; (ii) engage or participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent,
Acquisition Sub or their respective Affiliates or Representatives) in
furtherance of or for the purpose of obtaining any Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
furnish any information relating to any Acquired Company to any Person (other
than Parent, Acquisition Sub or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives) in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal;
(iv) accept any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement
or understanding relating to any Acquisition Proposal with any Person other
than Parent, Acquisition Sub or their respective Affiliates or Representatives
(other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 7.03(d)); or (v)
submit any Acquisition Proposal to the vote of the stockholders of the
Company.

 



 

(c) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01, the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days after the
Companys Knowledge of such event) notify Parent orally and in writing (which
may be by email) of any expression of interest, proposal or offer with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for discussions or negotiations
regarding an Acquisition Proposal that is received from any Person (other than
Parent, Acquisition Sub or their respective Affiliates or Representatives)
after the date hereof by any Acquired Company or its Representatives and
thereafter shall (x) keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and
in any event within two Business Days), of any material development regarding
the status or terms of any such expressions of interest, proposals or offers
(including any amendments thereto) or requests and shall reasonably promptly
(and in any event within two Business Days) apprise Parent of the status of
any such discussions or negotiations

 



       
 

 



 

and (y) provide to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof (and in any event within one Business Day) copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent by or provided to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries from any Person that describes any of the terms or
conditions of any Acquisition Proposal. In connection with such notice, the
Company shall indicate the identity of such Person and shall provide a copy of
any such expression of interest, proposal or offer that was received. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing
(which may be by email) if the Company determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 7.03(d), prior to providing any such
information or engaging in any such discussions or negotiations.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.03, if at any
time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time: (i) the Company has received an
unsolicited, bona fide and written Acquisition Proposal providing for the
acquisition of more than fifty percent (50%) of the assets (on a consolidated
basis) or more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the
equity securities of the Company (by acquisition, merger or otherwise) from a
third party; (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of
this Section 7.03; (iii) the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal; and (iv) after consultation with its outside
counsel, the Company Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee
thereof determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under the DGCL, then the Company may (A) furnish information with
respect to the Acquired Companies to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the
Company (x) shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any Acquired Company
or any of its Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such
Person without first entering into a confidentiality agreement containing
limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public information furnished
to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies and
"standstill" provisions, in each case no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) shall promptly
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Acquired Companies
provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
(I) (1) the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide and written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.03 and that the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal,
after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement
that may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (2) the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board of Directors to the
stockholders of the Company under the DGCL, or (II) the Company Board of
Directors determines (other than with respect to an Acquisition Proposal) in
good faith, after consultation

 



      
 

 



 

with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board of Directors
to the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL, then the Company Board of
Directors may at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time (y) effect a
Change of Board Recommendation or (z) in the case of clause (I) above,
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless the Company complies with the provisions of
Section 10.01(e) and Section 10.03(b); and _provided_ , _further_ that the
Company Board of Directors may not withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause
(y) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) unless
(A) the Acquired Companies shall not have materially breached this Section
7.03 and (B):

 



 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the Companys
intention to take any action permitted under clause (y) or (z) above, which
notice shall, in the case of clause (I) above, specify the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided to
Parent a copy of the available relevant proposed transaction agreements with
the party making such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "); and

 



 

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal or, in the case of clause (II) above, the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to make such a Change of Board
Recommendation would not be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Company Board of Directors to the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL.
In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with
the requirements of this Section 7.03(e) with respect to such new written
notice, except that references to the three Business Day period above shall be
deemed to be references to a one Business Day period; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that such new written notice shall in no event shorten the
original Notice Period.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Section 7.03 shall prohibit the Company, or the Company
Board of Directors, directly or indirectly through any Representative, from
disclosing in the Schedule 14D-9 or otherwise factual information regarding
the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Acquired
Companies or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made,

 



      
 

 



 

the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal or the material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company has in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, determined that such
information, facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed under
Applicable Law or that failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors under Applicable
Law and, _provided_ , _further_ , that if such disclosure does not reaffirm
the Company Board Recommendation or has the substantive effect of withdrawing
or adversely modifying the Company Board Recommendation, such disclosure shall
be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation and Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 10.01(f). So long as
the Company and its Representatives have otherwise complied with this Section
7.03, none of the foregoing shall prohibit the Company and its
Representatives, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, from
contacting any Persons or group of Persons that have made an Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification
of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Acquisition
Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal, and any such actions shall not be a breach of this Section 7.03.

 



 

 **Section 7.04** ** ****Access to Information**. Subject to Applicable Law,
from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, upon reasonable
notice and during normal business hours, the Company shall and shall cause
each other Acquired Company to (a) give Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access to the offices, properties, books, contracts and records of
the Acquired Companies, (b) furnish to Parent and its Representatives such
financial and operating data and other information relating to the Acquired
Companies and their properties and businesses as such Persons may reasonably
request and (c) instruct the Representatives of the Acquired Companies to
cooperate with Parent in its investigation of the Acquired Companies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no investigation pursuant to this Section 7.04
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Acquired Companies shall
not be required to provide access to any information or documents which would,
in the reasonable judgment of the Company (i) breach any Contract with any
Person, (ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege
held by any of the Acquired Companies, (iii) otherwise violate Applicable Law
or (iv) interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of the
Acquired Companies or would otherwise result in significant interference with
the prompt and timely discharge by employees of the Acquired Companies of
their duties (it being agreed that the Company shall give notice to Parent of
the fact that it is withholding such information or documents pursuant to
clauses (i) through (iv) above, and thereafter the Company and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate to cause such information to be provided in a manner that
would not reasonably be expected to waive the applicable privilege or
protection or violate the applicable restriction). Any investigation pursuant
to this Section 7.04 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Acquired Companies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not have access to personnel
records of the Acquired Companies relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information, in each case to
the extent the disclosure thereof would result in the violation of Applicable
Law.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 7.05** ** ****Stock Exchange Delisting; Takeover Statutes**.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under Applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of all Shares from NASDAQ and the
deregistration of all Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after
the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) If any Anti-Takeover Law is or may become applicable to the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Anti-Takeover Law
on such transactions to the greatest extent permissible under such Anti-
Takeover Law.

 



 

 **Section 7.06** ** ****Payoff Letters**. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent no later than two
Business Days prior to the Closing Date a customary payoff letter with respect
to (i) the satisfaction and release of all of the Acquired Companies
liabilities and obligations (including all indebtedness for borrowed money, if
any, of the Acquired Companies outstanding as of the Closing, but excluding
any indemnification obligations that survive termination) under the Contracts
set forth on Section 7.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Loan
Documents_ "), (ii) the termination of the Loan Documents and (iii) the
release of all Liens held pursuant to or otherwise related to the Loan
Documents.

 



 

 **Section 7.07** ** ****Compensation Arrangements**. Prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors
(the " _Compensation Committee_ ") shall cause each Employee Plan pursuant to
which consideration is payable to any officer, director or employee who is a
holder of any security of the Company to be approved by the Compensation
Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

obtain the applicable clearance, approval or waiver of any Governmental
Authority charged with the enforcement of any Applicable Law with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (y) the expiration or

between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(b) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall consult with the other and issue a joint press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement. Thereafter, neither the Company
nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue any press
release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously publicly
disclosed or made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i) as such press
release or other public announcement may be required by Applicable Law or the
applicable rules of NASDAQ, in which case the party required to issue

 



      
 

 



 

the release or make the announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such release or announcement in advance of its issuance or (ii) in connection

and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the other
parties, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **Section 8.03** ** ****Indemnification of Officers and Directors**.

 



 

(a) After the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who on or prior to
the Effective Time were officers or directors of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or were serving at the request of the Company as an officer or
director of any other corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time to
the fullest extent that the Company or Subsidiary for which they were acting
in such capacity would have been permitted to indemnify and hold harmless such
individuals by Applicable Law (including with respect to advancement of
expenses).

 



 

(b) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation or
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current and former
directors and officers of any Acquired Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their predecessors in all of their capacities (including
as stockholder, controlling or otherwise) and the heirs, executors, trustees,
fiduciaries and administrators of such officer or director (each, a " _D andO
Indemnitee_"), as provided in the Companys or each of its Subsidiaries
respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational or governing documents) or in any agreement, shall survive the
Offer and the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum extent that the applicable
Acquired Company would have been permitted to fulfill and honor them by
Applicable Law. In addition, for a period of six years following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six-year
period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any respect, except as required by Applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for
the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability
coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies
and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting
or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys existing policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay an aggregate
premium for such "tail" insurance policies in excess of the amount set forth
in Section 8.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. If Parent or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current DandO
Insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing
policies, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, the
DandO Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with
comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current DandO Insurance carrier, that is no less
favorable than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300%
of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
provided further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 8.03 shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee,
and nothing in this Agreement shall affect any indemnification rights that any
such DandO Indemnitee may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of any Acquired Company or any Contract or Applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations under this Section
8.03 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any DandO Indemnitee without the consent of such DandO Indemnitee.

 



 

(e) The rights of each DandO Indemnitee under this Section 8.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of any Acquired Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its subsidiaries, or under any Applicable Law or under any agreement of
any DandO Indemnitee with any Acquired Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) In the event that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least 50% of its properties and assets to any other Person, then in each
case proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable), or
transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 8.03.

 



 

 **Section 8.04** ** ****Section 16 Matters**. Prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time, the Company shall take such actions as are required to cause the
disposition of Company Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs or other
convertible securities in connection with the Transactions by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **Section 8.05** ** ****Employee Matters**.

 



 

(a) For a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide the Acquired
Company Employees with (i) base salary (or wages) and cash bonus opportunities
(excluding any equity compensation) that are no less favorable than the base
salaries and cash bonus opportunities (excluding any equity compensation)
provided by the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) pension and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than those provided by the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than
those provided by the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



 

(b) Parent further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, grant all of the Acquired Company
Employees credit for any service with such Acquired Company earned prior to
the Closing Date (i) for eligibility and vesting purposes and (ii) for
purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations under any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that may be
established or that is maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (each, a " _Parent Plan_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized or
credited to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of
benefits provided to the Acquired Company Employee or to the extent that such
service was not recognized under any similar Employee Plan of the Company. In
addition, for purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision and/or other health benefits to any Acquired Company
Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause to be
waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements to the extent waived or satisfied by an Acquired
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents under any Employee Plan as
of the Closing Date and (y) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered
out-of-pocket expenses paid by any Acquired Company Employee (or covered
dependent thereof) during the portion of the plan year in which such Acquired
Company Employee participated in an Employee Plan to be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying

 



      
 

 



 

the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable Parent Plan in the applicable plan
year.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this Section 8.05 shall not (i) confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, (ii) be
construed as in any way modifying or amending the provisions of any Employee
Plan, (iii) require Parent to continue any Employee Plan or be construed to
prevent or limit Parent from terminating or modifying any Parent Plan or (
_iv_ ) require Parent to continue or maintain the employment of any Acquired
Company Employee following the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in
accordance with their terms, all employment, change in control, severance and
other compensation and benefits agreements, arrangements and policies existing
prior to the execution of this Agreement which are between the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and any director, officer, employee or consultant thereof
and set forth in Section 8.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent
hereby agrees that the occurrence of the Closing shall constitute a "Change in
Control" for purposes of any Company Executive Agreement and all Employee
Plans and related trusts set forth in Section 8.05(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

 **Section 8.06** ** ****Form S-8; Assumption of Company Compensatory
Awards**.

 



 

(a) With respect to the Company Options and Company RSUs assumed pursuant to
Section 4.05, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the assumed Company Compensatory Awards promptly,
but in any event no later than ten Business Days, following the Effective
Time. The Company and its counsel shall cooperate with and assist Parent in
the preparation of such registration statement. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Form S-8 registration statement shall not cover any Cashed Out
Compensatory Awards.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors (or,
if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall
adopt such resolutions that are necessary for the assumption and conversion of
the Company Compensatory Awards and for the treatment of Cashed Out
Compensatory Awards as set forth in Section 4.05.

 



 

 **Section 8.07** ** ****Litigation**. Each of Parent and the Company shall
promptly notify the other of any stockholder litigation against it or any of
its Representatives arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or the other Transactions and shall keep the other reasonably
informed regarding any such stockholder litigation. Each of Parent and the
Company shall give the other reasonable opportunity to consult with it
regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation and
shall give due consideration to the other partys views with respect to such
stockholder litigation.

(f) prior to the Offer Acceptance Time by Parent, if the Board of Directors of
the Company or any committee thereof shall have effected a Change of Board

Parent notifies the Company in writing of the existence of such inaccuracy or
breach (the " _Company Cure Period_ "), then Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 10.01(g) as a result of such inaccuracy or breach
prior to the earlier of (x) the expiration of the Company Cure Period and (y)

Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) or (ii) the covenants or
obligations of Parent or Acquisition Sub contained in this Agreement shall
have been breached in any material respect, in each of clauses (i) and (ii),
if such inaccuracy or breach prevents or would reasonably be expected to

_provided_ , _however_ , that if an inaccuracy or breach is curable by Parent
or Acquisition Sub during the 30-day period after the Company notifies Parent
in writing of the existence of such inaccuracy or breach (the " _Parent Cure
Period_ "), then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.01(h) as a result of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the earlier
of (x) the expiration of the Parent Cure Period and (y) the Initial End Date
(or, if the Initial End Date has been extended in accordance with Section

_further_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 10.01(h) if it is then in breach in any material respect of this
Agreement;

 



 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01

 **Section 10.02 Effect of Termination**. If this Agreement is terminated

of this Agreement; and (b) the parties hereto shall, in all events, remain
bound by and continue to be subject to the provisions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.02, this Section 10.02, Section 10.03 and
ARTICLE XI, all of which shall survive any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.01. For purposes of this Agreement, a "willful and
material breach" shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act
undertaken by the breaching party with the actual knowledge that the taking of
such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.03 Expenses; Termination Fees**.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 10.03, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with the preparation, negotiation and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not
the Offer and the Merger are consummated.

 



 

(b) If, but only if, this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) (x) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b) or Section
10.01(d) and (y) (A) an Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company or
the holders of Shares after the date hereof or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition
Proposal, (B) such Acquisition Proposal or intention to make an Acquisition
Proposal was publicly disclosed prior to the date of such termination and an
Acquisition Proposal remained pending as of the date of such termination, and
(C) within twelve months of the termination of this Agreement, (1) the Company
enters into a definitive agreement for the consummation of an Acquisition
Proposal or (2) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee within two
Business Days of the earliest to occur of such events ( _provided_ , _however_
, that for purposes of this Section 10.03(b)(i), the references to "25% or
more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "more than 50%");

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) (x) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b) or Section 10.01(d) and
(y) the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof made a Change of
Board Recommendation, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent the Company Termination Fee concurrently with such termination if the
termination takes place on a Business Day, and on the next Business Day if the
termination takes place on a day other than a Business Day;

 



 

(iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(e), then the Company shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee concurrently with
such termination if the termination takes place on a Business Day, and on the
next Business Day if the termination takes place on a day other than a
Business Day; or

 



 

(iv) by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(f), then the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee promptly, and in any
event not more than two Business Days following such termination.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this Section 10.03 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements,
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement
and (iii) any amount payable pursuant to this Section 10.03 is not a penalty,
but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent and Acquisition Sub in the circumstances in which such amount is
payable. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

 



 

(d) Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.03 shall be paid by wire
transfer of same day funds in accordance with this Section 10.03 to an account
designated by Parent, _provided_ that such payments can be delayed until the
second Business Day after the day on which Parent provides the Company with
wiring instructions and such delay will not give rise to a breach of a partys
obligations under this Section 10.03. If the Company fails to pay when due any
amount payable under this Section 10.03 or any portion of such amount, then
the Company shall pay Parent interest on such overdue amount (for the period
commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally required to be
paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually paid to Parent in
full) at the rate of interest per annum equal to the "Prime Rate" as set forth
on the date such payment became past due in _The Wall Street Journal_ "Money
Rates" column, plus 200 basis points and, if in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or Acquisition Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against
the Company for any amount payable under this Section 10.03 or any portion of
such amount, the Company shall pay to Parent and Acquisition Sub their
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in
connection with such suit.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to
Section 10.02, in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.01(b), Section 10.01(d), Section 10.01(e) or Section 10.01(f), the
Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section 10.03 and the
Company has paid the Company Termination Fee to

 



      
 

 



 

Parent in accordance with this Section 10.03, Parents receipt of the Company
Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to Section 10.03(b)(i)(iv), as the
case may be, and the payment of any amounts due pursuant to Section 10.03(d)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Acquisition Sub against
(i) the Company and (ii) any of the Companys former, current and future
Affiliates, assignees, stockholders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys and other Representatives (the Persons described
in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") for any
losses or damages arising from or relating to this Agreement, any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and none of the Company Parties
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that the foregoing shall not impair the rights of Parent to
obtain injunctive relief pursuant to Section 11.02 prior to any termination of
this Agreement.

waiver is to be effective.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 



 

 **Section 11.05 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment**.

change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or
Acquisition Sub, and _provided_ , _further_ , that no such transfer or
assignment shall be permitted if it would result in the imposition of any
withholding Tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Section 11.05(b) shall be void.

 



 

 **Section 11.06 Governing Law**. This Agreement shall be governed by and

connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the
matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in
any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, and
covenants not to assert or plead any objection it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such
court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



 

 **Section 11.08 Waiver of Jury Trial**. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING

in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed

oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 11.11 Severability**. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement or the application thereof is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the

 **ANNEX I**

 



 

 ** _CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER_**

 



 

(1) Notwithstanding any other terms or provisions of the Offer or the
Agreement and Plan of Merger to which this **Annex I** is attached (the "
_Agreement_ "), Acquisition Sub shall not be obligated to accept for payment,
and, subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule 14e-l(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act), shall not be obligated to pay for, or may
delay the acceptance for payment of or payment for, any validly tendered
Shares pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid
for), if immediately prior to the Expiration Date, there shall not have been
validly tendered (not including any Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that were not actually delivered prior to the Expiration
Date) and not validly withdrawn that number of Shares that would represent one
Share more than one-half (1/2) of the sum of:

 



 

(a) all Shares then outstanding, and

 



 

(b) all Shares that the Company may be required to issue upon the vesting
(including vesting solely as a result of the consummation of the Offer),
conversion, settlement or exercise of all then outstanding warrants, options,
benefit plans, obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable into
Shares, or other rights to acquire or be issued Shares (including all then
outstanding Company Compensatory Awards), regardless of the conversion or
exercise price or other terms and conditions thereof (such condition in this
clause (1) being the " _Minimum Condition_ ").

 



 

(2) Notwithstanding any other term or provision of the Offer or the Agreement,
and in addition to (and not in limitation of) Acquisition Subs rights to
extend and amend the Offer (subject to the provisions of the Agreement), and
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, Acquisition Sub
shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for any Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer if at the Expiration Date (i) the Minimum Condition has
not been satisfied, or (ii) any of the following conditions shall not be
satisfied or have been waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub:

 



 

(a) the representations and warranties made by the Company contained in
Section 5.07(b) of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as
of the date of the Agreement;

 



 

(b) the representations and warranties made by the Company contained in
Section 5.05(a) and the first sentence of Section 5.05(b) of the Agreement
shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Agreement and
as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of the Expiration Date
(except to the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly
speaks of a specified earlier date, in which case such representation and
warranty need only be true and correct as of such specified earlier date),
except for any failures to be so true and correct that, individually or in the
aggregate, are _de minimis_ (it being understood that any failures to be true
and correct shall be deemed to be " _de minimis_ " if and only if the
Companys fully diluted capitalization as of the applicable determination date
does not exceed the Companys

 



      
 

 



 

fully diluted capitalization set forth in Section 5.05(a) and the first
sentence of Section 5.05(b) by more than 0.50% in the aggregate);

 



 

(c) the representations and warranties made by the Company contained in
Section 5.01(a) (solely as it applies to the due incorporation and valid
existence of the Company), Section 5.02, Section 5.04 (solely as it applies to
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company), Section 5.05(e)
and Section 5.22 of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as
though made on and as of the Expiration Date (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks of a specified earlier date,
in which case such representation and warranty need only be true and correct
as of such specified earlier date), without giving effect to any "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualifications, or any similar
qualifications or limitations contained or incorporated directly or indirectly
in such representations and warranties;

 



 

(d) the representations and warranties made by the Company contained in
Section 5.05 (other than Section 5.05(a), the first sentence of Section
5.05(b) and Section 5.05(e)) of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as
though made on and as of the Expiration Date (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks of a specified earlier date,
in which case such representation and warranty need only be true and correct
as of such specified earlier date), except for any failures to be so true and
correct that, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to the
Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, and without giving effect to any
"Company Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualifications, or any
similar qualifications or limitations contained or incorporated directly or
indirectly in such representations and warranties;

 



 

(e) all other representations and warranties made by the Company in the
Agreement (other than those referred to in clauses 2(a), (b), (c) and (d)
above) shall have been true and correct in all respects as of the date of the
Agreement and shall be true and correct in all respects as of the Expiration
Date as if made on the Expiration Date (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks of a specified earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty need only be true and correct in
all respects as of such specified earlier date), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect and without giving effect to any "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualifications, or any similar
qualifications or limitations contained or incorporated directly or indirectly
in such representations and warranties;

 



 

(f) the Company shall have complied with or performed in all material respects
all covenants and obligations that the Company is required to comply with or
to perform at or prior to the Expiration Date;

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Parent shall have received a certificate executed on behalf of the Company
by its Chief Executive Officer to the effect that the conditions set forth in
clauses (2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above have been duly satisfied;

 



 

(h) The waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
terminated;

 



 

(i) since the date of the Agreement, there shall not have occurred any Company
Material Adverse Effect that is continuing;

 



 

(j) no Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction or other Applicable Law shall be in effect
which makes illegal, restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits or prevents the
acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Shares pursuant to the Offer or
consummation of the Offer or the Merger; and

 



 

(k) the Agreement shall not have been validly terminated in accordance with
its terms.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition
Sub and may be waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub, in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and
Acquisition Sub; provided that the Minimum Condition may be waived by Parent
and Acquisition Sub only with the prior written consent of the Company, which
may be granted or withheld in the Companys sole discretion. The failure by
Parent or Acquisition Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to
time. All capitalized terms used but not defined in this Annex I shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.
