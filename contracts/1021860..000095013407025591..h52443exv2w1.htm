subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (&#147;Company Common Stock&#148;) not owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company, and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive (1)

and (2)&nbsp;cash consideration (the &#147;Cash Consideration&#148; and, collectively with such Parent Common

exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock and the Cash Consideration

surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange

if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, a certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock
