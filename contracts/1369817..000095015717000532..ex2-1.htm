Section 1.05 _Board of Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The

ARTICLE II

  


 

  

 _EFFECT ON THE SHARE CAPITAL OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES; PAYMENT OF
CONSIDERATION_

  


 

  

Section 2.01 _Effect of Merger on the Share Capital of Merger Sub and the
Company_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Merger,
and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Holdco, Merger Sub
or any holder of any Class A common shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (" _Class A Shares_ ") or Class B common shares, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (" _Class B Shares_ " and, together with Class A Shares,
" _Company Shares_ ") or any shares, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub
(" _Merger Sub Shares_ "):

  


 

  

(a) _Cancelation of Share Capital of Merger Sub_. All Merger Sub Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by Holdco
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled in
consideration, together with the Merger Consideration paid by a Subsidiary of
Parent incorporated under the laws of Bermuda pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ ,
for the Company Shares transferred to Holdco pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ and
shall cease to exist and be outstanding.

  


 

  

(b) _Cancelation of Shares Held by Merger Sub_. All Company Shares that are
owned by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and be outstanding and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  


 

  

(c) _Transfer of Company Shares_. Subject to _Sections 2.01(b)_ and _2.05_ ,
each Company Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than any Company Share that is subject to any Company
Award, shall automatically as a result of the Merger be transferred by the
holders thereof to Holdco in exchange for the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to $18.10, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
Subject to _Section 2.05_ , as of the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced any Company
Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or uncertificated Company Shares
represented by book-entry immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Book-Entry Share_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pertaining to the Company
Shares represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, to
be paid in consideration therefor, in accordance with _Section 2.02(b)_ or
_Section 2.02(e)_ , and the right to receive dividends and other distributions
in accordance with this _Article II_ , in each case without interest.

  


 

  

Section 2.02 _Exchange Fund_.

  


 

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than three (3) business days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
for the payment and delivery of the

  

  

 

3  

  

  

aggregate Merger Consideration payable to holders of Class A Shares in
accordance with this _Article II_ and, in connection therewith, shall enter
into an agreement with the Paying Agent prior to the Closing Date in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall (i) ensure that one of its Subsidiaries incorporated in Bermuda has an
amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Class A Shares and (ii) cause such Subsidiary to deposit such
amount in cash with the Paying Agent (such cash, and the cash referred to in
the immediately following sentence, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). From time to time as necessary, Parent shall ensure that
one of its Subsidiaries incorporated in Bermuda shall have sufficient funds
to, and cause such Subsidiary to, promptly deposit with the Paying Agent
additional cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions
payable to holders of Class A Shares pursuant to _Section 2.02(g)_. Pending
its disbursement in accordance with this _Section 2.02_ , the Exchange Fund
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term
direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii)
short-term commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Services or (iv)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion. Any and all interest
earned on the Exchange Fund shall be paid by the Paying Agent to Parent.
Parent shall ensure that one of its Subsidiaries incorporated in Bermuda shall
have sufficient funds to, and cause such Subsidiary to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
all payments to former holders of Class A Shares of the Merger Consideration
and any dividends and other distributions payable pursuant to _Section
2.02(g)_. No investment losses resulting from investment of the funds
deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any former holder
of Class A Shares to receive the Merger Consideration or any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.02(g)_ pertaining thereto
as provided herein. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than the payment to holders of Class A Shares of the Merger Consideration and
of any dividends and other distributions payable pursuant to _Section
2.02(g)_.

  


 

  

(b) _Letter of Transmittal; Exchange of Class A Shares_. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3)
business days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Company or Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced any Class A Shares (" _Class
A Certificates_ ") a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in such
form and have such other customary provisions as the Surviving Company may
specify, subject to the Company's reasonable approval (to be obtained prior to
the Effective Time)), together with instructions thereto, setting forth, inter
alia, the procedures by which holders of Class A Certificates may receive the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which they
are entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. Holders of Class A Book-Entry
Shares shall not be required to deliver a Class A Certificate but shall, if
required by the Paying Agent, be required to deliver an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the Merger Consideration
such holder is entitled to pursuant to this _Article II_. Upon the completion
of such applicable procedures by a holder and the surrender of such holder's
Class A Certificates, and, except as contemplated by the previous sentence,
without any action by any

  

  

 

4  

  

  

holder of record of Book-Entry Shares that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any Class A Shares (" _Class A Book-Entry Shares_ "), the
Paying Agent shall deliver to such holder (other than any holder of Class A
Shares representing Dissenting Shares), (A) in the case of Class A Book-Entry
Shares, a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger and (B) cash in an amount
(subject to _Section 2.02(h)_ ) equal to the number of Class A Shares
represented by such Class A Certificate or Class A Book-Entry Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger
Consideration, and such Class A Certificates or Class A Book-Entry Shares
shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Class A Certificate
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the
Class A Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such
payment shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Company that any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder either
has been paid or is not applicable. Until satisfaction of the applicable
procedures contemplated by this _Section 2.02_ and subject to _Section 2.05_ ,
each Class A Certificate or Class A Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions pertaining to
Class A Shares formerly represented by such Class A Certificate or Class A
Book-Entry Share as contemplated by _Section 2.02(g)_. No interest shall be
paid or shall accrue on the cash payable with respect to Class A Shares
pursuant to this _Article II_.

  


 

  

(c) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Class A Certificates_. If any Class A
Certificate (other than Class A Certificates representing Dissenting Shares)
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Class A Certificate to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Company, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Class A
Certificate, the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Class A Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to be
paid in respect of Class A Shares formerly represented by such Class A
Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

  


 

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the one hundred and
eightieth (180th) day after the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had
been delivered to the Paying Agent and which has not been disbursed to former
holders of Class A Shares, and thereafter such former holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for, and Parent and
the Surviving Company shall remain liable for, payment of their claims of the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions pertaining to
their former Class A Shares that such former holders have the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its
designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  

  

 

5  

  


 

  

(e) _Exchange of Class B Shares_. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time evidenced any Class B Shares (" _Class B Certificates_ ") shall
surrender the Class B Certificates held by such holder to the Surviving
Company in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the surrender of such
holder's Class B Certificates, Parent shall (i) ensure that one of its
Subsidiaries incorporated in Bermuda has sufficient funds to make a wire
transfer to an account designated by such holder of Class B Shares of cash in
an amount (subject to _Section 2.02(h)_ ) equal to the number of Class B
Shares represented by such Class B Certificate immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration and (ii) cause such
Subsidiary to make such wire transfer, and such Class B Certificates shall
forthwith be canceled. Until satisfaction of the applicable procedures
contemplated by this _Section 2.02_ and subject to _Section 2.05_ , each Class
B Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends
or other distributions pertaining to Class B Shares formerly represented by
such Class B Certificate as contemplated by _Section 2.02(g)_. No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable with respect to Class B
Shares pursuant to this _Article II_.

  


 

  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

  


 

  

(g) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of each Company Share in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares previously
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to
(i) _Section 2.05_ and (ii) the Surviving Company's obligation to pay any
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that have been declared by the Company on Company Shares not in
violation of the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective
Time, the share transfer books of the Surviving Company shall be updated to
reflect the transfer of Company Shares to Parent in accordance with the terms
herein. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares
formerly represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
underlying Company Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of _Section 2.02(d)_ , if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented
to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article II_.

  


 

  

(h) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), or under any provision of other applicable Tax Law. To the extent amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental

  

  

 

6  

  

  

Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

  


 

  

Section 2.03 _Company Equity Awards_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any duly-authorized committee thereof
administering the Company Share Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take
such other actions as may be required to provide the following, effective upon
the Effective Time, subject to _Section 2.02(h)_ :

  


 

  

(i) each restricted Company Share granted under a Company Share Plan (a "
_Company Restricted Share_ ) that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the sum of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii)
any Per Share Accrued Dividends in respect of such Company Restricted Share;
_provided_ that the service-based vesting conditions of such Company
Restricted Share shall continue to apply in accordance with the terms of such
Company Restricted Share agreement and applicable Company Share Plan, and such
cash amount (other than any Per Share Accrued Dividends) shall be paid upon
the satisfaction of such vesting conditions; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
Per Share Accrued Dividends in respect of such Company Restricted Share shall
become payable upon the Effective Time;

  


 

  

(ii) each restricted share unit award in respect of Company Shares granted
under a Company Share Plan that is subject solely to service-based vesting
requirements and not performance-based vesting requirements (a " _Company
Fixed RSU Award_ ) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the sum of the Merger Consideration plus
any Per Share Accrued Dividends in respect of a Company Share subject to such
Company Fixed RSU Award, multiplied by (y) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Company Fixed RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that the service-based vesting conditions of such Company
Fixed RSU Award shall continue to apply in accordance with the terms of such
Company Fixed RSU Award agreement and applicable Company Share Plan, and such
cash amount shall be paid in accordance with the vesting and payment schedules
applicable to such Company Fixed RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time;

  


 

  

(iii) each restricted share unit award in respect of Company Shares granted
under a Company Share Plan that is designated as " _Performance Shares_ " (as
defined in the applicable Company Share Plan) (a " _Company Performance Share
Award_ "), that has a grant date prior to January 1, 2016 and that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product
of (x) the sum of the Merger Consideration plus any Per Share Accrued
Dividends in respect of a Company Share subject to such Company Performance
Share Award, multiplied by (y) the target number of Company Shares subject to
such Company Performance Share Award immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that the service-based vesting conditions of such Company
Performance Share Award shall continue to apply in accordance with the terms
of such Company Performance Share Award agreement and applicable Company Share

  

  

 

7  

  

  

Plan, and such cash amount shall be paid in accordance with the vesting and
payment schedules applicable to such Company Performance Share Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time;

  


 

  

(iv) each Company Performance Share Award that has a grant date on or after
January 1, 2016 and is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
" _Post-2015 Company Performance Share Award_ ") shall continue on the same
terms and conditions as applicable to such Company Performance Share Award as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (i) as set forth on Section
2.03 of the Company Disclosure Letter, (ii) as provided in Section 2.03(b)
hereof and (iii) such Company Performance Share Award shall be settled in cash
equal to the product of (x) the sum of the Merger Consideration plus any Per
Share Accrued Dividends in respect of a Company Share subject to such Company
Performance Share Award, multiplied by (y) the target number of Company Shares
subject to such Company Performance Share Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (z) the " _Performance Percentage_ " (within the
meaning of the applicable Company Performance Share Award agreement),
determined after taking into account the adjustments set forth in Section 2.03
of the Company Disclosure Letter;

  


 

  

(v) each restricted share unit award granted under a Company Share Plan that
is designated as " _Performance Units_ " (as defined in the applicable Company
Share Plan) (a " _Company Performance Unit Award_ "), that has a grant date
prior to January 1, 2016 and that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (x) the "Unit Value" (as defined in
the applicable Company Performance Unit Award agreement), multiplied by (y)
the target number of units subject to such Company Performance Unit Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the service-based
vesting conditions of such Company Performance Unit Award shall continue to
apply in accordance with the terms of such Company Performance Unit Award
agreement and applicable Company Share Plan, and such cash amount shall be
paid in accordance with the vesting and payment schedules applicable to such
Company Performance Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

  


 

  

(vi) each Company Performance Unit Award that has a grant date on or after
January 1, 2016 and is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
" _Post-2015 Company Performance Unit Award_ ") shall continue on the same
terms and conditions as applicable to such Company Performance Unit Award as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (i) as set forth on Section
2.03 of the Company Disclosure Letter, (ii) as provided in Section 2.03(b)
hereof and (iii) such Company Performance Unit Award shall be settled in cash
only.

  


 

  

(b) Except as specifically provided in this _Section 2.03_ , following the
Effective Time, each such Company Award shall otherwise be subject to the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to the Company Awards under the
Company Share Plan and Company Award agreements immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that all references to the Company in the Company Share
Plan and the applicable Company Award agreements shall be deemed to refer to
Surviving Company, which shall have assumed the Company Share

  

  

 

8  

  

  

Plan as of the Effective Time by virtue of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and without any further action, and all references to a
Company Share shall be deemed to be the right to receive the amounts set forth
in this _Section 2.03_ , in cash. For the avoidance of doubt, without limiting
any rights enjoyed by the holders of Company Awards with respect to vesting or
otherwise, or any right to accelerate vesting under the Company Share Plans,
related award agreements thereunder or other individual agreements, (i)
Company Awards shall be afforded the "double-trigger" vesting protections as
set forth in the applicable Company Share Plan; _provided_ that a relocation
of a holder's principal place of employment by more than 35 miles from his or
her principal place of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall also be treated as a "Constructive Termination" event enabling such
holder to terminate employment in a "Trigger Event" (as such terms are defined
in the applicable Company Share Plan), and (ii) the consummation of the
Transactions shall constitute a "change in control" or "change of control" (or
term of similar import) for purposes of such provisions. Further, for the
avoidance of doubt, if any Company Award (other than a Post-2015 Company
Performance Share Award or Post-2015 Company Performance Unit Award)
contemplates that actual performance achievement shall apply in determining
vesting or payment upon certain terminations of employment ( _e.g._ , death,
disability or retirement), the number of shares or units determined using
target performance achievement as provided in this _Section 2.03_ shall apply
instead.

  


 

  

(c) _Right of Holders_. If the Effective Time occurs, the holders of Company
Awards shall have the right to enforce, and shall be beneficiaries with
respect to, the provisions of this _Section 2.03_ and _Section 2.04_ , as they
may be amended from time to time prior to the Closing.

  


 

  

Section 2.04 _Payments with Respect to Company Equity Awards_. Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in any event, not later than seventy-four (74) days
following the Effective Time), the Surviving Company shall pay to the holders
of Company Awards, through its payroll systems, any amounts due pursuant to
_Section 2.03_ in respect of any then-vested Company Awards. Further, with
respect to the vesting of any Company Award occurring after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall pay to the holder thereof, promptly
following such vesting date (but in any event, not later than seventy-four
(74) days following such date), or upon such other payment date explicitly
provided in the applicable award agreement or Company Share Plan or as may be
set forth in an applicable separation and release agreement with the relevant
holder, through its payroll systems, any amounts due pursuant to _Section
2.03_ in respect of any then-vested Company Awards.

  


 

  

Section 2.05 _Shares of Dissenting Holders_.

  


 

  

(a) At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall automatically be
transferred in exchange, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, for the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_ , and
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall, in the event that the fair value of a
Dissenting Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section
106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act (the " _Appraised Fair Value_ ") is
greater than the Merger Consideration, be entitled to receive such difference
from the Surviving Company by payment made within thirty (30) days after such
Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such appraisal
procedure.

  

  

 

9  

  


 

  

(b) In the event that a holder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or
otherwise waives any right to appraisal (each, an " _Appraisal Withdrawal_ "),
such holder's Dissenting Shares shall be transferred in exchange as of the
Effective Time for the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such
Company Share.

  


 

  

(a) The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice of (A) any demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Company Shares, Appraisal
Withdrawals and any other written instruments, notices, petitions or other
communication received by the Company in connection with the foregoing, in
each case, pursuant to the provisions of the Bermuda Companies Act concerning
the rights of holders of Company Shares to require appraisal of such Company
Shares in accordance with this _Section 2.05_ and (B) to the extent that the
Company has Knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme Court of
Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii) to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with
the Company in any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
demands for appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act. The Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, offer to settle or settle any such demands or applications, or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or to
timely take any other action to exercise appraisal rights in accordance with
the Bermuda Companies Act. Payment of any amount payable to holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be the obligation of the Surviving Company.

  


 

  

Section 2.06 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article II_
to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the issued and outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any share dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such share dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

  


 

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub that,
except as (A) set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub on the date of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood that any information set forth on
one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
apply to and qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure
that such information is relevant to such other section or subsection) or (B)
disclosed in any report, schedule, form, statement or other document filed
with the SEC since January 1, 2016 by the Company and publicly available at
least two (2) business days prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed

"Forward-Looking Statements" sections of such Company Filed SEC Documents or
that otherwise constitute risk factors or forward-looking

  

  

 

10  

  

  

statements, or of any risks generally faced by participants in the industries
in which the Company operates, in each case, to the extent such sections,
statements or risks do not disclose specific facts and circumstances:

  


 

  

Section 3.01 _Organization; Standing_.

  


 

  

(a) The Company is an exempted limited liability company duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Bermuda. The Company
has all requisite power and authority necessary to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted and to own, lease and operate its assets and properties
in all material respects. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. A true and complete
copy of each of the Company Organizational Documents is included in the Filed
SEC Documents. The Company is not in violation of the Company Organizational
Documents and no Subsidiary of the Company is in violation of any of its
organizational documents, except, in each case, as would not be material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  


 

  

(b) Each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly incorporated or organized,
validly existing and in good standing (where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, except where the failure to be so incorporated or organized,
existing and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

Section 3.02 _Capitalization_.

  


 

  

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company consists of 200,000,000 Class
A Shares, 200,000,000 Class B Shares and 80,000 preference shares, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Preference Shares_ "). At the
close of business on April 28, 2017 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "), (i)

outstanding Company Performance Share Awards and Company Performance Unit
Awards (assuming attainment of all applicable performance goals at the maximum
level for payout and conversion into Class A Shares using the closing share
price of a Class A Share on the Capitalization Date). Since the Capitalization
Date through the date of this Agreement, other than in connection with the
vesting or settlement of Company Awards in accordance with their terms,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has issued any Company
Securities.

  


 

  

(b) Except as described in this _Section 3.02_ , as of the Capitalization

to grant, extend or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible
or exchangeable security or other similar agreement or commitment relating to
any Company Shares, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company

and (iv) being referred to collectively as " _Company Securities_ ") and (v)
no other obligations by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any
payments based on the price or value of any Company Securities or dividends
paid thereon. Other than in connection with the Company Awards, there are no
outstanding agreements or instruments of any kind that obligate the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Securities (or obligate the Company to grant, extend or enter into any such
agreements relating to any Company Securities) or that grant from the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries any preemptive rights, subscription rights, anti-
dilutive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights with respect to any
Company Securities. Except as described in this _Section 3.02_ , no direct or
indirect Subsidiary of the Company owns any Company Shares. Other than the
Registration Rights Agreement, none of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is a party to any shareholders' agreement, voting trust agreement,
registration rights agreement or other similar agreement or understanding
relating to any Company Securities or any other agreement relating to the
disposition, voting or dividends with respect to any Company Securities. All
issued and outstanding Company Shares have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. The
Class A Shares and the 4.60% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 issued pursuant
to the Notes Indenture constitute the only outstanding classes of securities
of the Company or its Subsidiaries registered pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the " _Exchange Act_ "). The Class A Shares are the
only outstanding class of securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries
registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

(c) _Section 3.02(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, the name and jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization of each material Subsidiary of the Company. All of the issued and
outstanding share capital or shares of capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company (except for directors'
qualifying shares or the like) are owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially
and of record, by the Company free and clear of all Liens, except for such
Liens as may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities
Act_ ") or other applicable securities Laws (including any restriction on the
right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such share capital, shares of
capital stock or other equity or voting interests). Each issued and
outstanding share capital or share of capital stock of each Subsidiary of the
Company that is held, directly or indirectly, by the Company, is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, and there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls,

right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or
agreement, any agreements granting any preemptive rights, subscription rights,
anti-dilutive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights (to Persons
other than the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company) with respect to any
securities of any Subsidiary of the Company. None of the Subsidiaries of the
Company has any outstanding equity compensation plans relating to the share
capital or capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any
Subsidiary of the Company.

Organizational Documents or (B) the similar organizational documents of any of
the Company's Subsidiaries or (ii) assuming (A) compliance with the matters

assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties made in such
_Section 4.02(c)_ ), (B)

Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ , not, directly or indirectly, (A)

agreement or agreement in principle with respect to a Takeover Proposal.
Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, to the
extent it had not previously done so prior to the date of this Agreement,
deliver a request to each Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement
with the Company during the eighteen (18) months prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with considering or making a Takeover Proposal (an "
_Existing Confidentiality Agreement_ ") to promptly return or destroy any non-
public information previously furnished or made available to such Person or
any of its Representatives on behalf of the Company or its Representatives.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 5.02(a)_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if at any time prior to obtaining
the Required Shareholder Approvals the Company receives a bona fide Takeover
Proposal after the date of this Agreement which Takeover Proposal did not
result from any breach of this _Section 5.02_ (provided that, solely for
purposes of determining whether a breach of the first sentence of Section
5.02(a) has occurred for purposes of this Section 5.02(b), the Company's
obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to
comply with the first sentence of Section 5.02(a) shall be a covenant (without
qualification of reasonable best efforts) to cause its Representatives to
comply with clauses (i) and (iii) of Section 5.02(a)), then (i) the Company
and its Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons making the
Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof or to
request that any Takeover Proposal made orally be made in writing and (ii) if
the Company Board determines in good faith after

  

  

 

39  

  

  

consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (x)
negotiate and enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the
Person or group of Persons making the Takeover Proposal and furnish pursuant
thereto information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made
such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly provide to
Parent copies of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ further
that the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any material non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided
to any Person given such access that was not previously provided to Parent or
its Representatives and (y) after entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal.

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) notify Parent in the event that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a Takeover Proposal and

Takeover Proposal and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making
such Takeover Proposal and unredacted copies of all material correspondence or

summaries of any material oral communications). The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material developments with

communications as contemplated above). The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 5.02(c)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to

fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10)
business days after receipt of a written request by Parent to make such public
reaffirmation following the receipt by the Company of a public Takeover
Proposal (other than in the case of a Takeover Proposal in the form of a
tender offer or exchange offer covered by clause (D)) that has not been
withdrawn; _provided_ that Parent may make any such request only once in any
ten (10) business day period and only once for each such public Takeover
Proposal and once for each public material amendment to such Takeover Proposal
(any action described in this clause (1) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ", it being understood that a customary "stop, look or
listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the

  

  

 

40  

  

  

Exchange Act shall not be prohibited and shall not, in and of itself,
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change) or (2) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, amalgamation agreement or other similar agreement
related to any Takeover Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.02(b)_ (each, a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time the Required Shareholder
Approvals are obtained, the Company Board may, so long as the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Representatives have not breached this _Section 5.02_
(provided that, solely for purposes of determining whether a breach of the
first sentence of Section 5.02(a) has occurred for purposes of this Section
5.02(d), the Company's obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to comply with the first sentence of Section 5.02(a) shall
be a covenant (without qualification of reasonable best efforts) to cause its
Representatives to comply with clauses (i) and (iii) of Section 5.02(a)):

  


 

  

(i) in response to an Intervening Event, if the Company Board, acting with the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Designated Directors, has determined in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would violate the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, make an Adverse Recommendation Change; and

  


 

  

(ii) in response to a Superior Proposal, if the Company Board, acting with the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Designated Directors, has determined in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would violate the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (A) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.01(d)(ii)_ , pay the Company Termination Fee and enter
into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal;

  


 

  

 _provided_ that the Company and the Company Board shall not take any such
action unless the Company has given Parent at least four (4) business days'
prior written notice (a " _Company Notice_ ") of its intention to take any
such action, which notice (A) in the case of an Intervening Event, specifies
material changes, developments, effects, circumstances, states of facts or
events comprising such Intervening Event and (B) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, discloses (I) the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such
Superior Proposal and its or their financing sources (if applicable), and (II)
a copy of the most current version of the Company Acquisition Agreement (if
any) with respect to such Superior Proposal and any agreement in the Company's
possession relating to the financing of such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that during such four (4) business day period (it being understood
and agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms and
conditions of a Superior Proposal shall require an additional Company Notice
to Parent of two (2) business days running from the date of such notice), (X)
the Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such commercially reasonable adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company Board to no longer
make an Adverse

  

  

 

41  

  

  

Recommendation Change or determination that a Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (Y) the Company Board shall have determined following
the end of such period, after considering the results of such negotiations and
the revised proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with the
Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel, (i) that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to such Company Notice continues to be a Superior
Proposal or (ii) that failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in
respect of the applicable Intervening Event would violate the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

  


 

  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from
(i) taking and disclosing to shareholders of the Company a position or
communication contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure or communication to shareholders of the Company that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is required by the directors'
fiduciary duties or applicable Law; _provided_ that if any such public
disclosure by the Company or the Company Board contemplated by clause (i) or
(ii) above relating to a Takeover Proposal has the substantive effect of
withdrawing, withholding or adversely modifying, qualifying or amending the
Company Board Recommendation or approving or endorsing a Takeover Proposal and
meets the requirements set forth in _Section 5.02(d)(1)_ , such disclosure
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company
Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such disclosure (it being
understood that any "stop, look or listen" communication pursuant to Rule

to this Agreement and the Transactions (excluding any personally sensitive

Section 5.06 _Public Announcements; Other Communications_. Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the

Section 5.07 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parent's
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Company's officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and

Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets,
liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that
Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to provide such access or information if the Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, waive the
protection of an attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege or expose
the Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company
does not provide access or information in reliance on the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding
such access or information and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of
such privilege. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section
5.07_ shall be directed to the Person designated by the Company. Until the
Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to the terms of the

_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  


 

  

Section 5.08 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  


 

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the
Company (each, together with such Person's heirs, executors and
administrators, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ")
with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever
asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that
an Indemnitee

  

  

 

47  

  

  

was a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or
omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with
serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director,
officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including
any employee benefit plan)), in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at
any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole
or in part to the Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any
Indemnitee), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_
that no Indemnitee shall be indemnified against any liability which by virtue
of any rule of law attaches to such Indemnitee in respect of any fraud or
dishonesty of which such Indemnitee has been finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be guilty of in relation to the Company, and (ii)
assume all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the
Company Organizational Documents and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement in
existence as of the date of this Agreement providing for indemnification
between the Company and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, the memorandum of association and bye-laws of the
Surviving Company to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees
with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Company Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, advance any expenses (including
fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this _Section
5.08_ (including in connection with enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations referred to in this _Section 5.08_ ) as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ that the individual to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it
shall be finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section 5.08(a)_.

  


 

  

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
_Section 5.08_ (each, a " _Claim_ ") for which indemnification has been sought
by an Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability
arising out of such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to
such settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company
and the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall
provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  


 

  

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall substitute the current directors' and officers'
liability insurance of the Company and its Subsidiaries covering acts or
omissions occurring at or

  

  

 

48  

  

  

prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals who are
currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective Time
become) covered by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
of the Company and its Subsidiaries with a "tail" policy, issued by reputable
insurers, on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no
less favorable to such individuals than those of such policies in effect on
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the annual
premium for such insurance shall exceed 300% of the current annual premium
(such 300% threshold, the " _Maximum Premium_ "), then Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best
coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium. The Company may prior to the Effective Time purchase, for an
aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate Maximum Premium for six (6)
years, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing at
least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors'
and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions. If such prepaid
"tail" policy has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy
all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this _Section 5.08(c)_ and the
Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy
to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all
of its obligations thereunder.

  


 

  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.08_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the Company Organizational Documents, by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this
_Section 5.08_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.08_
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 5.08_ applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.08_ ).

  


 

  

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or entity of such
consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this _Section 5.08_.

  


 

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.08_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  

  

 

49  

  


 

  

Section 5.09 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

Section 5.10 _Employee Matters_.

  


 

  

(a) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on the latest of
(x) the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Time, (y) December 31, 2018
and (z) the time required by applicable Law (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, each
individual who continues to be employed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ ")
with (i) salary and target annual cash incentive opportunities that are each
no less favorable than the salary and target annual cash incentive
opportunities provided to such Company Employee by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate than those
provided to such Company Employee by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.10(a)_ , from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, assume,
honor and, during the Continuation Period or, if later, until all obligations
thereunder have been satisfied, continue without any amendment or modification
(other than any amendment or modification required to comply with applicable
Law), the Company's employment, severance (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the severance plan described in _Section 5.01(a)(iv)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter), retention, termination and change-in-control plans,
policies, programs, agreements and arrangements maintained by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as in effect at the Effective Time and
listed on _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, including with
respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the
Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event) and
specifically the "double-trigger" vesting protections as set forth in the
applicable Company Share Plan, as referenced in _Section 2.03(b)_. Further,
the amounts of any such severance, retention, termination and change-in-
control payments shall be no less favorable than those as calculated using the
salary or hourly wage rate or other compensation, as applicable, provided to
such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) With respect to any accrued but unused paid time off to which any Company
Employee is entitled pursuant to the paid time off policy or individual
agreement or other arrangement applicable to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Paid Time Off Policy_ "), Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to (i) allow such Company Employee to use such
accrued paid time off consistent with the generally applicable policies of the
Surviving Company for use of paid time off and (ii) if any Company Employee's
employment terminates during the Continuation Period, pay the Company
Employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the accrued paid time off
to the same extent that the Company Employee would have received a cash
payment therefor under the Paid Time Off Policy as in effect as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

 

50  

  


 

  

(d) With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Company and their respective Affiliates providing any benefits to any Company
Employee after the Effective Time, including any "employee benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any paid time off and severance
plans), for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, and vesting (and excluding benefit accruals and early retirement
subsidies under any defined benefit pension plan (other than any Company Plan
in effect as of the Effective Time and listed on _Section 3.10(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter)), each Company Employee's service with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer
of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall
be treated as service with the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for
the same period of service.

  


 

  

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to use commercially
reasonable efforts to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time,
except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been
satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, recognize the dollar amount of all co-
payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee
(and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and
co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they

(f) For purposes of any Company Plan containing a definition of "change in
control" or "change of control" (or term of similar import), the occurrence of
the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of
control" (or such term of similar import) under such Company Plan. Any
definition of "Constructive Termination" in any Company Plan (including the

of a participant's principal place of employment by more than 35 miles from
their principal place of performance immediately prior to the Effective Time.

set forth in Section 5.10(g)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, (ii) each
Company Employee who participates in the Company's long-term cash plan in

the terms set forth in Section 5.10(g)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and (iii) the payments described in Section 5.10(g)(iii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  

  

 

51  

  


 

  

(h) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 5.10_ is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or, except as
provided in _Section 5.10(f)_ , an amendment to any employee benefit plan for
purposes of ERISA or otherwise and, except as provided in _Section 2.03(c)_ ,
no current or former employee or any other individual associated therewith

Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the "
_Notes Indenture_ ") and (ii) comply with the applicable provisions of the
Notes Indenture, including the delivery of any officers' certificate and
opinion of counsel required thereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, the term
"Transactions" shall include the execution of such supplemental indenture.

  


 

  

(b) If requested by Parent, the Company shall provide reasonable cooperation
to Parent, Holdco and Merger Sub in arranging for, at the Closing, the
termination of existing Indebtedness (including of the Existing Credit

shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate, and to cause its Representatives to

operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, (B)
the Company shall not be required to incur or commit to any

  

  

 

52  

  

  

obligation or liability in connection with any such Financing prior to the
Closing Date unless contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, (C) such
requested cooperation shall not be required to the extent that it would result
in a significant modification within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1001-3 unless contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, and (D)
the Closing shall in no event be conditioned or contingent upon any such
Financing and (E) the Company shall not be obligated to cooperate with respect
to, any such Financing to the extent that such Financing would reasonably be
expected to prevent, or impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any
material respect the consummation of the Transactions.

  


 

  

(c) The Company shall cooperate with and provide commercially reasonable
assistance to Parent in connection with this _Section 5.12_ , including
executing and delivering, at the Closing, any officer's certificates of the
Company reasonably requested by Parent. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of outside legal
counsel) in connection with any and all of the matters contemplated by
_Section 5.12(b)_ and this _Section 5.12(c)_ (other than arising from fraud or
dishonesty on the part of the Company or its Subsidiaries), whether or not the
Transactions are consummated or this Agreement is terminated. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable
out of pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with _Section 5.12(b)_ and this
_Section 5.12(c)_ whether or not the Transactions are consummated or this
Agreement is terminated.

  


 

  

Section 5.13 _Merger Sub Shareholder Approval_. Immediately following the
execution of this Agreement, Holdco shall execute and deliver, in accordance
with Section 106 of the Bermuda Companies Act and in its capacity as the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, a written consent approving this Agreement, the

their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's securities to
be de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange and de-registered under the
Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time.

  


 

  

Section 5.15 _Actions with Respect to Certain Company Arrangements_.

  


 

  

(a) Concurrently with the Closing, the Company shall cause the Transition
Services Agreement and the Investment Management Agreement to be duly executed
by the parties thereto.

  


 

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Registration Rights Agreement and the Separation

the Registration Rights Agreement, following the Effective Time, Parent, the
Company and their respective Affiliates shall not have any further liability
or obligation whatsoever thereunder.

Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

  


 

  

(ii) prior to receipt of the Required Shareholder Approvals, if (A) the
Company Board makes or publicly proposes to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or (B) there shall have occurred any material Willful Breach of Section

(i) if Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its
representations or warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or

of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.03(a)_ , together
with any reimbursement of applicable expenses pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_
and _Section 7.03(c)_ , the receipt of the applicable Company Termination Fee

be the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Holdco, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or
any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the

  

  

 

58  

  

  

termination hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Holdco,

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(iii)_ , (ii) the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.01(d)(ii)_ or (iii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)(ii)(B)_
, then the Company shall pay to Parent all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, experts and consultants to Parent and its Affiliates)
incurred by Parent in connection with hedging transactions entered into in
connection with the Transactions by wire transfer of same-day funds within two
(2) business days after such termination, it being understood that in no event
shall the payment of such documented out-of-pocket expenses exceed $5,000,000

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that in no event shall the Company
be required to pay an aggregate amount in excess of the Company Termination
Fee _plus_ the Hedging Expense Cap Amount _plus_ , in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(iii)_ or _Section 7.01(d)(ii)_ , the
Parent Expense Cap Amount, whether or not each such amount may be payable
under the applicable provisions of this Agreement at the same time or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events. Each of the
parties hereto also acknowledges that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay amounts pursuant to both _Section 7.03(b)_ and _Section
7.03(c)_ in respect of the same expenses incurred by the Parent.

  


 

  

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without

Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as applicable fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ , and, in order to
obtain the payment, the other party commences an Action which results in a
judgment against the first party for the payment set forth in this _Section
7.03_ , the first party shall pay the other party for its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) in connection with such Action, together with interest on such amount at

foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent, Holdco or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  


 

  

Section 8.04 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment by any party shall
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this _Section 8.04_ shall be null and void.

  


 

  

Section 8.05 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to
the other parties hereto.

  


 

  

Section 8.06 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
together with the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto, the Company
Disclosure Letter, the

  

  

 

60  

  

  

Parent Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Voting
Agreement, (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto
and their Affiliates, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and (b) except for: (i) if the Effective Time occurs, (A)
the right of the holders of Company Shares to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in accordance with _Section 2.01_ and _Section 2.02_ and (B) the right
of the holders of Company Awards as set forth in _Section 2.03_ and _Section
2.04_ , and (ii) the provisions set forth in _Section 5.08_ of this Agreement
are not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall have the right to seek on behalf of the holders
of Company Shares and Company Awards, through an Action brought by the
Company, damages from Parent in the event of a breach of this Agreement by
Parent in respect of amounts that would have been recoverable by such holders
under the circumstances of the applicable breach if all such holders brought
an action against Parent and were recognized as third party beneficiaries
hereunder. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties in
accordance with _Section 8.03_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. Persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  


 

  

Section 8.07 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that state, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of laws principles, except to
the extent the provisions of the laws of Bermuda are mandatorily applicable to
the Merger.

  


 

  

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to the interpretation and
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and in respect of the
Transactions (except to the extent any such proceeding mandatorily must be
brought in Bermuda) shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of
Delaware, or, if both the Delaware Court of Chancery and the federal courts
within the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any other state court within the State of Delaware, and, in each case,
any appellate court therefrom. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such Actions and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack of jurisdiction
to the maintenance of any such Action. The consents to jurisdiction and venue
set forth in this _Section 8.07(b)_ shall not constitute general consents to
service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any
purpose except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer
rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees
that service of process upon such party in any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight
courier at the address set forth in _Section 8.11_ of this Agreement. The
parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Action shall be

  

  

 

61  

  

  

conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to
seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial
court judgment.

  


 

  

Section 8.08 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached,
including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the right of the Company to cause the Merger to be consummated on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement) in the courts
described in _Section 8.07(b)_ without proof of damages or otherwise, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an
adequate remedy at law. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section 8.08_ shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. If, prior to the Walk-Away Date, any party hereto brings any
action, in each case, in accordance with this _Section 8.08_ , to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the Walk-Away Date shall automatically be extended (x) for the period
during which such action is pending, plus ten (10) business days or (y) by
such other time period established by the court presiding over such action, as
the case may be.

  


 

  

Section 8.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

  

  

 

62  

  

  

OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.09_.

  


 

  

Section 8.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a party to this Agreement of
any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

  


 

  

Section 8.11 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, facsimiled (which is confirmed), emailed (which is confirmed) or

Exhibit B

  

  

  

 

FORM OF TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

  


 

  

This Transition Services Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into as
of ___________, by and among White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd., a Bermuda
exempted limited liability company ("White Mountains"), and OneBeacon
Insurance Group, Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability company
("OneBeacon").

  


 

  

RECITALS

  


 

  

A. On May 2, 2017, OneBeacon entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
" _Merger Agreement_ ") with Intact Financial Corporation, a Canadian
corporation ("Parent"), Intact Bermuda Holdings Ltd., a Bermuda exempted
limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Holdco_
"), and Intact Acquisition Co. Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited liability
company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (" _Merger Sub_ "). The
Merger Agreement provides for, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
specified conditions, the merger of Merger Sub with and into OneBeacon (the "
_Merger_ "), with OneBeacon surviving the Merger as a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Holdco and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

  


 

  

As of the effective time of the Merger, OneBeacon will cease to be a
subsidiary of White Mountains and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent.

  


 

  

B. White Mountains and OneBeacon, through their respective subsidiaries, have
provided certain services to each other prior to the date hereof pursuant to
that certain Separation Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2006 (the "
_Separation Agreement_ "), by and between White Mountains and OneBeacon. The
Separation Agreement shall terminate upon the execution of this Agreement.

  


 

  

C. To the extent that other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the
recipient of certain services contemplated to be provided hereunder have not
been made as of the date of this Agreement, White Mountains and OneBeacon have
agreed to continue the provision of such services after the effective time of
the Merger for a limited period of time in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as set forth herein.

  


 

  

AGREEMENT

  


 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and agreements contained
herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, White Mountains and OneBeacon, intending to
be legally bound, agree as follows:

  


 

  

   1. |  

Transition Services

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

1.1 _Basic Services_. To facilitate the continued and uninterrupted operation
of the parties' respective businesses following the effective date of the
Merger (the "Effective Date"):

  

  


 

    

  

  

  

(a) Subject to Article 4, White Mountains shall cause its subsidiaries to
provide, to the extent requested, to OneBeacon those services identified on
Schedule A, as amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement.
Such services are referred to herein as the "White Mountains Services". The
White Mountains Services will be provided in a manner and at a level of
service consistent in all material respects with that provided by the White
Mountains subsidiaries immediately preceding the date of this Agreement under
the terms of the Separation Agreement and, in any event, in a commercially
reasonable manner and at a commercially reasonable service level. To the
extent White Mountains uses subcontractors to provide any requested Services
as of the Effective Date, White Mountains may continue to use such
subcontractors to provide the White Mountains Services to OneBeacon.

  


 

  

(b) Subject to Article 4, OneBeacon shall cause its subsidiaries to provide,
to the extent requested, to White Mountains those services identified on
Schedule B, as amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement.
Such services are referred to herein as the "OneBeacon Services", and,
together with the White Mountains Services, the "Services". The OneBeacon
Services will be provided in a manner and at a level of service consistent in
all material respects with that provided by the OneBeacon subsidiaries
immediately preceding the date of this Agreement under the terms of the
Separation Agreement and, in any event, in a commercially reasonable manner
and at a commercially reasonable service level. To the extent OneBeacon uses
subcontractors to provide any requested Services as of the Effective Date,
OneBeacon may continue to use such subcontractors to provide the OneBeacon
Services to White Mountains.

  


 

  

(c) Any use of subcontractors to provide any requested Services, other than as
provided as of the Effective Date, shall be subject to each party's prior,
written consent.

  


 

  

1.2 _Mutually Agreed Additional Services_. Each party shall provide additional
services that are not set forth on the Schedules which are reasonably
requested by the other party and its subsidiaries, provided that such services
(A) were received by the requesting party in whole or in part from the other
party or its subsidiaries in the ordinary course prior to the Effective Date,
(B) are identified in writing by the requesting party to the other party not
later than two (2) months following the Effective Date and (C) are reasonably
necessary in order to conduct the operations of the requesting party,
_provided_ , _however_ , that such additional services shall be charged out at
the recipient's pro rata share of Cost. If a party requests additional
services, such services shall be set forth on an amendment to Schedule A or
Schedule B, as appropriate, and shall thereafter be "Services" under this
Agreement.

  


 

  

1.3 _Service Fees_. In consideration of the Services provided by each party to
the other during the term of this Agreement, each party receiving Services
shall pay to the party providing the Services the fees applicable to such
Services, computed as provided in the second columns of Schedule A and
Schedule B, as applicable ("Service Fees"). For

  


 

  

 

2  

  

  

  

any partial billing interval of Services which are charged on a periodic
basis, the party charged shall pay a pro rata amount of the applicable Service
Fees, based on the total number of days in such billing interval.

  

  

As used in the Agreement and in the Schedules hereto, a party's "Cost" for
providing a service means all direct costs incurred in rendering the services,
providing resources or providing the use of facilities, including all costs of
personnel travel and all expenses paid to third-parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no allocation of overhead expenses shall be included in
"Cost". Unless otherwise indicated on Schedule A or Schedule B, allocations of
Cost will be based on time utilized.

  


 

  

Each party receiving Services shall pay any and all sales, goods or services,
excise, privilege, value added, lease, use, transfer, consumption or similar
gross receipts based taxes on the sale of Services provided by the other
party, and any and all taxes otherwise imposed on, sustained or incurred with
respect to, or applicable to, the Services provided by such other party.

  


 

  

Each party shall pay and be responsible for its own personal property taxes
and taxes based on its own income, profits or assets. Payments for Services or
other amounts under this Agreement shall be made net of withholding taxes.
Each party shall provide to the other any certifications or other documents
reasonably request by the other party to reduce or eliminate any withholding
of tax.

  


 

  

1.4 _No Extraordinary Capital Expenditures_. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, neither party shall be required to incur any extraordinary
capital expenses in providing Services to the other party.

  


 

  

1.5 _No Representation or Warranty_. Nothing herein shall be construed as a
representation or warranty by any party that all or any portion of the
Services provided by it will be suitable or adequate for the other party's
operations or business.

  


 

  

1.6 _Currency_. All financial obligations originating from the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall be denominated in U.S. dollars.

  


 

  

1.7 _Services Not Permitted by Applicable Law_. Nothing herein should be
construed as requiring any party to provide to the other party any services
not permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
ceasing or modifying any of the Services on the grounds set forth in this
Section 1.7, the party providing the Services shall notify the other party in
writing and the parties shall work in good faith to develop a workaround that
enables the continued provision of the Services in accordance with applicable
law.

  


 

  

1.8 _Third Party Consents_. If a party's provision of any Service requires any
license or services provided by a third party of a Service included in the
then-current White Mountains Services or OneBeacon Services, as applicable,
and such party's contract with the applicable third party for the Service does
not permit such third party's

  

  

 

3  

  

  

  

license or service to be provided by or passed through such party (as a non-
affiliate service provider) to the other party, then the providing party will
use commercially reasonable efforts to secure the consent of such third party
to provide the receiving party with access to such third party license or
Service, as applicable, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. If a party is unable to secure the consent of the applicable third
party vendor using its commercially reasonable efforts, then, notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, that party shall have no
obligation to provide the impacted Service(s) to the other party. The parties
shall each bear one half of any consent fees charged by such third parties.

  

  

    

2.

  |  

Access

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

2.1 During the term of this Agreement, each party shall on a timely basis make
available to the other party and its subsidiaries all information and
materials reasonably requested by such party to enable them to provide the
Services hereunder.

  


 

  

2.2 Upon reasonable notice, each party shall give the other party and its
subsidiaries reasonable access to its premises during normal business hours
and at such other times as are reasonably required for the purpose of
providing the Services hereunder.

  


 

  

2.3 Until the later of (i) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article 4 hereunder, or (ii) the date upon which White Mountains has filed all
necessary reports or filings with any applicable governmental or regulatory
body as required by applicable law relating to the treatment of OneBeacon as a
"discontinued operation" as such term is defined under Accounting Standards
Update No. 2014-08 issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board:

  


 

  

(a) OneBeacon shall provide White Mountains and its representatives with
reasonable access to OneBeacon's books and records, and its finance and
accounting personnel, for such reporting purposes, and

  


 

  

(b) as requested, OneBeacon shall provide on a timely basis such of its
financial books and records and financial statements, prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("US
GAAP"), to White Mountains as are required for White Mountains to satisfy its
public financial statement filing requirements.

  


 

  

2.4 During the term of this Agreement, each party will permit the other party
to access its software and information technology systems, applications and
platforms reasonably required by such party for use in connection with the
performance of Services (" _Host Systems_ "), in each case for the sole
purpose of receiving the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions
expressly stated in this Agreement. Neither party shall have any other
obligation to provide the other party with any other access to or use of its
information technology systems, information technology, platforms, networks,

  

  

  


 

  

 

4  

  

  

  

applications, software databases or computer hardware, except as otherwise
expressly required by this Agreement.

  

  

(a) In no case shall any party introduce or otherwise expose the other party's
Host System to (a) computer code or instructions (e.g., malicious code or
viruses) that may disrupt, damage, or interfere with the Host System or other
software or firmware stored or operated thereon, (b) any device that is
capable of automatically or remotely stopping any Host System from operating,
in whole or in part (e.g., passwords, fuses or time bombs), (c) "back doors"
or "trap doors" which allow for any access or bypassing of any security
feature of the Host System, or (d) any barriers designed for, or having the
effect of, preventing Service Provider from accessing all or any portion of
its systems, software or data.

  


 

  

(b) The party receiving the relevant Services shall, at its sole expense (i)
provide all network connectivity necessary for each of its representatives to
connect to the Host Systems and (ii) comply, and cause each of its
representatives to comply, with all information security policies and
procedures of the party providing the relevant Services in connection with
their access to the Host Systems and receipt and use of the Services.

  


 

  

   3. |  

Billing/Payment

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

3.1 _Payments_.

  


 

  

(a) On or before the thirtieth (30th) day after the end of each calendar
quarter during the term of this Agreement or, if this Agreement terminates
prior to the end of a calendar quarter, the immediately succeeding calendar
quarter end, each party shall prepare and deliver to the other party's
Representative, an invoice describing in reasonable itemized detail the
Services provided and the Service Fees incurred during such quarter.

  


 

  

(b) Each such invoice delivered pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall be payable
within fourteen (14) days after receipt thereof (the "Payment Date").

  


 

  

3.2 _Late Payment_. Payments not made in full by the Payment Date shall bear
interest until payment at a per annum rate of interest equal to the "prime
rate" for the relevant period(s) as shown in the Wall Street Journal on the
date such payment was due.

  


 

  

3.3 _Return of Advance Payments_.

  


 

  

(a) If any Service Fees are paid in advance, and the related Services are
terminated prior to the end of the period for which early payment was made, an
amount equal to the unused portion of the Service Fees (determined on a pro
rata basis based on days in the period for which the Service was active), plus
interest on such amount at the prime rate from the date the Service was
terminated to the date of return,

  

  

  


 

  

 

5  

  

  

  

shall be returned to the early-paying party in the next billing cycle (or
credited against current Service Fees owed) or, if earlier, upon termination
of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) If any payments are made in advance, directly or indirectly, in connection
with any arrangements or agreements relating to the receipt of services by
both OneBeacon and White Mountains, and the related services are terminated
prior to the end of the period for which such pre-payment was made, any refund
or rebate due to the parties shall be allocated between the parties on a pro
rata basis based on the amount of payment made, directly or indirectly, in
advance in respect of such services by OneBeacon and White Mountains,
respectively; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the cessation of such services
to one party is the sole reason for any portion of such refund or rebate, such
portion shall be granted solely to such party to the extent such party has,
directly or indirectly, paid in advance for such services. All payments
allocated pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be made within 14 days of
receipt thereof.

  


 

  

   4. |  

Term of Agreement

   
---|--- 
  

  


 

  

4.1 This Agreement, commencing on the date hereof, shall continue until the
later to occur of (i) the termination of all Services to be provided hereunder
according to Section 4.2 below and (ii) [●]1.

  


 

  

4.2 The obligation of a party to provide any particular service shall
terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the time period for expiration set
forth in such Service's individual description on Schedule A or Schedule B, as
applicable, (ii) the mutual agreement to terminate such Service by the parties
and (iii) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.1 above.

  


 

  

4.3 If a party fails to pay any Service Fees within sixty (60) days following
receipt of notice of non-payment, the noticing party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement while such amounts remain unpaid, except with respect

9  

  

  

  

Neither this Agreement nor any rights or obligations under it are assignable
except; provided, however, that a party may delegate its duties and
obligations under this Agreement to any of its subsidiaries or, consistent
with past practices, to a third-party service provider; provided, however,
that such delegation shall not relieve a party of its duties or obligations
hereunder. Any reference to a party shall include any such person to which
that party has assigned its rights or delegated its duties or obligations

10.5 _Governing Law_.

  


 

  

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the choice of law
principles thereof.

  


 

  

10.6 _Counterparts_.

  


 

  

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

  


 

  

10.7 _Interpretation_.

  


 

  

The article and section headings contained in this Agreement are solely for

shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
The parties are sophisticated, represented by counsel and jointly have
participated in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and there shall
be no presumption or burden of proof favoring or disfavoring any party by
virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

  


 

  

10.8 _Entire Agreement; Termination of Separation Agreement_

  


 

  

This Agreement (including the Schedules attached hereto) embodies the entire
agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or between any of
them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Upon execution of
this Agreement, the Separation Agreement shall be deemed terminated in all
respects, except as set forth therein.

  


 

  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall be
construed to extinguish either party's obligation, without duplication of any
other amounts set forth herein, to pay any accrued but unpaid amounts owed
under the Separation Agreement or any other arrangement between the parties
prior to the date hereof.

  

  

10.9 _No Third Party Beneficiary_.

  


 

  

 

10  

  

  

  

This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create any rights or benefits
of any party other than the parties hereto.

  


 

  

10.10 _Severability_.

  


 

  

If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof) or the application
of any such provision (or any portion thereof) to any person or circumstance
shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall
not affect any other provision hereof (or the remaining portion thereof) or
the application of such provision to any other persons or circumstances. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transaction
contemplated hereby is fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

  


 

  

10.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  


 

  

Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal
court within the State of Delaware, or, if the federal courts within the State
of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other
state court within the State of Delaware, and, in each case, any appellate
court therefrom, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of
White Mountains and OneBeacon further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such party's respective
address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action,
suit or proceeding in the State of Delaware with respect to any matters to
which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this Section 10.11. Each of White
Mountains and OneBeacon irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any such court as
provided in this Section 10.11, and hereby and thereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.

  


 

  

10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  


 

  

EACH PARTY HERETO KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS
IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SCHEDULE
HERETO, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING OR STATEMENT (WHETHER
VERBAL OR WRITTEN) RELATING TO THE FOREGOING. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT FOR THE PARTIES HERETO TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

  

  

  

 

11  

  

  

  

10.13 _Independent Contractors_.

  


 

  

The relationship between OneBeacon and White Mountains under this Agreement is
that of independent contractors. This Agreement is not intended to create and
shall not be construed as creating between OneBeacon, or any of its
subsidiaries, and White Mountains, or any of its subsidiaries the relationship
of affiliate, principal and agent, joint venture, partnership, or any other
similar relationship, the existence of which is hereby expressly denied.

  


 

  

10.14 _Confidentiality_.

  


 

  

The parties acknowledge that as a result of the provision of the Services
contemplated hereunder, they may receive nonpublic and/or personal information
regarding customers and employees and information that has been created,
discovered or developed by the other parties or their respective subsidiaries
and/or in which property rights have been assigned or otherwise conveyed to
such other parties or their respective subsidiaries, which information has
commercial value to such other parties or their respective subsidiaries and is
not in the public domain ("Confidential Information"). Confidential
Information will be and will remain the sole property of such other parties
and their respective assigns. Each party hereby agrees that it will use the
same degree of care which it would normally use to protect its own proprietary
information to prevent disclosing to third parties Confidential Information.
Each party will not make any use, and will cause its subsidiaries not to make
any use, of the Confidential Information, except (i) as contemplated or
required by the terms of this Agreement (including the annexes referred to
herein), (ii) to the extent such Confidential Information is requested by a
third party providing Services hereunder and (iii) as required by applicable
law (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) or regulation.

  


 

  

10.15 _Survival_.

FORM OF SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED 
  INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

  


 

  

WHITE MOUNTAINS ADVISORS LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "
_Advisor_ "), having an address at 200 Hubbard Road, Guilford, Connecticut
06437, and OneBeacon Insurance Group, Ltd., an exempted limited liability
company organized under the laws of Bermuda (the " _Client_ "), having an
address at 605 North Highway 169, Plymouth, Minnesota 55441, and each
affiliate company of the Client listed on _Schedule B_ , and each having an
address of 605 North Highway 169, Plymouth, Minnesota 55441, or which
hereinafter becomes a party to this Agreement (each, an " _Affiliated Company_
", and collectively, the " _Affiliated Companies_ "), hereby enter into this
Second Amended and Restated Investment Management Agreement (this "
_Agreement_ "), dated as of [●], 20[●], and hereby amend and restate in its
entirety the Amended and Restated Investment Management Agreement, dated
December 23, 2014. The parties hereby agree that the Advisor shall act as
discretionary advisor with respect to certain assets of the Client and the
Affiliated Companies described below (the " _Investment Account_ ") on the
following terms and conditions:

  


 

  

1. _Investment Account_. The Investment Account shall consist of the cash and securities of the Client and the Affiliated Companies managed by the Advisor pursuant to this Agreement.

  


 

  

2. _Authority_. The Client and each Affiliated Company hereby appoint the Advisor as advisor for the portion of the Investment Account comprised of its investment assets. Except as may be separately agreed in writing among the Advisor, the Client and any Affiliated Company from time to time, the Advisor hereby agrees to direct the investments in the Investment Account in accordance with the investment guidelines agreed upon by the Client, each Affiliated Company and the Advisor from time to time (the " _Standard Guidelines_ "). Any other agreement by the Advisor, and the Client or an Affiliated Company to manage investment assets in a manner deviating from the Standard Guidelines shall be in writing. The board of directors (or other similar governing body) of the Client and each Affiliated Company shall oversee the activities of the Advisor pursuant to this Agreement and shall retain ultimate authority over the Investment Account, in each case, in relation to their respective investment assets and shall monitor services annually for quality assurance. In addition, the Advisor agrees to provide treasury management advisory services specific to the Investment Account (" _Treasury Management Services_ "), as directed by the Client or any Affiliated Company. The Treasury Management Services include, without limitation, (i) executing investment transactions to support short-term treasury cash requirements, (ii) settling inter-company and dividend treasury transactions with cash and securities, (iii) settling quarterly tax liability payments from the Investment Account, (iv) providing preliminary valuation for securities supporting treasury transactions, (v) assisting the Client or any Affiliated Company in evaluating securities lending programs administered by custodians designated by the Client or such Affiliated Company and acceptable to the Advisor, and (vi) collaborating with the Client or any Affiliated Company to provide treasury 

  

    

  

  

transaction support to custodians and accounting servicing providers
designated by the Client or such Affiliated Company and acceptable to the
Advisor.

  


 

  

3. _Advisor 's Discretionary Authority_. Subject to Section 2, the Advisor shall have full discretion and authority as agent and attorney-in-fact for the Client and each Affiliated Company: (a) to make all investment decisions in respect of the Investment Account on behalf of the Client and the Affiliated Companies and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, at the sole risk of the Client and the Affiliated Companies; (b) to buy, sell, exchange, convert, liquidate or otherwise trade in respect of the Investment Account in any stock, bond or other security or investment, including without limitation private investment funds, hedge funds, and other pooled investment vehicles (such private investment funds, hedge funds, and other pooled investment vehicles collectively referred to as " _Funds_ "); (c) to facilitate the subscription for, redemption or transfer of interests in Funds (including but not limited to performing such acts and executing such documents as may be necessary to subscribe or redeem interests in Funds); and (d) in furtherance of the foregoing, to do anything which the Advisor shall deem requisite, appropriate or advisable in connection therewith, including, without limitation, the placing of orders with respect to, and arrangement for, any of the foregoing, and the selection of such brokers, dealers, sub-advisors and others as the Advisor shall determine in its absolute discretion. The Advisor will be responsible for engaging, contracting with, monitoring and terminating sub-advisors; however no sub-advisor shall be given discretionary authority over the Investment Account without the prior approval of the Client, and to the extent affecting the investment assets of any Affiliated Company, such Affiliated Company.

  


 

  

4. _Liability_. In the performance of its services, the Advisor will not be liable for any error in judgment or any acts or failures to act except those resulting from the Advisor's gross negligence, willful misconduct or malfeasance. Nothing herein shall in any way constitute a waiver or limitation of any right of any person under any applicable U.S. federal or state securities laws. The Advisor shall have no responsibility or liability or whatsoever in respect of assets outside the Investment Account.

  


 

  

5. _Custody_. Investment Account assets shall be held in one or more separately identified accounts in the custody of one or more banks, trust companies, brokerage firms or other entities designated by the Client and each Affiliated Company, and acceptable to the Advisor. The Advisor will communicate its investment purchase, sale and delivery instructions directly with the appropriate custodian or other qualified depository. The Client and each Affiliated Company shall be responsible for its respective custodial arrangements and the payment of all related custodial charges and fees, and the Advisor shall have no responsibility or liability with respect to custody arrangements or the acts, omissions or other conduct of the custodians.

  


 

  

6. _Brokerage_. When placing orders for the execution of transactions for the Investment Account, the Advisor may allocate all transactions to such brokers or dealers, for execution on such markets, at such prices and commission rates, as are selected by the Advisor in its sole discretion. In selecting brokers or dealers to execute transactions, the 

  

  

 

2  

  

  

Advisor need not solicit competitive bids and does not have an obligation to
seek the lowest available commission cost. It is not the Advisor's practice to
negotiate "execution only" commission rates, and, in negotiating commission
rates, the Advisor shall take into account the financial stability and
reputation of brokerage firms and brokerage and research services provided by
such brokers. The Client or any Affiliated Company may be deemed to be paying
for research provided or paid for by the broker which is included in the
commission rate although the Client or such Affiliated Company may not, in any
particular instance, be the direct or indirect beneficiary of the research
services provided. Research furnished by brokers may include, but is not
limited to, written information and analyses concerning specific securities,
companies or sectors, market, finance and economic studies and forecasts,
certain financial publications, statistics and pricing services, discussions
with research personnel, and certain software and data bases utilized in the
investment management process. The Client and each Affiliated Company
acknowledge that since commission rates are generally negotiable, selecting
brokers on the basis of considerations which are not limited to applicable
commission rates may at times result in higher transaction costs than would
otherwise be obtainable.

  


 

  

The Advisor is hereby authorized to, and the Client and each Affiliated
Company acknowledges that the Advisor may, aggregate orders on behalf of the
Investment Account with orders on behalf of other clients of the Advisor. In
such event, the allocation of the securities purchased or sold and the
expenses incurred in the transaction shall be made in a manner that the
Advisor considers to be fair and equitable to all of its clients, including
the Client and the Affiliated Companies, and that is consistent with the
allocation policies and procedures adopted and implemented by the Advisor,
copies of which will be made available to clients upon request.

"significant", as those terms are defined in regulations issued by the U.S.
Department of Labor; and

8. _Reports_. The Advisor shall provide the Client and each Affiliated Company with reports on the status of the Investment Account on a monthly basis. The books and records of the Client and the Affiliated Companies shall include those books and records developed or maintained under or related to this Agreement.

(a) The Advisor will be paid a quarterly management fee and Treasury
Management Fee (the " _Management Fee_ ") for its investment advisory services
and Treasury Management Services provided hereunder, determined in accordance
with _Schedule A_ to this Agreement. For purposes of _Schedule A_, the
Management Fee shall be calculated treating the Investment Account as a single
pool. The Management Fee shall be borne by the Client and the Affiliated
Companies pro rata based on their respective Investment Account assets. During
the term of this Agreement, the Management Fee shall be calculated in
compliance with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual and billed
and payable in arrears on a quarterly basis within sixty (60) days after the
last day of each calendar quarter based upon the value of the Investment
Account as of the last day of the said calendar quarter. The Management Fee
shall be pro-rated for any partial quarter. Capital inflows and outflows will
be time-weighted so that the Management Fee will be charged for only the
period of time such assets are actually managed by the Advisor. In the event
that the Management Fee is to be paid by the custodian out of the Investment
Account, the Client and/or the relevant Affiliated Company will provide
written authorization to the custodian.

investment expenses such as commissions, and (v) other expenses reasonably
related to the purchase, sale or transmittal of Investment Account assets,
provided that the Advisor shall be responsible for research fees and expenses.
The Client is prohibited from advancing funds to the Advisor except to pay for
services defined in this Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) Sub-advisory management or performance fees (" _Sub-advisor Fees_ "), if
any, will be borne by the Client and/or the affected Affiliated Companies, as
appropriate, provided that said fees have been approved in advance by the
Client and/or the affected Affiliated Company. No Management Fee shall accrue
on any assets with respect to which Sub-advisor Fees are paid. At the
Advisor's discretion, Sub-advisor Fees may be structured to be paid directly
to the sub-advisor by the Client or Affiliated Companies or be paid by the
Advisor and reimbursed by the Client or Affiliated Companies without any
markup. Any Management Fees incurred in connection with transactions conducted
by the Advisor with regard to interests in Funds will be borne by the Client
or the affected Affiliated Companies.

  


 

  

10. _Confidential Relationship_. All information and advice furnished by any party to another party pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated by the receiving party as confidential and shall not be disclosed to third-parties except as required by law.

  

  

 

5  

  


 

  

11. _Assignment_. This Agreement may not be assigned (within the meaning of the Advisers Act) by any party without the written consent of the other party, and any assignment without such consent shall automatically cause the termination hereof.

14. _Investment by the Advisor for Its Own Account_. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the Advisor or any of its members, managers, officers, employees or affiliates from buying, selling or trading any securities for its or their own account or accounts.
