provide to Buyer written notice of dispute, which sets forth its objections to
the Company's calculation of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (a
"Purchase Price Dispute Notice"). For the avoidance of doubt, Seller may
provide a Purchase Price Dispute Notice on the basis that it has not been
provided with adequate information to understand and evaluate the differences
between the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (and the components thereof),
on the one hand, and Seller's Estimated  \t\t

 \t\t\tPurchase Price Calculation (and components thereof), on the other
hand. Unless Seller delivers a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Buyer on or
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Seller and the other Parties
agree that the Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth
the final Net Financial Position (and the related Net Financial Position
Adjustment, if any), Closing Date Indebtedness, Unpaid Seller Expenses, the
Transaction Tax Benefit Amount, and the Purchase Price, in each case, for all
purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment).
Prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Seller may accept the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations by delivering written notice to that effect to
Buyer, in which case the Purchase Price will be finally determined when such
notice is given. If Seller delivers a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to Buyer
on or prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disputes set forth in the
Purchase Price Dispute Notice in good faith during the 30-day period
commencing on the date Buyer receives the applicable Purchase Price Dispute
Notice from Seller. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Federal
Rules of Evidence Rule 408 shall apply to Buyer and Seller during such 30-day
period of negotiations and any subsequent dispute arising therefrom. To the
extent any of the items in dispute are resolved and agreed to in writing
between Buyer and Seller during such 30-day period of negotiations, such
resolution shall be final and binding on the Parties with respect to the
specific items so resolved. If Seller and Buyer do not agree upon a final
resolution with respect to any disputed items set forth in the Purchase Price
Dispute Notice within such 30-day period, then the remaining items in dispute
shall be submitted promptly by Buyer and Seller to Deloitte LLP, or if
Deloitte LLP declines the engagement, such other independent accounting firm
of national reputation mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the
"Accounting Firm"). Either Buyer or Seller may retain the Accounting Firm
upon the expiration of the Review Period; provided, that the engagement
agreement for the Accounting Firm must specify that the Accounting Firm will
act as a neutral expert and not as a mediator or as a fiduciary to or advocate
of either Seller or Buyer. Further, the Accounting Firm shall limit its
decision to such items as are in dispute and to only those adjustments as are
necessary for the Proposed Closing Date Calculations to comply with the
provisions of this Agreement, shall act as an accounting expert and not as an
arbitrator and shall not make any determination with respect to any Party's
legal rights under this Agreement. Any item not specifically submitted to the
Accounting Firm for evaluation shall be deemed final and binding on the
Parties (as set forth in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the Purchase
Price Dispute Notice or as otherwise resolved in writing by Seller and Buyer).
The Accounting Firm shall be requested to render a written determination of
the applicable dispute(s) (acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator)
within thirty (30) days after referral of the matter to such Accounting Firm,
which determination must be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis therefor and must be based solely on (A) the definitions and
other applicable provisions of this Agreement, (B) a single presentation
(which presentations shall be limited to the remaining items in dispute set
forth in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations and Purchase Price Dispute
Notice) submitted by each of Buyer and  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSeller to the Accounting Firm within fifteen (15) days after the
engagement thereof (which the Accounting Firm shall forward to the other
Party) and (C) one written response submitted to the Accounting Firm within
five (5) Business Days after receipt of each such presentation (which the
Accounting Firm shall forward to the other Party), and not on independent
review. Neither Buyer, Seller nor the Group Companies shall have any ex parte
conversations or meetings with the Accounting Firm without the prior consent
of the other Parties. The terms of appointment and engagement of the
Accounting Firm shall be as reasonably agreed upon between Seller and Buyer,
and any associated engagement fees shall initially be borne 50% by Seller and
50% by Buyer; provided that such fees shall ultimately be borne by Seller and
Buyer in the same proportion as the aggregate amount of the disputed items
that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as determined by the
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of the disputed items submitted to
the Accounting Firm. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other
costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any
dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Party
incurring such cost and expense. The Accounting Firm shall resolve each
disputed item by choosing a value not in excess of, nor less than, the
greatest or lowest value, respectively, set forth in the presentations (and,
if applicable, the responses) delivered to the Accounting Firm pursuant to
this Section 2.4(b)(ii). Such determination of the Accounting Firm shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties absent manifest error. The Proposed
Closing Date Calculations shall be revised as appropriate to reflect the
resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this Section 2.4(b)(ii), and,
as so revised, such Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set
forth the final Net Financial Position (and the related Net Financial Position
Adjustment, if any), Closing Date Indebtedness, Unpaid Seller Expenses, the
Transaction Tax Benefit Amount, and Purchase Price, in each case, for all
purposes hereunder (including the determination of the Actual
Adjustment). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Buyer shall, and shall cause each Group Company to, promptly
make such Group Company's financial records, supporting documents and work
papers and personnel and accountants and other Representatives available to
Seller and its accountants and other Representatives (including the Accounting
Firm) at reasonable times during the review by Seller of, and the resolution
of any objections with respect to, the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) Buyer and Seller agree that the procedures set forth in this
Section 2.4 for resolving disputes with respect to the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; provided, that this provision shall not prohibit either Party from
instituting litigation to enforce any final determination of the Purchase
Price by the Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(ii) in any court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 10.12. The substance of the
Accounting Firm's determination shall not be subject to review or appeal,
absent a showing of manifest error. It is the intent of the Parties to have
any final determination of the Purchase Price by the Accounting Firm proceed
in an expeditious manner; provided, however, that any deadline or time period
contained herein may be extended or modified by the  \t\t

failure of the Accounting Firm to strictly conform to any deadline or time
period contained herein shall not be a basis for seeking to overturn any
determination rendered by the Accounting Firm which otherwise conforms to the
terms of this Section 2.4. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, then promptly
(but within three (3) Business Days) after the date on which the Purchase
Price is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(b), Buyer shall pay, or
shall cause the Company to pay, to Seller an amount equal to such positive
amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then promptly
(but within three (3) Business Days) after the date on which the Purchase
Price is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(b), the Parties shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to deliver to the Company an amount equal to the absolute value of such
negative amount from the Escrow Funds; provided, that if any portion of the
Escrow Funds is unavailable to satisfy any indemnification obligations of the
Indemnifying Parties as a result of being distributed to Buyer pursuant to
this Section 2.4(c)(ii), Seller shall promptly (but in any event within three
(3) Business Days) cause payment to be made to the Escrow Agent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, in any amount equal to such
unavailable portion, which shall be added to the Escrow Funds held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and shall be available for use pursuant to
ARTICLE 9. If the amount payable to Buyer exceeds the then available Escrow
Funds, then Seller shall promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business
Days after the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant
to Section 2.4(b) pay such deficiency to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by Buyer.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Any amounts which become payable pursuant to this Section
2.4(c) will constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all purposes
hereunder, including for U.S. federal (and applicable state, local and
non-U.S.) income Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable
Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.5 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Buyer and the Company shall be permitted to deduct and
withhold from any payments otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any applicable provision of Tax Law;
provided that no such withholding shall apply to any payments to Seller
hereunder unless and except Buyer has provided Seller with at least ten (10)
Business Days' advance notice of Buyer's intent to withhold and Buyer provides
Seller with a reasonable opportunity to minimize or eliminate such
withholding. Any such withheld amounts shall be paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority and to the extent so paid over shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.  \t\t

necessary forms claiming an exemption from withholding, Buyer is not aware of
any requirement to withhold or deduct any amounts at the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t\tArticle 3 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tExcept as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Buyer as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 3.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a
corporation, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to

businesses as presently conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed
to transact business and is in good standing (or the equivalent thereof) in
each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it, or
the nature of the business conducted by it, makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 3.2 Authority. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver each Transaction Document to which
it is a party and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The
execution and delivery of each Transaction Document to which the Company is a
party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.
Each Transaction Document to which the Company is a party has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid, legal and
binding agreement of the Company (assuming that each such Transaction Document
has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the other
parties thereto), enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, except (a) to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) that the
availability of equitable remedies, including specific performance, is subject
to the discretion of the court before which any Action thereof may be
brought. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 3.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violations.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.3(a), assuming the truth and
accuracy of the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth in Section
5.3, no notice to, filing with, or authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity is necessary for the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) compliance with and filings
under the HSR Act, (ii) those the failure of which to obtain or make would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) those that may be required
solely by reason of Buyer's (as opposed to any other third party's)
participation in the transactions contemplated hereby.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.3(b), neither the execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of any Transaction Document to which
it is a party nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated thereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provision of the Company's Governing Documents, (ii) result in a violation or
breach of, or cause acceleration, or constitute (with or without due notice or
lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any Material Contract, Material Permit or Material Lease to which any Group
Company is a party, (iii) violate any Law or Order of any Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over any Group Company or any of their respective material
properties or assets, or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
(other than Permitted Liens) on any asset of any Group Company, which in the
case of any of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, would have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 3.4 Capitalization.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Company is authorized to issue up to 1,000 shares of common
stock par value $0.01 per share. The Shares comprise all of the Company's
issued and outstanding equity securities. The Shares are held beneficially
and of record by Seller, have been duly authorized and validly issued, and

limited liability company or other business entity, as the case may be,

Laws of its respective jurisdiction of formation, in each case, in all

incorporation or formation, as the case may be, of each Subsidiary of the
Company. Each Subsidiary of the Company has the requisite corporate,
partnership, limited liability company or other applicable power and authority

 \t\t\tbusiness conducted by it, makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(b), no Group Company
directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, at any time, any equity
or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture or other business association or entity. All
outstanding equity securities of each Subsidiary of the Company (except to the

Agreement or any other Transaction Document.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 3.8 Absence of Changes. During the period beginning on the
Latest Balance Sheet Date and ending on the date of this Agreement, (a) there
has not been a Company Material Adverse Effect, (b) the Group Companies have

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 3.9 Compliance with Applicable Law.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Group Companies hold all material permits, licenses,
approvals, certificates and other authorizations of and from all, and have
made all declarations and filings with, Governmental Entities necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses in all material respects as

full force and effect and will continue to be so upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and each Group Company is in compliance with
the terms of the Material Permits, in each case, in all material respects. As
of the date of this Agreement, each Group Company is, and in the twelve (12)
month period ending on the date hereof has been, in compliance with all
applicable Laws in all material respects. No Group Company has as of the date
of this Agreement (i) received any written notice from any Governmental Entity
regarding any material violation by any Group Company of any applicable Law or
(ii) filed with or otherwise provided to any Governmental Entity any written
notice regarding any material violation by any Group Company of any applicable

Employees perform their functions, and (C) to the Company's Knowledge, no
Group Company supports any services to any client, customer or Worksite

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Each Group Company has implemented and maintains in effect
policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance by such Group
Company and each  \t\t

 \t\t\tof their respective directors, officers, employees and agents with
Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions, and each Group Company and
their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, are in compliance
with Anti-Corruption Laws and applicable Sanctions in all material respects.
None of the Group Companies or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, or agents is a Sanctioned Person. This Agreement and the

applicable Sanctions.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 3.10 Properties. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) None of the Group Companies owns or has owned in the last three
(3) years a fee interest in any real property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Schedule 3.10(b) sets forth a true, accurate and complete list
of all leases, subleases, licenses, and guaranties of real property pursuant
to which any Group Company is a tenant as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Material Leases"), which list shall specify for each Material Lease the
following: the parties, including any guarantors, address, monthly base rental
amount and expiration date. Each Material Lease is valid and binding on the
applicable Group Company party thereto, in full force and effect, all rent and
other sums and charges due and payable by the applicable Group Company have
been paid and enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to proper
authorization and execution of such Material Lease by the other parties
thereto), except (i) to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and (ii) that the availability of equitable remedies, including
specific performance, is subject to the discretion of the court before which
any Action thereof may be brought. The Group Company party thereto, and, to
the Company's Knowledge, each of the other parties thereto, has performed in
all material respects all material obligations required to be performed by it
under each Material Lease. The Company has delivered or made available to
Buyer true, complete and accurate copies of each of the Material Leases, and
none of such Material Leases have been modified as of the date hereof in any
material respect, except to the extent that such modifications are disclosed
by the copies delivered or made available to Buyer. To the Company's
Knowledge, no Group Company is in default in any material respect under any of
the Material Leases. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Group Companies have good and valid title to, or otherwise
have the right to use pursuant to a valid and enforceable lease or similar
contractual arrangement, all of their respective tangible and intangible
assets except for inventory sold in the ordinary course of business and not in
violation of this Agreement, in each case, free and clear of any Liens, other
than Permitted Liens, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(d), to the Company's
Knowledge: (i) there are no defects in any of the buildings leased by the
Group Companies under the Material Leases that would materially impair the use
of that property as currently used; and (ii) the premises, structures and
buildings leased by the Group Companies under the Material Leases comply in
all material respects with the legal requirements for their \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t\toperation as currently operated. There are no Actions pending or, to
the Company's Knowledge, threatened by any Governmental Entity that could
materially affect the continued operation of the locations identified in the
Material Leases as currently used. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(e), the Company has not
received written notice of any pending or threatened appropriation or
condemnation materially affecting and impairing the current use of any of the
locations identified in the Material Leases.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 3.11 Tax Matters. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.11: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) All income and other material Tax Returns required to be filed
by, or with respect to, any of the Group Companies have been timely filed
(taking into account extensions), and all such Tax Returns are true, correct
and complete in all material respects. The Company has disclosed on its
federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to
a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of
Section 6662 of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) All Taxes which are due and payable by any of the Group
Companies have been timely paid. Any charges, accruals or reserves for Taxes
provided for in the face of the Financial Statements are adequate, in
accordance with GAAP, to cover such Taxes of the Group Companies for periods
ending on or prior to the date of such Financial Statements, and all such

reasonably give rise to any claim (other than a routine claim for benefits),
or other Action against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA
Affiliates with respect to any Company Benefit Plan. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to
ERISA, no Person holds (or has ever held) any fiduciary office who would be
prohibited from doing so under Section 411 of ERISA and there has not occurred
any (i) non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section
4795 of the Code) or transaction prohibited by Section 406 or 407 of ERISA, or

Affiliate.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) Timely payment has been made of all amounts that the Company
and each ERISA Affiliate is required to pay as contributions to the Company
Benefit Plans as of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of each such

otherwise adequately reserved in accordance with GAAP in the financial
statements of the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable; all premiums and
other payments or contributions that are required to be paid to each Company
Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date have been timely paid; and all monies

with all applicable requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act of 2010, as amended, and all regulations thereunder (together, the "ACA"),
as well as any similar provisions of state or local Law, including all
requirements relating to eligibility waiting periods and the offer of or
provision of minimum essential coverage that is compliant with Section
36B(c)(2)(C) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder to full-time
employees as defined in Section 4980H(c)(4) of the Code and the regulations
issued thereunder. No material excise tax or penalty under the ACA, including
Sections 4980D and 4980H of the Code, is outstanding, has accrued, has arisen
or could reasonably be expected to arise with respect to any period prior to
the Closing, with respect to the Company, any ERISA Affiliate or any Company
Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any unsatisfied
obligations to any employees or qualified beneficiaries pursuant to the ACA,
or any state or local Law governing health care coverage or benefits, that
would result in any liability to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate. The
Company and each Subsidiary and ERISA Affiliate has maintained all records
necessary to demonstrate compliance with the ACA and any other similar state
or local Law, and has timely and properly completed required ACA reporting
under Sections 6055 and 6056 of the Code. \t\t

payable under any Company Benefit Plan being classified as an excess parachute
payment under Section 280G of the Code, as determined without regard to any

accordance with its terms, upon reasonable notice, and subject to restrictions
contained in any confidentiality agreement to which any Group Company is
subject, each Group Company shall provide to Buyer and its authorized
Representatives during normal business hours reasonable access to all books
and records of the Group Companies (in a manner so as to not interfere with
the normal business operations of any Group Company); provided, that the Group
Companies and their respective Representatives shall have no obligation to
provide Buyer and its Representatives access to any books or records to the
extent such books and records do not pertain to the business of any Group
Company and, to such extent, any Group Company and its Representatives are
required under applicable Law to withhold access to or redact any portion of
such books and records. All of such information shall be treated as
confidential information pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the provisions of which are by this reference hereby incorporated
herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
during the period from the date hereof until the Closing, neither Seller nor
any of its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) shall be required to
disclose to Buyer or any of its Representatives any (a) information (i) if
doing so would violate any Contract or Law to which Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including the Group Companies) is a party or is subject or which
it reasonably determined upon the advice of counsel could result in the loss
of the ability to successfully assert attorney-client and/or work product
privileges, (ii) if Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation and such information is reasonably pertinent thereto, or (iii) if
Seller reasonably determines upon the advice of counsel that such information
should not be so disclosed due to its competitively sensitive nature, or (b)
information relating to Taxes or Tax Returns other than information relating
to the Group Companies. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.3 Efforts to Consummate.  \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) In furtherance of the provisions set forth in Section 6.3(a)
and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party hereto
shall make an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, but in
any event within five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement and
each such filing shall include a request for early termination or acceleration
of any applicable waiting or review period under the HSR Act. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section 6.3(e), the parties
shall cooperate with one another and use (and shall cause their respective
affiliates and subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts
to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practical, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing promptly and
fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents (including, any required filings under the HSR Act), (ii) resolve
any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the transactions contemplated and (iii) make all filings, notices and
registrations and obtain all approvals, consents, registrations,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Entity or other
Person. Each Party shall not withdraw the HSR Filing unless all Parties
otherwise agree in writing. Each Party shall supply as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional
information and documentary material that may be reasonably requested pursuant
to the HSR Act. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Each of Buyer and Seller will promptly notify the other of any
written communication made to or received by either Buyer and/or Seller, as
the case may be, from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and, subject to applicable Law, if
practicable, permit the other to review in advance any proposed written
communication to any such Governmental Entity and incorporate the other's
reasonable comments, not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any such Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults
with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other the opportunity to attend, and furnish the other with
copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications between it
and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives on one hand and any
such Governmental Entity or its respective staff on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall
any Party or its Affiliates be required to (i) disclose any information that
in the reasonable judgment of such Party or any of its Affiliates (as the case
may be) would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties
or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality, (ii)
disclose any privileged, confidential or competitive information of such Party
or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) disclose the valuation of, or any
communications, analyses or other work product regarding the valuation of the

same to the outside legal counsel of the other Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate in
obtaining any other consents and approvals that may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any consents
or approvals set forth on Schedule 3.3(a). Without limiting the foregoing,
Seller and the Group Companies shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the license consents and approvals and to enter into the consents
and agreements set forth on Schedule 6.3(d). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein shall obligate or be construed to
obligate Buyer, Buyer's Affiliates, Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates
(including the Company and the Group Companies) to (i) make, or to cause to be
made, any payment to any third party, (ii) commence any Action or (iii) offer
to grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party, in
each case in order to obtain the consent or approval (or to have the
referenced party enter into the new applicable agreement) of such third party
under any Material Contract or Material Lease; provided, however, the filing
fees incurred in connection with the HSR Act shall be borne by Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyer shall in no event be obligated to (i) sell, license or otherwise dispose
of, or to hold separate and agree to sell, license or otherwise dispose of,
any entities, assets or facilities of the Group Companies or Buyer and its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing Date, the Group Companies), (ii)
terminate, amend or assign existing relationships and contractual rights and
obligations of the Group Companies or of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or
(iii) amend, assign or terminate existing licenses or other agreements of the
Group Companies or of Buyer or any of its Affiliates and enter into such new
licenses or other agreements, except in the case of any of the actions or
events set forth in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), the taking of
any such actions or the occurrence of any such events or conditions
(individually or in the aggregate) that would not be or would not reasonably
be expected to be material to the business, results of operations or financial
condition of the Company, the professional employer organization business of
Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as determined in
Buyer's reasonable discretion exercised in good faith. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall in no event be
obligated to litigate (or defend) against any Action (including any Action
seeking a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction) in which a
Governmental Entity is a party to the Action challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law or otherwise seeking to
prevent its consummation. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
requiring any party to agree to any terms or restrictions as a condition to,
or in connection with, obtaining any approvals, consents, registrations,
permits, authorizations or confirmation from any Governmental Entity or other
person unless such terms or restrictions are conditioned upon the
Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.4 Public Announcements. Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Company and Seller, on the other hand, shall consult with one another and seek
one another's approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) before issuing any press release, or otherwise making any public
statements, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement

announcement which it in good faith believes is necessary or advisable in
connection with any requirement of Law, rule or regulation (including rules of
a stock exchange or self-regulated organization), it being understood and
agreed that each Party shall reasonably cooperate to provide the other Parties
with copies of any such announcement in advance of such issuance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the date hereof Stone Point Capital LLC,
Kelso and Company, L.P. and their respective Affiliates are and shall be
permitted to (in good faith coordination with the overall transaction
communication plan by the Parties) (a) report and disclose the status of the
transactions contemplated hereby to each of their direct and indirect, and
potential direct and indirect, limited partners of investment funds managed or
sponsored by such Persons and (b) disclose the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on their websites and otherwise in
the ordinary course of its business.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.5 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers'
Insurance. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Buyer and the Company each agree that all rights to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses now existing in favor
of the directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries, trustees and agents of
each Group Company, as provided in the Group Companies' Governing Documents,
by Contract or as otherwise in effect as of the date hereof with respect to
any matters occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, shall survive the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall continue in full force
and effect and that Buyer shall cause the Group Companies (on their own or on
Seller's behalf) to perform and discharge the Group Companies' obligations to
provide such indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such indemnification shall be
mandatory rather than permissive, and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to
advance expenses in connection with such indemnification as provided in the
applicable Group Company's Governing Documents or other applicable agreements.
The indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation or advancement of
expenses provisions of the Group Companies' Governing Documents shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing Date in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, as of
the Closing Date or at any time prior to the Closing Date, were directors,
officers, employees, fiduciaries, trustees or agents of Seller or any Group
Company, unless such modification is required by applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Group Companies shall purchase, at or prior to the Closing,
at Buyer's cost and expense, a "tail" policy providing employees',
fiduciaries', trustees', directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage
for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date for the benefit of those
Persons who are covered by any Group Company's employees', fiduciaries',
trustees', directors' and officers' liability insurance policies as of the
date hereof or at the Closing, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Closing. Such a policy shall provide coverage that is at least equal to the
coverage provided under Seller's or the Group Companies' current employees',
fiduciaries', trustees', directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies; provided that the Group Companies may substitute therefor policies
of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no
less advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof so long as such substitution
does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Closing Date.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Buyer agrees, and will cause the Group Companies, not to take
any action that would have the effect of limiting the aggregate amount of
insurance coverage required to be maintained for the individuals referred to
in this Section 6.5. If Buyer, any Group Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall merge or consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the surviving or continuing
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of their respective properties and assets as an
entity in one or a series of related transactions to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then in each such case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the successors or assigns of Buyer or such Group Company shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5; provided that
neither Buyer nor such Group Company shall be relieved from such obligation.
In addition, neither Buyer nor any Group Company shall distribute, sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to render Buyer or such Group Company unable to satisfy
its obligations under this Section 6.5. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Each of the directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries,
trustees and agents of Seller and each Group Company (and his or her heirs or
Representatives) entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation,
advancement of expenses, exculpation and insurance set forth in this Section
6.5 are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.5.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.6 Exclusive Dealing.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the Group Companies shall not take, nor shall it permit any of
its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, Representatives, consultants,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to: (i) solicit,
initiate discussions or engage in negotiations with any Person (whether such
negotiations are initiated by any of the Group Companies, an Affiliate, a
third party or otherwise), other than Buyer or its Affiliates, relating to the
possible acquisition of any material portion of the equity or assets of Seller
or any of the Group Companies (whether by way of merger, purchase of equity,
purchase of assets, loan or otherwise) or a material refinancing or
recapitalization of the Group Companies (an "Acquisition Transaction"); (ii)
provide non-public information or documentation with respect to the Group
Companies to any Person, other than Buyer or its Affiliates or its or their
Representatives, relating to an Acquisition Transaction; or (iii) enter into
any definitive agreement with any Person, other than Buyer or its Affiliates,
effecting an Acquisition Transaction.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) In addition to the other obligations under this Section 6.6,
Seller shall promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after
receipt thereof by Seller or its Representatives) advise Buyer orally or in
writing of the existence of any proposed Acquisition Transaction, any request
for information with respect to any Acquisition Transaction, or any inquiry
with respect to or which could reasonably be expected to result in a potential
Acquisition Transaction and the material terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Transaction or inquiry.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance
with this Section 6.6 shall include having such provision specifically
enforced by any court having  \t\t

breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer and that
money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.7 Documents and Information. After the Closing Date,
Buyer and the Company shall, and shall cause the Company's Subsidiaries to,
until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books,
records and other documents pertaining to the business of the Group Companies
in existence on the Closing Date and to make the same available for inspection
and copying by Seller (at Seller's expense) during normal business hours of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable request
and upon reasonable notice. No such books, records or documents shall be
destroyed after the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date by Buyer,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without first advising Seller in
writing and giving Seller a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession
thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.8 Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business
Relations. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.8, during the period from the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Buyer hereby
agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and shall not permit any of
its employees, agents, Representatives or Affiliates to) contact any employee,
client or other material business relation of any Group Company regarding any
Group Company, its business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior consent of the Company, in each case, other than in the
ordinary course of Buyer's and its Subsidiaries' businesses.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.9 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, deed Taxes, conveyance fees, recording fees and other
similar Taxes, fees and charges, together with any interest, penalties or
additions to such Taxes ("Transfer Taxes") that are imposed on any of the
Parties hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%)
by Buyer and the Buyer shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.10 Debt Payoff Letter; Meek and Sinatra Acknowledgment.
The Company shall, and shall cause each other Group Company to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain a customary payoff letter in
respect of the Credit Facilities from the lenders thereto (the "Debt Payoff
Letter") specifying the aggregate amount of the Group Companies' obligations
(including principal, interest, fees, expenses and other amounts payable under
such Closing Date Indebtedness) that will be outstanding as of the Closing
thereunder, (b) obtain a written acknowledgment from Mark Sinatra and Donna
Meek, respectively, specifying their express understanding with respect to the
amounts to be withheld from the equity portion of the earnout payments payable
to them under the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2017, by

Debt Payoff Letter and the Meek/Sinatra Acknowledgments at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tand benefits that could be deemed a "parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) to the extent such "disqualified individual"
has waived his or her right to such payments and benefits, in a manner
reasonably designed to cause the payments and benefits that would otherwise
constitute a "parachute payment" to be exempt from the definition of
"parachute payment" by reason of the exemption provided under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. Prior to delivery to the stockholders and
disqualified individuals of documents in connection with any stockholder
approval contemplated under this paragraph, the Company will provide Buyer or
its counsel (a) its 280G calculations along with the assumptions used to make
the calculations, and (b) a copy of such information to be delivered to the
stockholders and disqualified individuals in connection with the vote. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.12 Representation and Warranty Policy. A Buyer-side
representation and warranty insurance policy underwritten by Euclid

copy of such binder and RandW Insurance Policy as of the date hereof and will
deliver the same to Seller as issued at Closing. The fees, cost and premiums

the RandW Insurance Policy shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty
percent (50%) by Seller (in the form of a Seller Expense). Buyer will
coordinate (and advance as necessary) the payment of all fees, costs and
premiums required when due under the RandW Insurance Policy and will comply in

Policy. Buyer shall take all commercially reasonable actions to cause the RandW
Insurance Policy to be issued and effective at the Closing, with declarations
in the RandW Insurance Policy that are in accordance with the comparable
provisions of the binder to the RandW Insurance Policy provided to Seller. The
RandW Insurance Policy shall include a provision whereby the insurer under the
RandW Insurance Policy expressly waives, and agrees not to pursue, directly or
indirectly, any subrogation rights against Seller or its Affiliates, or any
former or current equityholder(s), managers, members, partners, directors,
officers, employees, agents or Representatives of Seller or its Affiliates
with respect to any claim made by an insured thereunder, subject to customary
carve-outs. Buyer agrees to not seek to make, enter into or consent to, any
amendment to the RandW Insurance Policy following the Closing that would
adversely affect the rights of Seller thereunder (including but not limited to
any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to the waiver of
subrogation provision) without the prior written consent of Seller.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.13 Tax Matters. The provisions of this Section 6.13
shall govern the allocation of responsibility as between Buyer and the Group
Companies, on the one hand, and Seller on the other hand, for certain Tax

Returns for the Group Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are due

the Group Companies, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. With
respect to any such Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall
deliver a draft of any such Tax Return to Seller at least twenty (20) days
prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return in order to provide
Seller with the opportunity to review and comment on such Tax Returns (and
Buyer shall consider in good faith and implement the reasonable comments of
Seller to such Tax Returns, to the extent such  \t\t

 \t\t\tcomments are consistent with the Group Companies' respective past
practices and applicable Law) and consent to the filing of such Tax Returns
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Books and Records; Cooperation. Buyer and the Group Companies,
on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) provide the other Party with such assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, review or filing of
any Tax Return or any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority,
judicial or administrative proceeding, or that could reasonably be expected to
impact Seller or any of its direct or indirect owners. Such assistance shall
include, but not be limited to, promptly forwarding copies of appropriate
notices and forms or other communications received from or sent to any
Governmental Entity which relate to the Group Companies; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) retain and provide the other Party with reasonable access to
all records or information relevant to such Tax Return, audit, examination,
proceeding or claim, including providing copies of all relevant Tax Returns,
together with accompanying schedules and related workpapers, documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by any Governmental Entity and
records concerning the ownership and tax basis of property and make employees
reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Tax Refunds of the Company. Any Tax refunds that are received
by Buyer, the Group Companies, or any of their respective Affiliates, and any
amounts credited against any Tax (and resulting in an actual reduction of the
Taxes owed by Buyer or any Group Company) to which Buyer, the Group Companies,
or any of their respective Affiliates become entitled, that relate to Taxes of
the Group Companies for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, shall be for the account of
Seller, and Buyer shall pay to Seller any such refund (net of Buyer's
additional Taxes and reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining such refund) or
the amount of any such credit no later than ten (10) calendar days after
receipt of such refund or the filing of the Tax Return reporting such credit
(or, if earlier, the date when such a Tax Return should have been timely
filed, including properly obtained extensions). Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Group Companies, and any of their Affiliates to, take all steps reasonably
required to apply for and obtain any Tax refund or credit described in this
Section 6.13(c) relating to the matters set forth on Schedule 6.13(c),
including amending any Tax Return filed, filing or causing to be filed a claim
for a refund of any Taxes paid with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
filing or causing to be filed IRS Form 4466 (and any corresponding state,
local or non-U.S. tax forms, if applicable) (it being understood that if any
such refund or any related interest previously paid to Seller pursuant to this
Section 6.13(c) is required to be repaid to a Governmental Entity or is
subsequently disallowed by a Governmental Entity, Seller shall be required to
repay to Buyer such previously paid amounts). Where permitted, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Group Companies and their respective Affiliates to, claim
any such Tax refund in cash, rather than as a credit against future Tax
liabilities. \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Amendment of Tax Returns. Without the prior written consent of
Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
Buyer will not, and will cause the Group Companies and any of their respective
Affiliates not to, (i) file, refile, or amend any Tax Return relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make or change any election with respect to, or
that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Group
Companies, (iii) agree to waive or extend the statute of limitations relating
to any Taxes of the Group Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv) file
Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in a jurisdiction where the Group
Companies have not historically filed Tax Returns, (v) initiate discussions or
examinations with Taxing Authorities regarding Taxes of the Group Companies
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (vi) make any voluntary disclosures
with respect to Taxes of the Group Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or
(vii) otherwise take any action with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in
each case that could result in Seller (or their direct or indirect owners)
being liable for any amount of Tax or reduce Seller's right to payments
pursuant to this Section 6.13. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Pre-Closing Taxes. To the extent it is necessary for purposes
of this Agreement to determine the allocation of Taxes attributable to a
Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income,
sales, payroll or receipts of the Group Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable
period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Group
Companies hold a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such
time), and the amount of other Taxes of the Group Companies for a Straddle
Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Tax Proceedings.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) If Buyer or any of the Group Companies receives notice of any
audit or other inquiry with respect to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
which would reasonably be expected to affect the Tax liability of Seller or
reduce Seller's rights to payments hereunder, Buyer shall promptly inform
Seller of such notice (which notice shall include copies of any correspondence
received from any Taxing Authority); provided, however, that the failure to
provide such notice with respect to subclause (a) will not affect any right of
Buyer to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that Seller's defense
of a Tax Proceeding is prejudiced by such failure. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) At its election, Seller shall control any Tax Proceeding of
the Group Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Seller Tax Proceeding"), at
Seller's sole expense. Seller shall consult with Buyer regarding any Seller
Tax Proceeding, provide Buyer with information and documents related thereto,
permit Buyer or its Representative to attend any Seller Tax Proceeding, and
not settle any issue therein without the consent of Buyer (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld,  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tconditioned or delayed). In the event that Seller does not elect to
control a Seller Tax Proceeding, Buyer shall consult with Seller regarding any
Seller Tax Proceeding, provide Seller with information and documents related
thereto, permit Seller or its Representative to attend any Seller Tax
Proceeding, and not settle any issue therein without the consent of Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.14 Notice of Developments. Prior to the Closing Date,
Seller may from time to time supplement, modify or update the Disclosure
Schedule to reflect events occurring after the date hereof which, if occurring
prior to the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth or
described on the Disclosure Schedule to avoid a breach in any representation
or warranty set forth in ARTICLE 3 or ARTICLE 4 or would be a breach of any
covenant of Seller or the Company set forth in this Agreement to be performed
prior to the Closing. The delivery by Seller of such supplement, modification
or update shall be ignored for purposes of determining the Buyer Indemnitees'
rights or remedies available hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.15 Financing Cooperation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) During the period from the date hereof until the earlier of the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause each other
Group Company to use its reasonable efforts to, and shall cause its and their
respective attorneys, accountants, financial advisors and other
Representatives to use their commercially reasonable efforts to, provide all
cooperation that is customary in connection with the arrangement of potential
financing for transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement as may
be reasonably requested by Buyer (and all in the context of the financing in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), including (i)
participation in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings among the Person acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchasers of, the financing and senior management and
Representatives of Seller and each Group Company), due diligence sessions,
lender presentations and "road shows" and sessions with rating agencies, (ii)
assisting with the preparation of customary materials for rating agency
presentations, private placement memoranda, marketing materials and
presentations, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents
required in connection with such financing (including public-side versions
thereof) and customary representation letters with respect thereto, (iii)
furnishing Buyer, its Representatives and financing sources with such
pertinent and customary available business and financial information regarding
Seller and each Group Company sufficient to create a customary confidential
information memorandum, including financial statements, (iv) facilitating the
pledging of collateral and perfection of security interests (including
facilitating the receipt of legal opinions (to be obtained by Buyer, its
Affiliates or their Representatives) and obtaining customary payoff letters,
lien releases and instruments of termination or discharge) as required by such
financing providers, including obtaining surveys and title insurance, other
certifications and documents reasonably requested by such financing providers
and cooperating with and assisting Buyer in connection with obtaining such
items as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, (v) executing and delivering
any customary pledge and security documents or other requested certificates or
documents, (vi) using reasonable best efforts to cooperate  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\twith Buyer to satisfy the conditions precedent to any such financing
to the extent within the control of Seller or any Group Company, and (vii)
providing all "know your customer," PATRIOT Act and other available
information required by regulatory authorities under applicable Law; provided,
however, that none of Seller, any Group Company nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other liability in connection with such financing that is not
subject to reimbursement hereunder (other than any commitment fee payable
solely by the Company following the Closing). Any information provided to
Buyer, its Affiliates and their Representatives pursuant to this Section
6.15(a) shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that neither Seller nor any Group Company nor any of their
respective Affiliates nor any of their respective Representatives shall have
any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person under or in
connection with, the arrangement of any such financing that Buyer may raise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is not
subject to reimbursement hereunder (other than any commitment fee payable
solely by the Company following the Closing), in each case, except agreements
with respect thereto that take effect at or in connection with the Closing,
and that Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Group Companies
and their respective Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and
all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
such financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than any such Losses directly resulting from Fraud by Seller with respect to
information provided by Seller). Buyer shall, after the termination of this
Agreement, promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the Group Companies in connection
with cooperation provided for in this Section 6.15(a). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.15, nothing herein will require (A)
any cooperation to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Group Companies or (B) the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, on such Person's behalf, its Representatives) to (x) be
required to take any action that would, or would reasonably be expected to,
conflict with or violate any Laws or any Person's Governing Documents, or
result in the contravention of, or result in a violation of breach of, or
default under, any Material Contract or (y) execute, deliver or perform any
definitive documentation, including any financing agreement, in respect of
such financing, or adopt resolutions or execute consents (other than consents
to the inclusion of financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and any description of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
businesses based on the representations and warranties made by the Company or
Seller in this Agreement in any disclosure document and use of the Company's
and its Subsidiaries logos therein) to approve or authorize the execution,
delivery or performance of the definitive documentation in respect of such
financing prior to the Closing, in each case that is not contingent upon the
Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Seller shall provide Buyer promptly with an electronic version
of their trademarks, service marks and corporate logo of each Group Company
for use in marketing materials for the purpose of syndication of any financing
and hereby consents to the use of the foregoing in connection with any
financing provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or would not reasonably be likely to harm or disparage Seller or
any such Group Company or their marks or the reputation or goodwill of any
Group Company or their marks. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.16 Release.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Seller, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates and
Representatives, hereby releases and forever discharges Buyer, the Company,
and each of their respective past, current and future Affiliates,
Representatives, stockholders, successors and assigns and the respective
Affiliates thereof (individually, a "Releasee"), from any and all claims,
demands, Actions, causes of action, orders, obligations, debts and liabilities
whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at law
and in equity, which Seller, or any of its respective heirs, executors,
administrators or assigns, now has, has ever had, or may hereafter have
against any Releasee solely to the extent arising out of, relating to or in
connection with any event, fact, circumstance or occurrence existing or
occurring on or prior to the Closing, (all of the foregoing collectively
referred to herein as the "Released Claims"); provided, however, that nothing
contained herein shall operate to release any rights or obligations under (and
the Released Claims shall not include) (i) this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, (ii) any indemnification obligations under the Group
Companies' Governing Documents, (iii) any coverage under any applicable
liability insurance policy covering the directors, officers and/or managers of
the Group Companies' Governing Documents in effect on or prior to the Closing
Date, (iv) any rights of Seller to unpaid compensation, employee benefits or
expense reimbursements earned in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to
an employment agreement or any agreement or benefit plan, in each case, as
expressly disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules, or (v) any right or claims
that may arise as a result of an action or event first occurring after the
Closing. Seller represents that it has not made any assignment or transfer of
any Released Claim. Seller hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from,
directly or indirectly, asserting any Released Claim, or commencing,
instituting, or causing to be commenced, any Action of any kind against any
Releasee, based upon any Released Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Seller hereby acknowledges and intends that this release shall
be effective as a bar to each and every one of the Released Claims hereinabove
mentioned or implied. Seller expressly consents that this release shall be
given full force and effect in accordance with each and every express term or
provision, including those relating to any of the Released Claims, including
Released Claims that consist of claims that are unknown and unsuspected by
Seller (notwithstanding any state statute that expressly limits the
effectiveness of a general release of unknown, unsuspected and unanticipated
claims).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Seller understands that it may, as a matter of Law, have the
right not to release existing claims of which it is not aware, unless it
voluntarily chooses to waive this right. Having been so apprised, Seller
nevertheless hereby voluntarily elects to and does waive any and all rights
not to release existing claims that it may have under applicable Law, and
elects to assume all risks for claims that exist, existed or may hereafter
exist in its favor, known or unknown, arising out of or related to liabilities
arising from any claims or other matters purported to be released pursuant to
this Section 6.16. Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that that Buyer is
relying on such waivers and releases in consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without such waivers and releases,
Buyer would not have agreed to the terms of this Agreement. \t\t

such representations and warranties are made on and as of a specified date, in
which case the same shall continue on the Closing Date to be true and correct
as of the specified date and (B) in the cause of clause (iii) above, to the
extent the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and

 \t\t\t(b) Buyer shall have performed and complied in all material
respects with all covenants required to be performed or complied with by it
under this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

either as a basis for not consummating the transactions contemplated hereby or
terminating this Agreement, on the failure of any condition set forth in this

reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tArticle 8

to the Closing: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) by Buyer, if a breach of any representation or warranty or
failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Company or Seller
set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause a condition
set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) not to be satisfied, and such
breach is not cured prior to the earlier of (A) the Business Day prior to the
Outside Date or (B) the date that is thirty (30) days from the date that
Seller is notified in writing by Buyer of such breach or failure to perform;
provided that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if Buyer is then in material breach or
violation of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) by Seller, if a breach of any representation or warranty or
failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in

 \t\t\t(d) by either Buyer or Seller, upon delivery of written notice to
the other Party, if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before
the close of business on February 21, 2019 (the "Outside Date"); provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(d) shall not be available to any Party whose breach of any provision of
this Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such
time; provided further that, if on the Outside Date the condition set forth in
Section 7.1(a) is the only condition in Article 7 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) that shall
not have been satisfied or waived, then upon the written mutual agreement of
Buyer and Seller (to be mutually agreed to by the Parties at least three (3)
calendar days before the Outside Date), the Outside Date may be extended up to
a total of three (3) times, each time by a period of thirty (30) calendar days
(for an aggregate maximum extension of ninety (90) calendar days) (and in the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; provided that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement

 \t\t\tSection 8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated

without liability of any Party (or any of its directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, Affiliates, agents, successors or assigns) to the other Party
except as provided in this Section 8.2, provided that no such termination (nor
any provision of this Agreement) shall relieve any Party from liability for
any damages (including claims for damages based on the consideration that
would have otherwise been payable to Seller) for Fraud or for breach of any
covenant hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of Section 6.4,
this Section 8.2, and ARTICLE 10, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Guarantee shall each remain in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms and each shall (and all rights and remedies thereunder)
survive any termination of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tArticle 9 
SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.1 Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of Seller, the Company and Buyer contained in this Agreement
(including the certificates delivered pursuant hereto) will survive the
Closing but only to the extent specified in this Section 9.1. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) All covenants, obligations and agreements of Seller and Buyer
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and remain in full
force and effect (i) in accordance with its terms; or (ii) if such terms do
not specify an expiration date, such covenant, obligation or other agreement
shall survive until fully performed; provided, that  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tany covenant or agreement to be performed prior to the Closing shall
survive only until the General Survival Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
(including the certificates delivered pursuant hereto) will survive the
Closing until the date that is the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "General Survival Date"); provided, however, that the
Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing until the sixtieth
(60th) day after the applicable statute of limitation; provided, further,
that in the event of Fraud by a Party with respect to any representation or
warranty, such representation or warranty shall survive until the sixtieth
(60th) day after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to the Party committing such Fraud.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 9 on account
of any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties and/or
breach of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement (including
the certificates delivered pursuant hereto) shall terminate when the survival
of the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or agreement expires
pursuant to this Section 9.1, except for pending claims brought prior to such
expiration (which shall terminate upon final resolution of such pending
claim), whether or not a claim has been filed with a Governmental Entity.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.1
shall limit or prohibit the rights of Buyer to pursue recoveries under the RandW
Insurance Policy.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.2 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the limitations
set forth in this ARTICLE 9 (including the provisions of Section 9.1), from

 \t\t\t(a) any breach, misrepresentation of, or inaccuracy of any

Buyer Indemnitees following the Closing, whether or not involving or arising
out of a third party claim, as a result of or relating to:  \t\t

otherwise) shall be the indemnification rights set forth in this ARTICLE 9.

 \t\t\tSection 9.5 Order of Recovery; Limitations on Indemnification
Payments to Buyer Indemnitees. Buyer and Seller agree, for themselves and on
behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) With respect to the indemnification obligations of Seller
pursuant to Section 9.3(a), from and after the Closing, any amounts owing to
any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such obligations (i.e., after the
application of the Indemnity Threshold) shall be payable solely from the
Available Escrow Funds, if any, until the retention under the RandW Insurance
Policy has been satisfied. Subject to Section 9.7, Seller thereafter shall
have no  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tliability, and the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no right to payment
from Seller, for any indemnification obligations of Seller pursuant to Section
9.3(a) and for the avoidance of doubt, Seller's aggregate liability in respect
of Section 9.3(a) shall not exceed $4,500,000.00, except in the case of
Seller's Fraud as contemplated by Section 9.7.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) With respect to the indemnification obligations of Seller
pursuant to Section 9.3(b), Section 9.3(c) (but only with respect to any
breach of the covenants or agreements of the Company or Seller to be performed
prior to or at the Closing the breach of which is addressed by the RandW
Insurance Policy) and Section 9.3(d) (the foregoing indemnification
obligations, the "Policy Covered Indemnification Obligations"), from and after
the Closing, any amounts owing to any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of any
Policy Covered Indemnification Obligation shall be paid as follows: (i)
first, from the Available Escrow Funds, if any, until the retention under the
RandW Insurance Policy has been satisfied; (ii) second, from the RandW Insurance
Policy until coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy has been exhausted; and
(iii) third, from the Available Escrow Funds, if any, until the remaining
Available Escrow Funds are exhausted or have been released, and, subject to
Section 9.7, Seller thereafter shall have no liability, and the Buyer
Indemnitees shall have no right to payment from Seller, for any Policy Covered
Indemnification Obligation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) With respect to the indemnification obligations of Seller
pursuant to Section 9.3(c) (but only with respect to any breach of the
covenants or agreements of the Company or Seller not addressed in Section
9.5(b)), Section 9.3(e) and Section 9.3(h) (the foregoing indemnification
obligation, the "Other Indemnification Obligations"), from and after the
Closing, any amounts owing to any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of any Other
Indemnification Obligation shall be paid solely from the Available Escrow
Funds, if any, until the remaining Available Escrow Funds are exhausted or
have been released, and Seller thereafter shall have no liability, and the
Buyer Indemnitees shall have no right to payment from Seller, for any Other
Indemnification Obligation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) With respect to the indemnification obligations of Seller
pursuant to Section 9.3(f), from and after the Closing, (i) the first
$1,000,000 in Losses owing to any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such matter,
shall be paid solely from the Available Escrow Funds, if any, until the
remaining Available Escrow Funds are exhausted or have been released and (ii)
50% of the next $4,200,000 in Losses (i.e., an aggregate cap in respect of
such matter of $3,100,000) owing to any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such
matter, solely from the Available Escrow Funds, if any, until the Remaining
Available Escrow Funds are exhausted or have been released, and Seller
thereafter shall have no liability, and the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no
right to payment from Seller, in respect of any such matter. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) With respect to the indemnification obligations of Seller
pursuant to Section 9.3(g), from and after the Closing, up to $500,000 in
Losses owing to any Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such matter, shall be paid
solely from the Available Escrow Funds, if any, until the remaining Available
Escrow Funds are exhausted or have been released, and Seller thereafter shall
have no liability, and the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no right to payment
from Seller, in respect of any such matter. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) No Buyer Indemnitee will assert any claims for indemnification
under Section 9.3(a): (i) in respect of any Loss incurred or suffered by such
Buyer Indemnitee that is not a Qualifying Loss and (ii) until such time as the
aggregate of all Qualifying Losses that Buyer Indemnitees may have under
Section 9.3(a) exceeds $4,500,000.00 (the "Indemnity Threshold"), and then
only for the aggregate amount of all Qualifying Losses in excess of the
Indemnity Threshold. Except with respect to Section 2.4(c)(ii) and subject to
Section 9.7, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the aggregate liability of Seller pursuant to this Agreement for any claim or
reason whatsoever shall not exceed an amount equal to the then-remaining
Escrow Funds (the "Available Escrow Funds"), and Buyer, on behalf of itself
and the other Buyer Indemnitees, agrees not to seek, and shall not be entitled
to recover, any Losses or other payments under Section 9.3 from any source
other than the then-remaining Escrow Funds or the RandW Insurance Policy.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) For purposes of this ARTICLE 9, when determining (i) whether
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement exists or has occurred and (ii) the amount of Losses arising in
connection therefrom, the representations and warranties of the parties shall
not be deemed qualified by any reference to "materiality," "material,"
"Material Adverse Effect" or similar phrases that are otherwise set forth
therein (other than in respect of any use of the defined terms "Material
Contract," "Material Permit" or "Material Lease").  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) With respect to each indemnification obligation in this
Agreement: (i) each such obligation shall be calculated on an After-Tax
Basis; (ii) all Losses shall be net of any Eligible Insurance Proceeds (other
than proceeds from the RandW Insurance Policy); (iii) in no event shall an
Indemnifying Party have liability to the Indemnified Party (x) for any
punitive damages, except if and to the extent any such damages are recovered
against an Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third Party Claim or by a
Governmental Entity or (y) with respect to a breach of Section 3.11, for any
Losses with respect to taxable periods or portions thereof beginning after the
Closing Date; and (iv) the Parties shall treat any indemnification payment
made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent
permitted under applicable Tax Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Any Indemnified Party shall take all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate any Losses incurred by such Party upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to any indemnification rights hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying
Party may be covered, in whole or in part, by third party insurance coverage
(other than the RandW Insurance Policy), the Indemnified Party shall promptly
give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (a "Notice of Insurance"). If
the Indemnifying Party so requests within one hundred eighty (180) days after
receipt of a Notice of Insurance, the Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to collect the maximum amount of insurance
proceeds thereunder as they would if such Losses were not subject to
indemnification hereunder, in which event all such proceeds actually received,
net of costs reasonably incurred by the Indemnified Party in seeking such
collection, shall be considered "Eligible  \t\t

 \t\t\tInsurance Proceeds". Any amount payable by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this ARTICLE 9 shall be paid promptly and payment shall not be
delayed pending any determination of Eligible Insurance Proceeds. In any case
where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third party any Eligible Insurance
Proceeds and/or any other amount in respect of any Losses for which an
Indemnifying Party has actually reimbursed such Indemnified Party pursuant to
this ARTICLE 9, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the
Indemnifying Party such Eligible Insurance Proceeds and/or the amount so
recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount of expenses incurred by it in
procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified
Party in respect of such claim and (ii) any amount expended by the
Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such
matter. In the event that prior to the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer and/or the Group Companies fail to make (in the aggregate) a one-
time payment (which may be paid in installments) (and not payments in respect
of ongoing compensation) in respect of the matter set forth on Schedule 9.5(j)
that is less than $2,000,000 (with the amount of such shortfall being the
"Lesser Cost Amount"), Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller an amount equal to
the product of (i) .76 and (ii) the Lesser Cost Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) If the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an
Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to Section 9.2 or 9.3 and
the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a
third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying claim asserted
against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its
rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit
the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of
such payment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l) If an inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties
made by the Company or Seller or a breach of any covenants of the Company or
Seller gives rise to an adjustment in the Purchase Price, or otherwise was the
basis for an adjustment to (or was taken into account in calculating) the
amount of Closing Date Indebtedness, the amount of Unpaid Seller Expenses,
and/or the Net Financial Position Adjustment, in each case, as set forth in
the final Purchase Price calculation (as determined pursuant to Section
2.4(b)), then such inaccuracy or breach shall not give rise to an
indemnification obligation hereunder to the extent the Purchase Price, the
amount of Closing Date Indebtedness, the amount of Unpaid Seller Expenses,
and/or the Net Financial Position Adjustment (or any of the components of the
foregoing), in each case, as set forth in the final Purchase Price calculation
(as determined pursuant to Section 2.4(b)), was actually adjusted. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be indemnified or reimbursed for any
Losses more than one time in respect of any one Loss or related group of
Losses, including to the extent that any Buyer Indemnitee has been
economically compensated therefor (i) pursuant to an adjustment to the Net
Financial Position Adjustment (or any component thereof), in the Purchase
Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(b), or (ii) by the
existence of balance sheet reserves or liabilities in respect of such Losses
that were otherwise included as a balance sheet reserve or liability in the
Latest Balance Sheet. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.6 Notification of Claims; Third Party Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this
Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify the party or parties
liable for such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of any
claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this ARTICLE 9,
describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim; provided, however, that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this ARTICLE 9 except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is prejudiced by such failure. The Parties hereto agree that any claims for
indemnification for which notice is not timely delivered in accordance with
this Section 9.6 shall be expressly barred and are hereby waived, provided,
however, that if, prior to such applicable date, a Party hereto shall have
notified any other Party hereto in accordance with the requirements of this
Section 9.6 of a claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE 9 (whether or
not formal legal action shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such
claim shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with this
ARTICLE 9 notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Upon receipt of notice of a claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 9.6 in respect of a pending or
threatened claim or demand by a third party that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement (such claim or demand being a "Third
Party Claim" and including a pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by
a third party against the Indemnified Party), the Indemnifying Party may, by
notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of
the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, assume the defense and
control of such Third Party Claim, with its own counsel and at its own
expense, but shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and
at its own expense (unless the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that a
conflict of interest exists that makes representation by counsel chosen by the
Indemnifying Party inadvisable or that there are additional or different
defenses available to it than those available to the Indemnifying Party, in
either of which cases, the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnified
Party shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnified Party may
take any actions reasonably necessary to defend such Third Party Claim prior
to the time that it receives notice from the Indemnifying Party as
contemplated by the preceding sentence. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to a
settlement, compromise or discharge of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any Third Party Claim, unless such settlement, compromise or discharge
does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission
of any wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
(i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or
judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement, (ii) not
encumber any of the material assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any
restriction or condition that would apply to or materially adversely affect
any Indemnified Party and (iii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement or
other resolution, a complete and unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from any and all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\twith respect to any claim or demand for which it is seeking
indemnification from the Indemnifying Party or admit to any liability with
respect to such claim or demand without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be entitled to undertake, conduct and control the defense of a Third-Party
Claim if (i) such claim involves potential criminal liability; (ii) the
Indemnified Party reasonably determines upon the written advice of outside
counsel that it would be inappropriate for a single counsel to represent all
parties under applicable standards of legal ethics; or (iii) such claim seeks
an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or if
adversely determined against the Indemnified Party would establish a precedent
that materially impairs the Indemnified Party or its business.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ARTICLE 9
(including Sections 9.2 and 9.3), no Indemnifying Party shall have any
liability under this ARTICLE 9 for any Losses arising out of or in connection
with any Third Party Claim that is settled or compromised by an Indemnified
Party without the consent of such Indemnifying Party (subject to the
requirements otherwise provided in this Section 9.6). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives notice of a claim
for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 9.6 that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days following its receipt of
such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE 9. The Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the
validity of any such claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Buyer shall process and manage the Specified Matters in a
manner consistent with Buyer's normal and ordinary course of business for
similar matters with respect to Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates, and in all
events in a commercially reasonable manner; provided, however, that Buyer
shall not initiate any report or notice acknowledging any deficiency or
violation with respect to the Specified Matters to a Governmental Entity (it
being understood that commercially reasonable actions taken by Buyer or its
Affiliates with respect to the Specified Matters in reasonable anticipation of
or response to an audit or investigation by a Governmental Entity will not be
prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Buyer shall solely and exclusively control, defend, manage and
resolve the Specified Matters. Buyer shall reasonably consult with and keep
Seller reasonably informed with respect to communications to be made to or
received from third parties in connection with the Specified Matters, but
Seller will not have the right to consent to or approve the administration,
management, defense or resolution of the Specified Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller shall control the defense of the matters set forth in Section 9.3(h)
without regard to clause (ii) of the last sentence of Section 9.6(b). \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.1 Entire Agreement; Assignment; Amendment. This
Agreement, together with all Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules hereto, as the
same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented or restated in
accordance with the terms hereof, and together with the Confidentiality
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b)
shall not be assigned by any Party (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of Buyer and Seller; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign its rights and interests
hereunder for the purpose of securing any financing of the transactions
contemplated hereby but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any
liability or obligation hereunder. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement
not in accordance with the terms of this Section 10.1 shall be void. This
Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written agreement executed and
delivered by duly authorized officers of Buyer and Seller (on behalf of itself
and the Company). This Agreement may not be modified or amended except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence and any amendment by any Party
or Parties effected in a manner which does not comply with this Article 10

the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No Party, nor its respective
counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes of
construing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this Agreement shall
be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly for or against
any Party and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Person by virtue of its authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.6 Exhibits and Schedules. All Exhibits and Disclosure
Schedules, or documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set
out in full in this Agreement. Any item disclosed in any Disclosure Schedule
with respect to any Section of the Agreement (whether or not expressly
referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement) shall be deemed to have

 \t\t\tdisclosed with respect to every other Section in this Agreement to the
extent the relevance thereof to such other Section of this Agreement is
reasonably apparent on its face. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of
any specific item in any Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that
such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other
items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting
of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described herein
or included in a Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit or Disclosure
Schedule but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning given to
such term in this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.7 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and
permitted assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement;
provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, each present and former
director, officer, employee, fiduciary, trustee or agent of any Group Company
is an express third party beneficiary of Section 6.5 and each Non-Party
Affiliate is an express third party beneficiary of Section 10.16 (provided,
that Seller may amend, modify or waive any provision hereof on behalf of such
individuals without their prior consent). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.8 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing,
Seller may, on behalf of itself and the Company, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Buyer contained herein,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Buyer
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by Buyer
pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance by Buyer with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer may
(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the Company or Seller contained herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the Company and Seller contained herein
or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by the Company or Seller
pursuant hereto, or (iii) waive compliance by the Company and Seller with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
any Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party
to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.9 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of
this Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable Law, but if any term or other provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable
Law, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, the
Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.10 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement
may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to
be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (A) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (B) IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES
IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN
EACH CASE, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY FURTHER AGREES AND CONSENTS
THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY
COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF
THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.12 Jurisdiction and Venue. Each of the Parties (a)
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware) in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard
and determined in any such court and (c) agrees not to bring any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the
Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
Action so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each Party agrees that
service of summons and complaint or any other process that might be served in
any Action may be made on such Party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the Party to be served at the address of the Party and in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this
Section 10.12, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each Party agrees that a final,
non-appealable judgment in any Action so brought shall be conclusive and may
be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.13 Waiver of Claims Against Debt Providers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller (on behalf
of itself and each Group Company) hereby waives any rights or claims against
any debt financing provider in connection with this Agreement or any such debt
financing or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral or written
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Seller
acknowledges and agrees that no debt financing provider shall have any
liability to Seller or any Group Company in connection with this Agreement,
the debt financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.14 Remedies. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any court
specified in Section 10.12, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.15 Waiver of Conflicts. Recognizing that Kramer Levin
Naftalis and Frankel LLP has acted as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates
and the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that Kramer Levin Naftalis and
Frankel LLP intends to act as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates
(which will no longer include the Group Companies) after the Closing, each of
Buyer and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its
Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Kramer
Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP representing Seller and/or its Affiliates after
the Closing based upon such representation relating to or arising out of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transaction (the
"Engagement"). In addition, all Attorney-Client Communications, as defined
herein, shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely
to Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies). Accordingly, the
Group Companies shall not, without Seller's consent, have access to Attorney-
Client Communications, or to the files of Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP
relating to its representation of the Seller and its Affiliates (including the
Group Companies) in the Engagement, whether or not the Closing shall have
occurred, based upon the fact of such representation. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (a) Seller and its
Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to Attorney-Client Communications, and
none of the Group Companies shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that
files of Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP in respect of the Attorney-Client
Communications and the Engagement constitute property of the client, only
Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall hold such
property rights and (c) Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such Attorney-Client Communications or
files to any of the Group Companies by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP and any of the Group
Companies or otherwise related to the Engagement. Buyer further agrees, on its
own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the
Group Companies), that from and after Closing (i) the attorney-client
privilege, all other evidentiary privileges, and the expectation of client
confidence as to all Attorney-Client Communications belong to Seller and will
not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, Company or any of their Subsidiaries, and
(ii) Seller will have the exclusive right to control, assert, or waive the
attorney-client privilege, any other evidentiary privilege, and the
expectation of client confidence with respect to such Attorney-Client
Communications. Accordingly, Buyer will not, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Group Companies) not to, (A)
assert any attorney-client privilege, other evidentiary privilege, or
expectation of client confidence with respect to any Attorney-Client
Communication, except in the event of a post-Closing dispute with a Person
that is not a Seller or a Seller's Affiliate; or (B) take any action which
could cause any Attorney-Client Communication to cease being a confidential
communication or to otherwise lose protection under the attorney-client
privilege or any other evidentiary privilege, including waiving such
protection in any dispute with a Person that is not a Seller or a Seller's
Affiliate. "Attorney-Client Communication'' means any communication occurring
on or prior to Closing between Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP on the one
hand and Company, its Subsidiaries, Seller, or any of their respective
Affiliates on the other hand that in any way relates to or arises out of the
negotiation, documentation and  \t\t

 \t\t\tconsummation of the Transaction. Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP
is an express third party beneficiary of this Section 10.15. For the
avoidance of doubt, Attorney-Client Communications shall not include
communications occurring on or prior to Closing between Kramer Levin Naftalis
and Frankel LLP on the one hand and any of the Group Companies, Seller, or any
of their respective Affiliates on the other hand, that in any way relates to
or arises out of matters other than the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the Transaction.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.16 Non-Recourse. All claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents (including any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or as an
inducement to enter into this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents),
may be made only against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties
hereto and thereto. No Person who is not a named Party to this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents, including any past, present or future
Affiliate of Seller or the Company or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, incorporators, members, managers, partners, equityholders
(including stockholders and optionholders), Affiliates, agents, attorneys or
Representatives ("Non-Party Affiliates"), shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks
to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or affiliates) for
any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or such other Transaction Document (as the case may be) or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or such
other Transaction Document (as the case may be) or the negotiation or
execution hereof or thereof; and each Party hereto waives and releases all
such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party
Affiliates. \t\t
