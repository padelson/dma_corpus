provided in **Section 2.12**). From and after the Effective Time, the
holder(s) of certificates evidencing ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as
otherwise provided for in this Agreement and applicable Nevada Law.

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and

in writing and who has properly asserted or exercised and perfected
dissenters rights for such shares in accordance with NRS 92A.300 through NRS
92A.500,

 



      
 

 



 

inclusive (collectively, the " **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to consideration for Company Capital Stock set
forth in **Section 2.6(a) **or **Section 2.6(b)**, as applicable, and the
holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may
be granted to such holder or holders in NRS 92A.300 through NRS 92A.500. At
the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding,
shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and
except as otherwise provided by Nevada Law, each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the rights

of Dissenting Shares withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) such holders dissenters rights under Section 92A.300 _et seq._ of
the NRS, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of
such event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital
Stock set forth in **Section 2.6(a) **or **Section 2.6(b)**, as applicable,
upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

or appraisal of Company Capital Stock or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

 



 

(e) _Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into

the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **2.7 _Company Options_**.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall send a notice to all
holders of Company Options, which notice shall notify such holders that (i)
all Company Options held by directors of the Company serving as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and consultants to the Company who are no longer
providing services to the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time will vest in full and become exercisable as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " **Accelerated Options** "), (ii) all Vested Company
Options, Accelerated Options and Partially Vested Company Options, with
respect to the Vested Company Option Shares covered thereby, that are not
exercised prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " **Cashed-Out
Options** ") will be canceled and paid the Option Payment in the manner set
forth in **Section 2.9(b) **and (iii) all Unvested Company Options and all
Partially Vested Options, with respect to any Unvested Company Option Shares
covered thereby, shall be assumed by Parent and become exercisable for shares
of Parent common stock following the Closing in accordance with **Section
2.7(c) **below (the " **Assumed Company Options** "). Holders of Vested
Company Options, Accelerated Options and/or Partially Vested Options shall be
permitted to exercise such Company Options for any such Vested Company Option
Shares in advance of the consummation of the Merger, subject to compliance
with all other terms and conditions of the agreements and the Company Option
Plan pursuant to which such Company Option was granted.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Cashed-Out Option shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive (i) (A) the Option Payment _less_ (B) the
applicable portion thereof which will be deposited by Parent with the Escrow
Agent in accordance with **Section 2.8 **and become payable if, when and to
the extent set forth in **ARTICLE VIII** and the Escrow Agreement and (ii) a
portion of the positive Actual

 



      
 

 



 

Adjustment, if any, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
**Section 2.10**. The payment of the Option Payment and the portion of the
positive Actual Adjustment, if any, to each holder of Cashed-Out Options as
described in this **Section 2.7(b) **shall be reduced by any income or
employment tax withholding required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " **Code** ") or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are withheld pursuant to the preceding
sentence and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of such Cashed-Out Option.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, each Assumed Company Option will continue to have
and be subject to the same terms and conditions, including with respect to its
vesting schedule, as were in effect with respect to such Assumed Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such Assumed
Company Option will be converted into to the right to purchase the number of
shares of common stock of Parent determined by multiplying the number of
Unvested Company Option Shares covered by the Assumed Company Option by the
Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share and (ii) the
per share exercise price for such Assumed Company Option will thereafter equal
the amount determined by dividing the per share exercise price of each Assumed
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to effect the measures contemplated by this Section, including
adoption of any resolutions, interpretations, and plan amendments and receipt
of any necessary consents or waivers within a reasonable period of time prior
to the Effective Time. Copies of the relevant form agreements (and any
agreement materially differing from the applicable form) governing all Company
Options have been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof.

 



 

 **2.8 _Portion of Consideration Deposited with the Escrow Agent_**. Pursuant
to **Section 8.2(a) **and **Section 8.2(b) **and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, Parent shall deposit with respect to each holder of Company Common
Stock and/or Cashed-Out Options his, her or its Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Amount and the Representative Reimbursement Amount deducted from any amounts
otherwise payable to such holder in respect of such Company Common Stock
and/or Cashed-Out Options pursuant to **Section 2.6(b**) ** ** or **Section
2.7(b)**. Such Pro Rata Portions of the Escrow Fund and the Representative
Reimbursement Amount shall be distributed to such holders if, when and to the
extent described in **ARTICLE VIII** and subject to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

 



 

 **2.9 _Surrender of Certificates and Other Exchange Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association shall act as the
exchange agent (the " **Exchange Agent** ") in the Merger.

 



 

(b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter
into an agreement with the Exchange Agent (the " **Exchange Agent Agreement**
") which shall provide that, at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this
**ARTICLE II**, cash in the amount necessary to pay to each holder of record
(as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of shares of Company Capital
Stock the applicable consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in
**Section 2.6** and to the holders of Cashed-Out Options that are not
Employees as of the Effective Time, the applicable consideration to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to **Section 2.7**. Any cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent from time to time shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
**Exchange Fund**."

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures for Holders of Company Capital Stock_. Promptly after
the Effective Time, or, to the extent commercially practicable, prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to
each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of
shares of Company Capital Stock whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the applicable consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in
**Section 2.6**: (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificate or
certificates representing such shares of Company Capital Stock (the "
**Certificates** "), as the case may be, shall pass only upon receipt of the
Certificates by the Exchange Agent or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, following delivery of an affidavit, if required in the
manner provided in **Section 2.12**) and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as are reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for cash constituting the applicable consideration for Company
Capital Stock set forth in **Section 2.6**. Upon surrender of Certificates
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by
the Exchange Agent, the holder of record of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash payable by its
terms at the Closing constituting the applicable consideration for Company
Capital Stock set forth in **Section 2.6 **and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. At the election of any holder of
Company Capital Stock who is to receive in excess of $100,000 in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, the Exchange Agent shall make, at
the expense of such holder of Company Capital Stock, any payment of Merger
Consideration to such holder by wire transfer. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for
all purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the applicable
consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth in **Section 2.6**. In
addition, and notwithstanding anything in this **Section 2.9(c) **to the
contrary, each of the Parent and the Company shall use its Reasonable Best
Efforts to cause the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement to provide that if
a Company Securityholder who is to receive in excess of $1,000,000 in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby surrenders to the
Exchange Agent (i) a duly executed letter of transmittal and (ii) the
applicable Certificate(s) held by such holder, at least one business day prior
to the anticipated Closing Date, and such holder continues to be the record
holder of such Company Capital Stock or Company Options, as the case may be,
as of the Closing Date, then such holder shall be entitled to receive, on the
Closing Date, a wire transfer equal to the portion of the Merger Consideration
such holder is entitled to receive at the Closing pursuant to this **ARTICLE
II**. To the extent that the Company continues to hold Certificates as
custodian for the benefit of the holders of the shares represented thereby,
the foregoing procedures shall be appropriately modified such that the
responsibility for delivering the Certificates is allocated to the Company.

 



 

(d) _Payment to Holders of Cashed-Out Options._

 



 

(i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay to each
such holder of a Cashed-Out Option, (x) in connection with the first customary
payroll payment of the Company after the Effective Time in the case of the
Option Payment, cash, in accordance with Parents standard payroll procedures
in an amount equal to the aggregate Option Payment to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to **Section 2.7**, and (y) in connection with the first
customary payroll payment of the Company after the date on which the payment
of any positive Actual Adjustment, portion of the Escrow Fund or portion of
the Representative Reimbursement Amount is to be made to holders of Cashed-Out
Options pursuant to the terms hereof in the case of such other payments, cash,
in accordance with Parents standard payroll procedures in an amount equal to
(A) the portion of the positive Actual Adjustment, if any, to which such
holder is due on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
**Section 2.10**, (B) a portion of the Escrow Fund, if any, to which such
holder is due on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
**ARTICLE VIII** and the Escrow Agreement and (C) a portion of the
Representative Reimbursement Amount,

 



      
 

 



 

if any, to which such holder is due on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in **ARTICLE VIII** and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(ii) Parent, the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon, and shall rely upon, information provided by the Company regarding the
Cashed-Out Options (including, the Spreadsheet), and none of Parent, the
Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent shall require holders of Cashed-Out Options
to surrender any documents related thereto as a condition to receipt thereof.
The Escrow Agent shall disburse any amounts due to former holders of Company
Options from the Escrow Fund or the Representative Reimbursement Fund pursuant
to this Agreement to Parent for further distribution to the holders of Cashed-
Out Options pursuant to the terms of **ARTICLE VIII**.

 



 

(e) _Change to Payees_. If any portion of the consideration payable to Company
Stockholders pursuant to **Section 2.6** is to be paid to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor are
registered, it shall be a condition to the payment of the Merger Consideration
that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be transferable, and shall be
properly assigned, endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, (ii)
such transfer shall otherwise be proper and (iii) the Person requesting such
transfer shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes payable
by reason of the foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid.

 



 

(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Company Capital Stock or holder of Cashed-Out
Options such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under the Code or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
consideration would otherwise have been paid absent such deduction or
withholding.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this **Section
2.9**, none of Parent, the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Capital Stock or
a holder of Cashed-Out Options for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

 



 

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company
Securityholders pursuant to this **ARTICLE II**. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange
Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company
Securityholders pursuant to this **ARTICLE II** shall be paid to Parent.

 



 

(i) _No Interest_. No interest shall accumulate on any consideration payable
in connection with the Merger (except as provided in the Escrow Agreement);
provided, however, that some payments may be treated as imputed interest to
the extent required under the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(j) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
which remains in the Exchange Fund undistributed to the holders of Company
Capital Stock and holders of Cashed-Out Options six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall, at the request of Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
be delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation or otherwise according to
the instruction of

 



       
 

 



 

Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Any holders of Company Capital Stock who
have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this **Section
2.9** and holders of Cashed-Out Options shall, after any such delivery to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent of the then remaining Exchange Fund look only
to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for the amount of cash payable in
respect of such shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to **Section 2.6**
or in respect of such Cashed-Out Options pursuant to **Section 2.7**.

 



 

 **2.10 _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_**.

 



 

(a) _Estimated Merger Consideration_. No later than two (2) business days
prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a good faith
estimate of the Merger Consideration (the " **Estimated Merger Consideration**
"), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, including relevant
backup materials and schedules, in detail reasonably acceptable to Parent,
pursuant to which the Company shall estimate (i) the Aggregate Option Exercise
Amount, (ii) the Company Closing Debt, (iii) the Transaction Expenses, (iv)
the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents, (v) the Net Working Capital
Adjustment, (vi) the Unreimbursed Financing Expenses, (vii) the Vacation
Adjustment and (viii) the Permitted Adjustment and shall include the agreed
upon Escrow Amount and Representative Reimbursement Amount. The Company shall
also attach a statement setting forth the calculations showing the basis for
the determination of such sums. The Estimated Merger Consideration shall be
used to determine all amounts paid to Company Securityholders at the Effective
Time, subject to subsequent adjustment pursuant to **Section 2.10(b) and
(c)**.

 



 

(b) _Determination of Final Merger Consideration_. No later than sixty (60)
calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the
Securityholders Representative a proposed calculation of the Merger
Consideration which shall include calculations of (i) the Aggregate Option
Exercise Amount, (ii) the Company Closing Debt, (iii) the Transaction
Expenses, (iv) the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents, (v) the Net Working
Capital Adjustment, (vi) the Unreimbursed Financing Expenses, (vii) the
Vacation Adjustment (viii) the Permitted Adjustment, taking into consideration
the agreed upon Escrow Amount and Representative Reimbursement Amounts, which
shall remain constant (which calculations shall collectively be referred to
herein as the " **Proposed Closing Date** **Calculations** ").

 



 

(i) If the Securityholders Representative does not give written notice of any
dispute over the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (a " **Merger
Consideration Dispute Notice** ") to Parent within forty-five (45) calendar
days of receiving the Proposed Closing Date Calculations, the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final Aggregate Option
Exercise Amount, Net Working Capital Adjustment, Cash and Cash Equivalents,
Company Closing Debt, Transaction Expenses, Unreimbursed Financing Expenses,
Vacation Adjustment, Permitted Adjustment and Merger Consideration, in each
case, for purposes of determining the Actual Adjustment. Prior to the end of
such forty-five (45) calendar day period, the Securityholders Representative
may also accept the Proposed Closing Date Calculations by delivering written
notice to that effect to Parent, in which case the Merger Consideration will
be finally determined when such notice is given. Any items not included in
such Merger Consideration Dispute Notice shall be deemed to be agreed to in
all respects by the Securityholders Representative, and shall become binding
on the parties. If the Securityholders Representative gives a Merger
Consideration Dispute Notice to Parent within such forty-five (45) calendar
day period, Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall use
Reasonable Best Efforts to resolve the dispute during the thirty (30) calendar
day period commencing on the date Parent receives the Merger Consideration
Dispute Notice from the Securityholders Representative. If the
Securityholders Representative and Parent do not agree upon a final
resolution with respect to any disputed items within such thirty (30) calendar
day period, then the remaining items in dispute shall be submitted immediately
to Ernst and Young, in the first instance, or, to the extent that Ernst and Young
is not able to perform such services for any reason, then to
PricewaterhouseCoopers, or to the extent that PricewaterhouseCoopers is not
able to perform such services for any reason, then to another

 



      
 

 



 

nationally recognized, independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Securityholders Representative (or, if Parent and the
Securityholders Representative cannot agree on such a firm, then such
nationally recognized, independent accounting firm shall be selected in
accordance with the rules of the Wilmington, Delaware office of the American
Arbitration Association) (in any of such cases, the " **Accounting Firm** ").
The Accounting Firm shall be requested to render a determination of the
applicable dispute within forty-five (45) calendar days after referral of the
matter to such Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and
must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The terms of
appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as agreed upon
between the Securityholders Representative and Parent, and any associated
engagement fees shall initially be borne fifty percent (50%) by the
Securityholders Representative (on behalf of the Company Securityholders,
which amounts shall be deducted from the Representative Reimbursement Amount)
and fifty percent (50%) by Parent; provided that such fees shall ultimately be
borne by Parent and the Securityholders Representative on behalf of the
Company Securityholders in inverse proportion as they prevail on matters
resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportional allocations also shall be
determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the
Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matter. Any amounts borne by
the Securityholders Representative shall be Securityholders Representative
Expenses. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs and
expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection with resolving any
dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party
incurring such cost and expense. In resolving the disputed items, the
Accounting Firm shall: (A) limit its review to determining whether the amount
for each item set forth in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations or the
Merger Consideration Dispute Notice is more consistent with the related
definitions of Aggregate Option Exercise Amount, Net Working Capital
Adjustment, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Company Closing Debt, Transaction
Expenses, Unreimbursed Financing Expenses, Vacation Adjustment, Permitted
Adjustment and Merger Consideration set forth in this Agreement, (B) resolve
each such disputed item by choosing such amount that it determines to be more
consistent with the applicable definition, (C) review only such matters that
were properly included in the Merger Consideration Dispute Notice and (D) not
assign a value for any item that remains in dispute that is greater than the
greatest value, or smaller than the smallest value, set forth by either Parent
in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations or the Securityholders
Representative in the Merger Consideration Dispute Notice. Such determination
of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto. The Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be revised as appropriate
to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this **Section
2.10(b)(i) **and, as so revised, such Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall
be deemed to set forth the final Aggregate Option Exercise Price, Net Working
Capital Adjustment, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Company Closing Debt,
Transaction Expenses, Unreimbursed Financing Expenses, Vacation Adjustment,
Permitted Adjustment and Merger Consideration, in each case, for all purposes
hereunder (including the determination of the Actual Adjustment).

 



 

(ii) The Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause the Subsidiary to, make
its financial records reasonably available to the Securityholders
Representative and its accountants and other representatives (by electronic
means to the extent available) at reasonable times during the review by the
Securityholders Representative of, and the resolution of any objections with
respect to, the Proposed Closing Date Calculations.

 



 

(c) _Adjustment to Estimated Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount that is equal to or greater
than $100,000 (the " **Threshold Overage** "), (A) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to the Exchange Agent (for deposit in the Exchange Fund
as an increase to the Exchange Fund) an amount equal to the product of (x)
such positive amount _multiplied_ by (y) the aggregate Pro Rata Portions of
such amount attributable to holders of Company Common Stock, net of applicable
withholding taxes, if any, by wire transfer or delivery of immediately
available funds, in each case, within three (3) business days after the date
on which the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this **Section 2.10**
and (B) the Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the balance of the
Threshold Overage after accounting for the payment made to the Exchange Agent
in **Section 2.10(c)(i)(A) **and deliver it to the holders of Cashed-Out
Options in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions and in the manner
provided for in **Section 2.9(d)**.

 



 

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount that is less than $100,000,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay to the Escrow Agent (for deposit
in the Escrow Fund) an amount equal to such positive amount, net of applicable
withholding taxes, if any, by wire transfer or delivery of immediately
available funds, in each case, within three (3) business days after the date
on which the Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this
**Section 2.10**. Such amount will be distributed to the Escrow Participants
on the Escrow Termination Date pursuant to **Section 8.5** and the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(iii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three (3)
business days after the date on which the Merger Consideration is finally
determined pursuant to this **Section 2.10 **Parent and the Securityholders
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Surviving Corporation an amount
equal to the absolute value of such negative amount.

 



 

 **2.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock or Company
Options_**. All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Capital Stock and the cancellation of Cashed-Out Options and the assumption by
Parent of the Assumed Company Options in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Options, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or paperwork related to Company Options are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this **ARTICLE II**.

 



 

 **2.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_**. In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate shall be exchanged for the consideration set forth in **Section
2.6**; provided, however, that the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Person who is
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to provide an
indemnification agreement in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Exchange Agent against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

 **2.13 _Adjustments_**. The per share amounts of any consideration payable to
Company Securityholders hereunder, and any other applicable numbers or
amounts, shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Capital Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Company Capital Stock occurring or having a record date on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

 **2.14 _Further Action_**. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation are hereby authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the

 



      
 

 



 

rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, on the
date of this Agreement, that except as set forth in the disclosure letter
delivered by the Company to Parent concurrently herewith (the disclosures in
which shall identify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which they
apply but shall also qualify such other sections or subsections of this
Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent (with or without a
specific cross-reference) on its face from a reading of the disclosure items
that such disclosure is applicable to such other section or subsection) (the "
**Company Disclosure Letter** "):

 



 

 **3.1 _Organization; Standing and Power; Charter Documents; Subsidiary_**.

to the extent such status exists), (ii) has the requisite power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted, and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) _Charter Documents_. The Company has delivered or made available to
Parent: (i) a true and correct copy of the Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Company, each as amended to date (collectively, the " **Company
Charter Documents** ") and (ii) the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, or

(collectively, " **Subsidiary Charter Documents** "), and each such instrument

respect.

(c) _Benefit Plan Compliance_. In all material respects, each Company Employee
Plan and Employee Agreement has been established and maintained in accordance
with its terms and in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements,
including but not limited to ERISA or the Code. Any Company Employee Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust

Regulations or IRS pronouncements, or obtained a favorable determination,
notification, advisory and/or opinion letter, as applicable, as to its

under Section 401(a) of the Code, to the Companys Knowledge, there has been
no event, condition or circumstance that has adversely affected or is likely

the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and
not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to
any Company Employee Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in
liability for the Company or the Subsidiary either directly or as indemnitor.
There are no current actions, suits or claims pending, or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated (other than routine claims
for benefits) against any Company Employee Plan or against the assets of any

502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _No Pension or Welfare Plans_. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed
to, any (i) Pension Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code; (ii) Multiemployer Plan; (iii) "multiple employer plan" as
defined in ERISA or the Code; or (iv) a "funded welfare plan" within the

(f) _Terminability_. To the Knowledge of the Company, each Company Employee
Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally and with no further expense by
the Company (other than for benefits accrued through the date of termination
or amendment and reasonable administrative expenses related thereto) and no
Company Employee Plan, Employee Agreement, plan documentation or agreement,
summary plan description or other written communication distributed generally
to employees by its terms prohibits the Company from amending or terminating
any such plans, agreements, or arrangements. To the Knowledge of the Company,
the investment vehicles used to fund the Company Employee Plans may be changed
at any time without incurring a material sales charge, surrender fee or other
similar expense.

 



 

(g) _No Post-Employment Obligations or Tax Obligations_. No Company Employee
Plan or Employee Agreement (i) provides, or reflects or represents any
liability to provide post-termination or retiree welfare benefits to any
person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other similar
Legal Requirements or (ii) promises or provides any tax gross ups or tax
indemnification, whether under Sections 280G or 409A of the Code or otherwise.

 



 

(h) _409A; Loans; Insurance_. Each Company Employee Plan or Employee Agreement
that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated since January 1, 2005 in compliance
with then applicable guidance under Section 409A of the Code and since January
1, 2009 each such plan or agreement has been documented in compliance in all
material respects with then applicable guidance under Section 409A of the
Code. No stock option or stock appreciation right granted by the Company has
an exercise or measurement price that is less than the fair market value of
the underlying stock as of the date such option or right was granted, or has
any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of
recognition of income until the later of exercise or disposition of such
option or right. There are no loans or extensions of credit between the
Company and any their employees or independent contractors (other than
customary advances in connection with ordinary, nontaxable, reimbursable
business expenses). There is no corporate-owned life insurance (COLI), split-
dollar life insurance policy or any other life insurance policy on the life of
any employee of the Company as to which the Company has any obligation,
liability, claim, or asset.

 



 

(i) _Effect of Transaction_. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events such as employment
termination) constitute an event under any Company Employee Plan or Employee
Agreement that will result in any material payment (whether of severance pay
or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting,
distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect
to any individual. No payment or benefit which will be made by the Company or
the

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiary to any "disqualified individual" will be characterized as a
"parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. No
stockholder, employee, officer or director of the Company has been promised or
paid any bonus or incentive compensation related to the transactions
contemplated hereby other than pursuant to promises or payments (including

Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the

in which shall identify the section or subsection of this Agreement to

 



      
 

 



 

which they apply but shall also qualify such other sections or subsections of
this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent (with or without a

that such disclosure is applicable to such other section or subsection) (the "
**Parent Disclosure Letter** "):

properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, and (iii) is
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than
in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to
be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

 **4.2 _Merger Sub_**. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of
1,000 shares of common stock, no par value, 100 of which shares are issued and

Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming due execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in

bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (B)
as the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of

will not: (i) violate the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or the
articles of incorporation or bylaws of Merger Sub or (ii) subject to
compliance with the requirements set forth in **Section 4.3(c)**, violate any
material Legal Requirement applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents
other subsidiaries or by which Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents other
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is bound; or (iii) result
in any material breach of or constitute a material default (or an event that

obligations of

 



      
 

 



 

any Person under, or give to others any rights of termination, material
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of or under any material contract to
which the Company or (iv) except as contemplated by this Agreement or with
respect to Permitted Liens, result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent except, in each case of the foregoing clauses
(ii) and (iii), as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in
the aggregate, material to Parent or the Merger Sub taken as a whole or
adversely affect or materially delay Parents or Merger Subs ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or satisfy their respective
obligations hereunder.

 



 

(c) _Necessary Consents_. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with any Governmental Entity is required
to be obtained or made by Parent in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and other transactions

the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada and appropriate documents with
the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company and/or Parent
are qualified to do business, (ii) such consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required

delay Parents or Merger Subs ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or satisfy their respective obligations hereunder. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, has been threatened, against Parent, Merger Sub or any of
Parents other subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby. There is no material judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding upon Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents
other its subsidiaries which has or would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of adversely affecting or materially delaying Parents or Merger Subs
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or satisfy their
respective obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **4.5 _Litigation_**. As of the date hereof, there are no claims, suits,
actions, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents other subsidiaries,
before any by any Governmental Entity or any arbitrator that seeks to restrain
or enjoin the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or which,
if determined adversely to Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents other
subsidiaries, would reasonably be expected, either singularly or in the
aggregate with all such claims, suits, actions, proceedings or investigations
to adversely affect or materially delay Parents or Merger Subs ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or satisfy their respective
obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **4.6 _Brokers  and Finders Fees; Fees and Expenses_**. Except for fees
payable to Citi or its affiliates pursuant to the letter agreement dated
October 21, 2011, none of the Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents other

liability for brokerage or finders fees or agents commissions or any similar
charges in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



      
 

 



 

 **4.7 _Availability of Funds_**.

 



 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a complete and correct copy of the
fully executed commitment letter from Citi and has made available a redacted
copy of the "flex provisions" of the related fee letter, each dated as of
November 7, 2011 (collectively, the " **Debt Commitment Letter** "), pursuant
to which Citi has committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth therein, to provide the debt financing described therein in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Debt Commitment
Letter has not been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement,
as of the date of this Agreement no such amendment or modification is
contemplated by Parent, and as of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge
of Parent, the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not
been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter
that are payable on or prior to the date hereof, and Parent will pay when due
all other commitment fees and other fees arising under the Debt Commitment
Letter as and when they become due and payable thereunder. As of the date
hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is the
legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, Citi, enforceable against Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, Citi
in accordance with its terms except, in each of the foregoing cases (A) as
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law), and (B) as the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction before
which any proceeding may be brought. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, Citi under the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(b) The consummation of the Debt Financing is subject to no conditions
precedent other than those expressly set forth in the copy of the Debt
Commitment Letter delivered to the Company. As of the date hereof, Parent has
no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will not be satisfied. The
aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing, together with any cash or cash
equivalents held by Parent as of the Effective Time, will be sufficient to
enable Parent to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid in connection
with the Merger.

Vacation balances of employees of the Company is referred to herein as the "
**Vacation Payout**."

all obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or
any similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation (the " **WARN Act** "),
including any notice and/or payment obligations, associated with or related to

Parent, purchase a fully-paid up extension of its current directors and
officers liability insurance (the " **D andO Tail Insurance**") covering the

under the Company directors and officers liability insurance policy, a copy
of which has been made available to Parent (the amount of the premium for such
policy, the " **D andO Tail Insurance Premium**"). The DandO Tail Insurance shall

events or circumstances occurring subsequent to the date hereof of which such
party has Knowledge which would render any representation or warranty in this

representation, warranty or statement in this Agreement or the Company
Disclosure Letter.

reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) such transactions from any applicable Takeover Law, as now or
hereafter in effect and (b) to comply with any Takeover Provisions and will
take all reasonable steps within its control to make such transactions comply
with (or continue to comply with) any Takeover Provisions. If any Takeover Law
or Takeover Provision becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by

Directors of the Company will, upon the written request of Parent or Merger
Sub, use its Reasonable Best Efforts to ensure that such transactions may be

received by such "disqualified individual" shall be a "parachute payment"
under Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined without regard to Section
280G(b)(4) of the Code). Such vote shall establish the disqualified
individuals right to the payment or other compensation and the Company shall
obtain any required waivers or consents from the disqualified individual prior
to the vote. In addition, the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to
Company stockholders that hold voting Company Capital Stock of all material
facts concerning all payments to any such disqualified individual that, but
for such vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the
Code in a manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and
regulations promulgated thereunder. Parent and its counsel shall have the
right to review and comment on all documents required to be delivered to the

disqualified individual waivers or consents and Parent and its counsel shall
be provided copies of all vote documents executed by the stockholders and
disqualified individuals.

**Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3(a) and 3.12(i) **(collectively, the " **Fundamental
Representations** ") as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date as if

delivered by the Company pursuant to **Section 7.3** of this Agreement, (ii)
any breach of any Fundamental Representation as of the date hereof or as of
the Closing Date as if made on the Closing Date (except to the extent that any
such Fundamental Representation was expressly made as of a specific date, in
which case any breach of such Fundamental Representation as of such date),
(iii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant of the
Company contained in this Agreement prior to the Closing Date, (iv) fraud
committed by the Company or the Subsidiary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (v) any breaches by the Securityholders
Representative of the covenants and agreements of the Securityholders

(provided that any Losses with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to this clause (vi) shall be limited to the amounts set forth in
**Section 8.3(a)(vi) **of the Company Disclosure Letter).

 



 

(b) Solely for purposes of calculating Losses that are recoverable pursuant to
this **ARTICLE VIII**, and not for purposes of determining whether a breach
has occurred, all representations and warranties of the Company shall be
construed as if the term "material" and any references to "Company Material
Adverse Effect" (and variations thereof) were omitted from such
representations and warranties. The rights to recover amounts from the Escrow
Fund set forth in this **ARTICLE VIII**ARTICLE VIII shall not be affected by
(i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of Parent or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Parent, whether before or after the
date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or
noncompliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which
is the subject of recovery from the Escrow Fund hereunder, or (ii) any waiver
by Parent of any closing condition relating to the accuracy of representations
and warranties or the performance of or compliance with agreements and
covenants.

shall not be available to compensate any of the Covered Parties for any Losses
under **Section 8.3(a)(i)**, and no Covered Party shall be entitled to

with respect to any given claim for Losses under **Section 8.3(a)(i)**,
**Section 8.3(a)(iii) **and **Section 8.3(a)(v)**, such claim is
individually in excess of $62,500 (the " **Threshold Amount** ") (with the
understanding that even if a claim cannot be brought under **Section
8.3(a)(i) **because such claim is under the Threshold Amount, all Losses
incurred by a Covered Party under **Section 8.3(a)(i) **count toward meeting
the Deductible Amount), after which the Escrow Fund, subject to the terms of
this **ARTICLE VIII**, shall be available to compensate each of the Covered
Parties for any such Losses, and, subject to the terms of this **ARTICLE
VIII** the Covered Parties shall be entitled to seek recovery for such Losses
under **Section 8.3(a)(i) **that are in excess of the Deductible Amount in
the aggregate and under **Sections 8.3(a)(i) **(subject to satisfying the
Deductible Amount), **8.3(a)(iii) **and **8.3(a)(v) **that are in excess of
the Threshold Amount individually.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: (i) any Losses
recoverable from the Escrow Fund hereunder shall be reduced in amount by any,
insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or
reimbursements realized by any Covered Party in connection with such Losses or
any of the circumstances giving rise thereto; (ii) no Losses shall be
recoverable from the Escrow Fund hereunder that constitute punitive,
incidental or indirect damages; and (iii) the amount of any Loss subject to
recovery under this **ARTICLE VIII **shall be calculated net of any amounts
specifically accrued or reserved for in the Company Balance Sheet the
Companys unaudited balance sheet as of September 30, 2011 attached as
**Section 3.4** to the Company Disclosure Letter or factored into the Merger
Consideration calculation. In the event that any amount is distributed from
the Escrow Fund as recovery for any Loss and subsequently thereto, a Covered
Party realizes any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution
payments or reimbursements in connection with such Loss or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto, then such Covered Party shall remit an
amount (not to exceed the amount of such Loss and without duplication of any
reduction made pursuant to the foregoing clause (i)) equal to the amount of
such insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or
reimbursements, as the case may be, realized by such Covered Party in
connection with such Loss or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto to
the Securityholders Representative for the benefit of the Escrow
Participants, which amount shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent and become
part of the Escrow Fund or, if the Escrow Fund has previously been distributed
to the Escrow Participants, distributed directly to the Escrow Participants
based on their Pro Rata Portion; provided that the amount deemed to be
recovered under insurance policies will be net of (i) the applicable
deductible for such policies and (ii) any increase in the

 



      
 

 



 

premium for such policies to the extent arising out of the relevant Losses. No
financial metric "multiple" valuation methodology shall be used in calculating
the amount of any Losses for which recovery under this **ARTICLE VIII **is
permitted unless such Losses were awarded to a third party pursuant to a Third
Party Claim for which the Covered Parties were entitled to recovery pursuant
to this **ARTICLE VIII **and such claim for recovery was actually made and
provided that the foregoing calculation limitation shall not prohibit any
types of damages that are not otherwise expressly prohibited by this
Agreement. The calculation of Losses shall not include Losses arising from a
change in any applicable law or accounting principle following the Effective
Time.

 



 

(e) Each Covered Party shall use Reasonable Best Efforts to mitigate its
damages with respect to any Loss that may be subject to recovery hereunder,
including seeking to secure payments from insurance policies or any other
party that may be available to compensate the Covered Party for any such Loss.

 



 

(f) All claims for recovery for any Loss or Losses from the Escrow Fund shall
be made pursuant to and in accordance with, and be governed by the terms of,
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

 **8.4 _Exclusive Remedy_**. Other than for claims involving fraud or specific
performance pursuant to **Section 10.6**, from and after the Effective Time,
recovery from the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Covered Parties for any Losses suffered, sustained, incurred or accrued by any
Covered Party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Except with respect to its Pro Rata Portion of amounts
recovered by a Covered Party from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms
hereof, no Company Securityholder shall be liable to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Covered Party for any Losses or other remedies arising out
of, in connection with or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall limit a Covered Partys
remedies in the event of fraud.

 



 

 **8.5 _Distribution of Escrow Fund_**.

 



 

(a) Pursuant to **Section 2.10(c)(iii) **and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall deliver from the Escrow Fund an amount equal
to any negative Actual Adjustment to Parent.

 



 

(b) Upon the Escrow Termination Date, the then remaining amount of the Escrow
Fund (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any interest, dividends and
payments on the Escrow Amount that have not been deducted by Parent in order
to pay taxes on such amounts pursuant to **Section 8.2(a)**) and the then
remaining amount of the Representative Reimbursement Fund (the " **Escrow
Release Amount** ") shall promptly be delivered to the Escrow Participants;
provided, however, that the Escrow Fund shall not terminate with respect to
any amount (subject to the objection of the Securityholders Representative
and the subsequent arbitration of the claim in the manner provided in
**Section 8.6(c)**) that is reasonably necessary (based on the facts and
circumstances existing at the time) to satisfy any unsatisfied claims for
Losses specified in any Officers Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent
and the Securityholders Representative in good faith on or prior to the
Escrow Termination Date and in accordance with the provisions of this
**ARTICLE VIII**, and in the event any such claims exist, all or any portion
of the Representative Reimbursement Fund as specified by the Securityholders
Representative shall be retained by the Escrow Agent pending resolution of
such claims. As soon as each such claim has been resolved, the Escrow Agent
shall deliver the remaining portion of the Escrow Release Amount not required
to satisfy such claim or any remaining unresolved claims to the Escrow
Participants. Distributions of the Escrow Release Amount to the Escrow
Participants pursuant to this **Section 8.5 **shall be made in accordance
with the terms and conditions of

 



      
 

 



 

the Escrow Agreement and in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portion of
the remaining Escrow Amount, with each amount rounded to the nearest whole
cent ($0.01); provided that any distributions to be made to the holders of
Cashed-Out Options who remain employees of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for further delivery
to the holders of Cashed-Out Options pursuant to **Section 2.9(d)**.

 



 

 **8.6 _Claims Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) In the event that a Covered Party has a good faith claim for Losses for
which the Covered Party is seeking recovery from the Escrow Fund under this
**ARTICLE VIII**, Parent shall deliver promptly, and in any event on or
before the Escrow Termination Date, an Officers Certificate with respect to
such claim to both the Escrow Agent and the Securityholders Representative.
The Securityholders Representative may object in good faith to a claim for
recovery set forth in an Officers Certificate by delivering to Parent within
sixty (60) days from the date it receives the Officers Certificate (such
date, the " **Objection Deadline** "), a written statement of objection to one
or more of the claims made in the Officers Certificate (an " **Objection
Notice** "). If the Securityholders Representative does not object in writing
to all or any portion of the claims in the Officers Certificate by the
Objection Deadline, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable
acknowledgment by the Securityholders Representative and the Escrow
Participants that the Covered Party is entitled to recover from the Escrow
Fund the full amount of the Losses actually incurred or paid by the Covered
Party to which the Securityholders Representative does not so object, subject
to the limitations on recovery set forth in this **ARTICLE VIII**, and the
Securityholders Representative and Parent shall use Reasonable Best Efforts
to take all necessary actions to, to the extent that funds remain available in
the Escrow Fund, cause the Escrow Agent to distribute the amount of such
agreed upon Losses to Parent from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) If the Securityholders Representative delivers a timely Objection Notice,
the Securityholders Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith for
a period of not less than sixty (60) days to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to the claims asserted in the Officers
Certificate. If the Securityholders Representative and Parent should so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by both parties, who shall then, to the extent that funds remain available in
the Escrow Fund, furnish to the Escrow Agent a copy of such agreement and
cause the Escrow Agent to distribute the amount of such agreed upon Losses to
Parent from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum
and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
thereof.

 



 

(c) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
Parent or the Securityholders Representative may submit the disputed matter
to arbitration, unless the question as to whether the Covered Party is
entitled to recovery from the Escrow Fund or the amount of the Loss that is at
issue is the subject of a pending litigation with a third party, in which
event arbitration shall not be commenced until such entitlement is determined
or amount is ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration. Any such
arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with **Section 10.10**. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make distributions from the
Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of any award, judgment, decree or
order of the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be.

 



 

 **8.7 _Securityholders  Representative_**.

 



 

(a) By virtue of the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the requisite
consent of the Companys stockholders, each of the Escrow Participants (other
than such Escrow Participants, if any, to the extent such Escrow Participant
has properly asserted or exercised and perfected dissenters rights under the
NRS and who have not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters rights)
shall be deemed to have

 



      
 

 



 

agreed to appoint Fortis Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company as
its agent and attorney-in-fact (the " **Securityholders  Representative**")
for and on behalf of the Escrow Participants to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize payment to any Covered Party from the Escrow Fund
in satisfaction of claims by any Covered Party, to object to such payments, to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Covered Party
against any Escrow Participant or by any such Escrow Participant against any
Covered Party or any dispute between any Covered Party and any such
Stockholder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholders
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically
mandated by the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (it being
understood that all such actions shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable
outside this Agreement and be binding on the Escrow Participants as a matter
of contract law). Such agency may be changed by the Escrow Participants with
the right to a majority of the Pro Rata Portions of the Escrow Fund from time
to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholders Representative
may resign at any time by providing written notice of intent to resign to the
Escrow Participants, which resignation shall be effective upon the earlier of
(A) thirty (30) calendar days following delivery of such written notice or (B)
the appointment of a successor by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders Representative.

 



 

(b) The Securityholders Representative shall not be liable for any act done
or omitted hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement as Securityholders
Representative while acting in good faith, even if such act or omission
constitutes negligence on the part of such Securityholders Representative.
The Securityholders Representative shall only have the duties expressly
stated in this Agreement and shall have no other duty, express or implied. The
Securityholders Representative may engage attorneys, accountants and other
professionals and experts. The Securityholders Representative may in good
faith rely conclusively upon information, reports, statements and opinions
prepared or presented by such professionals, and any action taken by the
Securityholders Representative based on such reliance shall be deemed
conclusively to have been taken in good faith. The Escrow Participants shall
indemnify the Securityholders Representative and hold the Securityholders
Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred on the
part of the Securityholders Representative (so long as the Stockholders
Representative was acting in good faith in connection therewith) and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Securityholders Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable
fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Securityholders
Representative and travel expenses (" **Securityholders  Representative
Expenses**"). The Representative Reimbursement Fund shall be available to
reimburse the Securityholders Representative Expenses actually incurred by
the Securityholders Representative promptly following the Securityholders
Representative delivery to the Escrow Agent of a certificate setting forth
such Securityholders Representative Expenses actually incurred. Upon the
Escrow Termination Date, the balance of the Representative Reimbursement Fund
shall promptly be delivered to the Escrow Participants, except with respect to
any amount necessary to satisfy any pending certified requests made by the
Securityholders Representative for Securityholders Representative Expenses.
As soon as all such Securityholders Representative Expenses have been
properly paid, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the remaining portion of the
Representative Reimbursement Amount to the Escrow Participants pursuant to
**Section 8.5**. Deliveries from the Representative Reimbursement Fund to the
Escrow Participants pursuant to this **Section 8.7(b) **and the Escrow
Agreement shall be made in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portion of
the remaining Representative Reimbursement Amount, with each amount rounded to
the nearest whole cent ($0.01). If the Representative Reimbursement Fund is
insufficient to satisfy any Securityholders Representative Expenses, such
amounts may be recovered by the Securityholders Agent from the Escrow Fund
otherwise distributable to the Escrow Participants (and not distributed or
distributable to a Covered Person or subject to a pending

 



      
 

 



 

claim for recovery of Losses pursuant to an Officers Certificate delivered in
compliance with this Agreement) pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Escrow
Agreement, at the time of distribution, and such recovery will be made from
the Escrow Participants according to their respective Pro Rata Portions. No
provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall require the
Securityholders Representative to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its
powers, risks, duties or privileges under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders
Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement
pursuant to **Sections 9.4 or 9.5** , shall constitute a decision of the
Escrow Participants and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Escrow
Participants.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Surviving
Corporation to provide the Securityholders Representative with reasonable
access, during normal business hours to information about the Surviving
Corporation solely for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its
rights under this Agreement, subject to the Companys reasonable security and
confidentiality measures and insurance requirements.

 



 

 **8.8 _Third-Party Claims_**. In the event that a Covered Party becomes aware
of a third party claim (a " **Third Party Claim** ") that the Covered Party
reasonably believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund pursuant to
this **ARTICLE VIII**, Parent shall promptly, and in any event within twenty
(20) days, notify the Securityholders Representative of such claim, which
notice shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by Parent) the
facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of the
claimed damages; provided, however, that no delay on the part of Parent to
give such notice shall prohibit the Covered Person from recovering any
applicable Losses from the Escrow Fund except to the extent of any prejudice
resulting from such delay. Within twenty (20) days after delivery of such
notification, the Securityholders Representative may, upon written notice
thereof to Parent, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Claim
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent; provided that (i) the
Securityholders Representative may only assume control of such defense if (A)
it acknowledges in writing to Parent that any damages, fines, costs or other
liabilities that may be assessed against the Covered Party in connection with
such Third Party Claim constitute Losses for which the Covered Party shall be
entitled to recovery from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this **ARTICLE VIII**
and (B) the _ad damnum_ is less than or equal to the amount then remaining in
the Escrow Fund and (ii) the Securityholders Representative may not assume
control of the defense of a Third Party Claim involving criminal liability or
in which equitable relief is sought against the Covered Party. If the
Securityholders Representative does not, or is not permitted under the terms
hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Claim, Parent
shall control such defense. The party that controls any such defense is
referred to herein as the " **Controlling Party** ", and the party that does
not control the defense is referred to herein as the " **Non-controlling
Party** ". The Non-controlling Party may participate in such defense at its
own expense. The Controlling Party shall keep the Non-controlling Party
advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and
shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party
with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling
Party with such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party
Claim (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may
have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing
or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise
reasonably cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of
such Third Party Claim. The reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
Covered Party with respect to a Third Party Claim shall be considered Losses
for purposes of this Agreement if (i) the Covered Party controls the defense
of such Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of this **Section 8.8** or
(ii) the Securityholders Representative assumes control of such defense and
the Covered Party reasonably concludes that the Securityholders
Representative and the Covered Party have conflicting interests or different
defenses available with respect to such Third Party Claim, provided that in no
event shall the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (other than local
counsel) be deemed Losses hereunder. The Securityholders

 



       
 

 



 

Representative shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent
of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided that the consent of Parent shall not be required if the amount
remaining in the Escrow Fund is sufficient to pay any amounts payable pursuant
to such settlement or judgment and such settlement or judgment includes a
complete release of the Covered Party from further liability and has no other
adverse effect on the Covered Party. The Covered Party shall not agree to any
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Securityholders
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this **Section
8.8**, any Third Party Claims with respect to the matter set forth on
**Section 8.3(a)(vi) **of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be subject to
the terms set forth therein, and in the event of a conflict, the terms of said
**Section 8.3(a)(vi) **of the Company Disclosure Letter shall control.

 



 

 **8.9 _Subrogation_**. To the extent that any Covered Party is entitled to
recovery from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this **ARTICLE VIII**, the
Securityholders Representative shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be
subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights
of contribution and other rights of recovery) that any Covered Party may have
against any other Person with respect to any Losses, circumstances or matter
to which such recovery is directly or indirectly related. The Covered Parties
shall permit the Securityholders Representative to use the name of the
Covered Party in any transaction or in any proceeding or other matter
involving any such rights or remedies, and the Covered Party shall take such
actions as the Securityholders Representative may reasonably request for the
purpose of enabling the Securityholders Representative to perfect or exercise
the right of subrogation of the Covered Party under this **Section 8.9**.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 



 

 **9.1 _Termination_**. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to

**Section 9.1(b) **shall not be available to any party whose action or

untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in **Section 7.2(a)
**or **Section 7.2(b) **would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach
or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue,
provided that the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this

this Agreement pursuant to this **Section 9.1(e) **if either (i) at the time
it seeks to terminate the Agreement, Parent is in material breach of this
Agreement or (ii) if the breach by the Company that gave rise to Parents
termination right is cured during such thirty (30) day period so that such
conditions would then be satisfied);

 



 

(f) by Parent, at any time on or after the date that is one (1) calendar day
after the date hereof, if prior to such time as Parent delivers a valid notice
of termination under this **Section 9.1(f) **to the Company in accordance
with **Section 9.2**, the Company has not previously delivered a written
consent of the Company Stockholders executed by Company Stockholders holding
such number of shares of Company Capital Stock as is necessary to attain the

(g) by the Company in the event that all of the conditions set forth in

that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing), the Marketing Period has
ended, the Company delivers to Parent a notice that all of such conditions
have been satisfied and it is ready to close and a Closing is required to be
held pursuant to **Section 2.2** (assuming for such purposes the satisfaction
by Parent and/or the waiver by the Company of the conditions in **Section
7.2**) but Parent and Merger Sub fail to close within the time period
specified by **Section 2.2**.

 



 

 **9.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_**. Any termination of
this Agreement under **Section 9.1** will be effective immediately upon the
delivery of a valid written notice of the terminating party to the other party
hereto. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in
**Section 9.1**, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect,
except (a) as set forth in **Section 6.3(a)**, this **Section 9.2**,
**Section 9.3** and **ARTICLE X**, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for fraud or any willful breach of this Agreement. No
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 



 

 **9.3 _Fees and Expenses_**. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and expenses of financial
advisors, financial sponsors, legal counsel and other advisors, shall be paid

 **9.4 _Amendment_**. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, provided that
after approval and adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company, no amendment shall be made which requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without such further stockholder approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company; provided, that
after the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
Parent and the Securityholders Representative may cause this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement to be amended by execution of an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of Parent and the Securityholders Representative.

 



 

 **9.5 _Extension; Waiver_**. At any time at or prior to the Closing, any

warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such Person contained herein. Any agreement on

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. Without limiting the generality or
effect of the preceding sentence, no delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any breach
or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of the same
or any other provision in this Agreement.

issued thereunder, if such amendment or modification, or such rule or
regulation is effective, on or before the date on which the compliance with
such law or Legal Requirement is at issue; (x) whenever any payment to be made
or action to be taken hereunder is required to be made or taken on a day other
than a business day, such payment shall be made or action taken on the next
following business day and (xi) the words "include," "including" and other
similar words shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase "but not limited
to." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made herein to " **the
business of** " an entity, such reference shall be deemed to include the
business of such entity and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Any currency
thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a benchmark for the
determination of what is or is not "material" or a "Company Material Adverse
Effect" under this Agreement. When reference is made in this Agreement to
information that has been "made available" to Parent, that shall mean (A)
information included in the Companys electronic data room maintained at
www.intralinks.com under the name "Project Capital" no later than 5:00 p.m.,
Eastern Time, on the first business day prior to the date of this Agreement,
and (B) information provided directly to Parent or its counsel.

 



 

 **10.3 _Counterparts_**. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 



 

 **10.4 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_**. This Agreement and
the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Escrow Agreement and the certificates
delivered by the Company in connection herewith (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being
understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement
and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder and no Person is or shall be deemed to be a third party
beneficiary hereunder, except (w) for the right of the Company on behalf of
its Securityholders, to pursue damages or equitable remedies in the event of
Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement, (x) the rights of the
Subsidiary and the Company Representatives to be indemnified by Parent under
**Section 6.6,** (y) following the Effective Time, for such provisions that
act for the benefit of (A) the Company Securityholders set forth in **ARTICLE
II**, (B) the Company Indemnified Parties set forth in **Section 6.9** and
(C) the Covered Parties set forth in **ARTICLE VIII** and (z) the right of
each Financing Source and its successors and assigns to enforce the provisions
of **Sections 10.6, 10.10, 10.11 and 10.12.**

 



 

 **10.5 _Severability_**. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

 



 

 **10.6 _Specific Performance_**. The parties hereto hereby agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not
be an adequate remedy

 



      
 

 



 

for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company or,
following the Closing, the Securityholders Representative, on the one hand,
or Parent, Merger Sub and, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation,
on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set
forth in this Agreement, the Company or, following the Closing, the
Securityholders Representative, on the one hand, or Parent, Merger Sub and,
following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other(s) (as applicable), and
to seek to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement, in each case, in
addition to any other remedies available to each party at law and in equity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, hereby agree not to raise any objections to
the availability of such equitable remedies to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of **Section 6.6** by such party (or parties), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of **Section 6.6** to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such party (or parties) and its subsidiaries
under **Section 6.6**, and (ii) Parent hereby agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of such equitable remedies to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of Parent of its obligations to
consummate the Merger and pay the Merger Consideration (the " **Closing
Obligations** "), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the Closing Obligations in such circumstances where (A) the
conditions set forth in **Section 7.1** and **Section 7.3** have been
satisfied (other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing), (B) the Marketing Period has ended, (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail
to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to occur pursuant
to **Section 2.2** (assuming for such purposes the satisfaction by Parent and
Merger Sub or the waiver by the Company of the conditions in **Section 7.2**)
and (D) the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing has been funded or would
be funded at the Closing, if the Closing were to occur; provided that in the
case of clause (i) or (ii), no party shall hereby waive its right to defend
against any claim of breach or threatened breach that might otherwise give
rise to the ability to seek such equitable remedies.

 



 

 **10.7 _Other Remedies_**. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

 **10.8 _Governing Law_**. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof (other than to the extent that the laws of the State of Nevada
mandatorily apply, including NRS Chapters 78 and 92A).

 



 

 **10.9 _Waiver of Conflicts_**. The parties hereto (collectively, the "
**Consenting Parties** ") acknowledge that at all times relevant hereto up to
the Closing, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation ("
**WSGR** ") has represented only the Company. If subsequent to the Closing any
dispute were to arise relating in any manner to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement between the Securityholders Representative, on the one hand, and
another Consenting Party, on the other hand (each a " **Dispute** "), the
Consenting Parties consent to WSGRs representation of the Securityholders
Representative in the Dispute(s). The Consenting Parties acknowledge that WSGR
has been and will be providing legal advice to the Company in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and in such capacity will have obtained confidential
information of the Company (the " **Company Confidential Information** "). The
Company Confidential Information includes all communications, whether written
or electronic, including any communications between WSGR, the directors,
officers, stockholders, accounting firm, and/or employees of the Company, all
files, attorney notes, drafts or

 



      
 

 



 

other documents directly relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement,
which predate the Closing (collectively, the " **WSGR Work Product** "). In
any Dispute, to the extent that any Company Confidential Information is in
WSGRs possession at the Effective Time, such Company Confidential Information
may be used on behalf of the Securityholders Representative in connection
with such Dispute at the sole discretion of the Securityholders
Representative. In any Dispute, the Consenting Parties waive the right to
present any WSGR Work Product as evidence in any legal proceeding (including
arbitration) arising out of such Dispute. The Consenting Parties waive their
right to access any WSGR Work Product, except as reasonably necessary in
connection with a legal proceeding that is not a Dispute. The Consenting
Parties hereby consent to the disclosure and use by WSGR for the benefit of
the Company Securityholders and the Securityholders Representative of any
information (confidential or otherwise) disclosed to it by the Company
(including its directors, officers, Company Securityholders, accounting firm,
and/or employees of the Company) prior to the Effective Time. Except as
expressly set forth above, this **Section 10.9** shall not grant any rights
to the Securityholders Representative with respect to the Company
Confidential Information except as described herein.

 



 

 **10.10 _Arbitration_**. Subject to **Section 10.6**, claims, disputes or
controversies arising out of or relating to the matters set forth in **ARTICLE
VIII**, including any dispute concerning the arbitrability or the scope of
this arbitration provision, as it applies to the matters set forth in
**ARTICLE VIII**, shall be exclusively settled by binding arbitration under
the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. In the event
that, within forty-five (45) days after submission of any such claim, dispute
or controversy to arbitration, the parties to the arbitration cannot mutually
agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) days after the end of such
forty-five (45)-day period, each such party shall select one arbitrator. The
two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator, and the panel of
three arbitrators shall preside over the arbitration. Any such arbitration
shall be held exclusively in Wilmington, Delaware, under the rules then in
effect of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator(s) shall
determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration shall be paid,
including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of each arbitrator
and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association; provided,
however, that each party shall be responsible for its own attorneys fees and
costs, if any, relating to any arbitration pursuant to this **Section
10.10**. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a
limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the
sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about
the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions (excluding
attorneys fees and costs) to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial
justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall be final, binding, and conclusive. Such
decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact
and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order
awarded by the arbitrator(s). Within forty-five (45) days of a decision of the
arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall make
the payment to such other party, including any distributions out of the Escrow
Fund, as applicable. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, this
**Section 10.10 **applies solely to claims, disputes, controversies arising
out or relating to matters set forth in **ARTICLE VIII** and nothing in this
**Section 10.10** shall limit the availability of equitable remedies under
**Section 10.6**.

 



 

 **10.11 _Jurisdiction and Venue_**. Subject to **Section 10.10 **and
**Section 2.10**, each of the parties hereto submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the city and county of
New Castle, Delaware, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Debt
Financing, agrees that all claims in respect of the action or

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Debt Financing, in any
other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of summons and
complaint or any other process that might be served in any action or
proceeding may be made on such party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address of the party and in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in **Section 10.1**. Nothing in
this **Section 10.11**, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law. Each party hereto agrees
that a final, non appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States
District Court of the United States of America, sitting in Wilmington County,
Delaware (and appellate courts thereof).

 



 

 **10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_**. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE
DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO (INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING), IN EACH CASE
WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT,
EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND
CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR LIABILITY,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS **SECTION 10.12**.

 



 

 **10.13 _Rules of Construction_**. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

 



 

 **10.14 _Assignment_**. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this
**Section 10.14** shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



      
 

 



 

 **10.15 _No Waiver_**. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in
the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to
be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty
or agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.
