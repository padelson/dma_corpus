paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation outstanding immediately after the
Effective Time. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of

(i)  for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to
which a holder elects to receive Parent Non-Voting Common Stock pursuant to

Entry Share;

  

(iii)  a combination of the Non-Voting Common Stock Consideration

into Voting Common Stock Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)(_

(d)   _Cancellation of Company Converted Common Stock_. All of the
Company Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Article_ III shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and uncertificated Company Shares represented in book-entry form ("Book-
Entry Shares") and each certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, represented any such Company Shares (each, a "Certificate") shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
the Fractional Share Cash Amount, plus any dividends or other distributions
to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance
with _Section 3.5(_ d).

  

Section 3.2 _Election Procedures_.

  



    

(a)  Holders of Company Common Stock may elect to receive shares of
Parent Non-Voting Common Stock (a "Non-Voting Stock Election") or Parent
Voting Common Stock (a "Voting Stock Election") (in either case
without interest) in exchange for their Company Shares in accordance with the
procedures set forth herein. Shares of Parent Non-Voting Common Stock as to
which a Non-Voting Election (including, pursuant to a Mixed Election) has been
made are referred to herein as "Non-Voting Election Shares". Shares of Parent
Voting Common Stock as to which a Voting Election (including, pursuant to a
Mixed Election) has been made are referred to herein as "Voting Election
Shares".

  

(b)  An election form and other appropriate and customary
transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent), in such form as Company
and Parent shall mutually agree ("Election Form"), shall be mailed no more
than forty (40) Business Days and no less than twenty (20) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Effective Time or on such earlier date as Company
and Parent shall mutually agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record
of Company Common Stock as of five (5) Business Days prior to the Mailing
Date (the "Election Form Record Date"). Each Election Form shall permit such
holder, subject to the election procedures set forth in this _Section_ 3.2,
(i) to elect to receive the Non-Voting Common Stock Consideration for all of
the Company Shares held by such holder, in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)(_
i); (ii) to elect to receive the Voting Common Stock Consideration for all of
such Company Shares, in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)(_ ii); (iii) to elect
to receive the Non-Voting Common Stock Consideration for a part of such
holder's Company Common Stock and Voting Common Stock Consideration for the
remaining part of such holder's Company Common Stock; or (iv) to indicate
that such record holder has no preference as to the receipt of Parent Non-
Voting Common Stock or Parent Voting Common Stock for such Company Shares. A
holder of record of Company Shares who holds such Company Shares as nominee,
trustee or in another representative capacity (a "Holder Representative") may
submit multiple Election Forms, provided that each such Election Form covers
all the Company Shares held by such Holder Representative for a particular
beneficial owner. Any Company Shares with respect to which the holder thereof
shall not, as of the Election Deadline, have made an election by submission to
the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly completed Election Form shall be
deemed Non-Election Shares.

   

19 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(c)  To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be
submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., (Pacific time), on
the twentieth (20th) day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and
date as the Company and Parent may mutually agree) (the "Election Deadline");
_provided, however_ , that the Election Deadline may not occur on or after
the Closing Date. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
available up to two separate Election Forms, or such additional Election
Forms as Parent may permit, to all Persons who become holders (or beneficial
owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the
close of business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline. The
Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein. An election shall have been
properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a
properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form
shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by one or more
Certificates (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss
or destruction of such Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such
Certificates) and/or evidence of Book-Entry Shares representing all Company
Shares covered by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal
materials included with the Election Form. If a holder of Company Common Stock
either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form in a timely
fashion or (ii) revokes its Election Form prior to the Election Deadline
(without later submitting a properly completed Election Form prior to the
Election Deadline), the Company Shares held by such stockholder shall be
designated as Non-Election Shares. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed
by the person submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written
notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice of revocation or change
is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election
Deadline. Parent shall cause the Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares
relating to any revoked Election Form to be promptly returned without charge
to the person submitting the Election Form to the Exchange Agent. Subject to
the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have discretion to determine when any election, modification or revocation is
received and whether any such election, modification or revocation has been
properly made. All elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange
Agent is notified in writing by Parent or the Company, upon exercise by
Parent or the Company of its respective or their mutual rights to terminate
this Agreement to the extent provided under _Article_ VIII, that this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article_ VIII.

  

Section 3.3 _Company Stock Options and Company Warrants_.

  



    

(a)   _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. The Company and Parent
shall take all actions reasonably necessary (including any required notices
by the Company) to provide that, effective as of the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Stock Option will be assumed by Parent. Each Company
Stock Option assumed by Parent will continue to have, and be subject to, the
same material terms and conditions of such option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (i) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable
for a number of shares of Parent Voting Common Stock equal to the product of
the number of Company Shares that would have been issuable upon exercise of
the Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent
Voting Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock
Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per share
exercise price for such Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. The holder of a Company Stock Option may elect to receive shares of
Parent Non-Voting Common Stock, Parent Voting Common Stock or a combination
thereof upon exercise of such Company Stock Option. The exercise price and
the number of shares purchasable pursuant to the assumed Company Stock Options
as well as the terms and conditions of exercise of such assumed options shall
be designed to comply with Sections 424(a) and 409A of the Code. Any
restriction on the exercisability of such Company Stock Option will continue
in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule or
other provisions of such Company Stock Option will remain unchanged. The
Merger will not terminate any of the outstanding Company Stock Options or
accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such Company Stock Options or the
shares of Parent Voting Common Stock underlying the Company Stock Options
upon Parent's assumption thereof in the Merger.

   

20 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(b)   _Treatment of Company Warrants_. To the extent the Company
Warrants have not been terminated in accordance with their terms, at the
Effective Time, (i) each outstanding warrant to purchase Company Shares (a
"Company Warrant") shall by virtue of the Merger be assumed by Parent subject
to the terms of such Company Warrant and (ii) the Company shall take all
actions reasonably necessary, including any required notices by the Company,
to provide that, effective as of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Warrant will be assumed by Parent. Each Company Warrant assumed by Parent will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such
warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (A) each Company
Warrant will be exercisable for a number of shares of Parent Voting Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that would have
been issuable upon exercise of the Company Warrant outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Voting Common Stock, and (B)
the per share exercise price for the Parent Voting Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such assumed Company Warrant will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the per share exercise price for such Company Warrant
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The holder of a Company Warrant may
elect to receive shares of Parent Non-Voting Common Stock, Parent Voting
Common Stock or a combination thereof upon exercise of such Company
Warrant. Any restriction on the exercisability of such Company Warrant will
continue in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability or other
provisions of such Company Warrant will remain unchanged. Consistent with the
terms of the Company Warrants, the Merger will not accelerate the
exercisability of such Company Warrants or the shares of Parent Voting Common
Stock underlying the Company Warrants upon Parent's assumption thereof in the
Merger.

  

Section 3.4 _Dissenters ' Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares which are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders who shall have complied with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, and holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL, unless and until the applicable holder fails to comply with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL or effectively withdraws or otherwise
loses such holder's rights to receive payment of the fair value of such
holder's Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to comply with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration and the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall remain liable for payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ 3.4, if this Agreement
is terminated prior to the Effective Time, then the right of any holder of
Company Common Stock to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company shall give
Parent notice of any written demands for appraisal of Company Common Stock
received by the Company under Section 262 of the DGCL, and shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with
respect thereto. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, (i) make any payment with respect to any such demands for
appraisal or (ii) offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 3.5   _Exchange Procedures_.

  



    

(a)   _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for
the payment of Merger Consideration and shall enter into an agreement (the
"Exchange Agent Agreement") relating to the Exchange Agent's responsibilities
under this Agreement, which Exchange Agent Agreement shall be subject to the
reasonable approval of the Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for
the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, for exchange in accordance with
this _Article_ III through the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Stock in
book-entry form representing the number of shares of Parent Stock sufficient
to deliver the applicable Merger Consideration and (ii) an amount of cash
sufficient to make Fractional Share Cash Amount payments in accordance with
_Section 3.5(_ e) (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). Parent further agrees
to provide to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, immediately
available funds sufficient to pay any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section 3.5(_ c). Pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver the applicable Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund to the former Company stockholders who
are entitled thereto pursuant to _Section_  3.1. Except as contemplated by
_Section 3.5(_ c) and _Section 3.5(_ e) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. Parent shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Exchange Agent, incurred by it in connection with the
exchange of Company Shares for the Merger Consideration and other amounts
contemplated by this _Article_ III.

  

(b)   _Surrender of Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, together with such Election Form,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the
shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been
converted pursuant to this Agreement, together with the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 3.5(_ c), if
any, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article_ III. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to _Section
3.5(_ c) or _Section 3.5(_ e). In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be issued and paid with respect to such Company
Shares to such a transferee if the Certificate or sufficient evidence of Book-
Entry Shares representing such transferred Company Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with this _Section 3.5(_ b), accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and evidence that any
applicable stock Transfer Taxes have been paid.

   

22 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(c)   _Dividends and Distributions; Treatment of Unexchanged
Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the Parent Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered share of
Company Common Stock who is entitled to receive Parent Stock upon such
surrender, and no Fractional Share Cash Amount payment in respect of
fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 3.5(_
e), unless and until the holder of such Company Common Stock shall surrender
such Company Common Stock in accordance with  _Section 3.5(_ b). Subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of
any such Company Common Stock, there shall be paid to the holder of the stock
certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing whole shares of Parent Stock
to be issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, (A) the
amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Stock
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.5(_ e) and (B) the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
the date of surrender of such holder's Company Common Stock and a payment date
occurring after the date of surrender, payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Stock.

  

(d)   _Full Satisfaction_. The Merger Consideration delivered upon
surrender of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
(including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.5(_ c)) shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the such
Company Shares.

  

(e)   _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Stock
shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip
for any such fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Stock, after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Stock
issuable to such holder, shall in lieu of such fraction of a share and upon
surrender of such holder's Certificates, be paid in cash the dollar amount
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by
multiplying such fraction by the VWAP of the Parent Stock during the five (5)
Trading Days immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Fractional Share
Cash Amount"). As soon as practicable after the determination of the
Fractional Share Cash Amount to be paid to former holders of Company
Shares in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock, the Exchange Agent
shall distribute such amounts to such former holders.

   

23 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(f)   _Termination of Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares nine (9) months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and, from and
after such delivery to Parent, any holders of Company Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article_ III shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company Shares
and any cash paid in respect of the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Stock to which they
are entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.5(_ c), in each case, without any
interest thereon. Neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock
for any such shares of Parent Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(g)   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent or Exchange Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or Exchange Agent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares represented by such
Certificate, any cash paid in respect of the Fractional Share Cash Amount and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.5(_ c), in each case, without any interest
thereon.

  

(h)   _Withholding Taxes_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts
as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

  

(i)   _Exchange Fund Cash_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
_provided, however_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to the holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
_Article_ III. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund
pursuant to _Section 3.5(_ f). In the event the cash in the Exchange Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Exchange Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such payment obligations.

   

24 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(j)   _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares, all holders of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as
Company stockholders other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration
into which the shares represented by such Certificates and/or Book-Entry
Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of
such Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 3.5(_
b) (together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with _Section 3.5(_ c)), without interest. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing Company Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article_ III,
subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares. Any cash paid
in respect of the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.5(_ c), in each case, net of any required withholding for Taxes and without
any interest thereon.

  

Section 3.6 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Company Shares or Parent Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
reclassification, redenomination, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and
any other dependent items shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the
holders of Company Shares the same economic and proportional effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action and as so adjusted shall,
from and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration or other
dependent item, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this
sentence; _provided, however,_ that nothing in this _Section_ 3.6 shall be
constrained to permit the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to
its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

and effect immediately after the Effective Time.

required to be filed by it (taking into account any applicable extensions),
and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material
respects and prepared in compliance with all applicable Laws and (ii) timely
paid all Taxes due and owing (whether or not shown due on any Tax Returns).
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary

ever been made by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company
and its Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has commenced activities in any
jurisdiction which will result in an initial filing of a Tax Return with
respect to Taxes imposed by a Governmental Entity that it had not previously
been required to file in the immediately preceding taxable period.

  

(b)  The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries did not,
as of September 30, 2014, exceed the reserve for Tax Liabilities (excluding

between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance sheets
(rather than in any notes thereto) contained in the Financial Statements.
Since September 30, 2014, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any Liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or
otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

(c)  There are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or asset of the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof, except for Liens for current Taxes the
payment of which is not yet delinquent, or for Taxes contested in good faith
through appropriate proceedings and reserved against in accordance with GAAP.

  

(d)  Except as set forth in _Section 4.11(_ d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no deficiencies for Taxes with respect to any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries have been set forth or claimed in writing, or
proposed or assessed by a Governmental Entity. There are no pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, proposed or threatened audits, investigations,
disputes or claims or other actions for or relating to any Liability for
Taxes with respect to any of the Company and its Subsidiaries. No
material issues relating to Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company were raised by the relevant Governmental Entity in any completed
audit or examination that would reasonably be expected to recur in a later
taxable period. The Company has made available to Parent in the Dataroom true
and complete copies of federal, state and local income Tax Returns of each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their predecessors for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, and true and complete copies of all
examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed
to by any of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any predecessor, with
respect to Taxes. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
predecessor has waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or
agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency, or has made any request in writing for any such extension or
waiver. There is not currently in effect any power of attorney authorizing any
Person to act on behalf of the Company, or receive information relating to
the Company, with respect to any Tax matter.

  

(e)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested
or received any ruling from any Governmental Entity, or signed any binding
agreement with any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any
advance pricing agreement) that would affect any amount of Tax payable after
the Closing Date and has not made any request for issuance of a ruling from a
Governmental Entity on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(regardless of whether the requested ruling is still pending or withdrawn).

  

(f)  Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid
all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts
paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder
or other third party, and all Tax Returns (including without limitation all
IRS Forms W-2 and 1099) required with respect thereto have been properly
completed and timely filed with, and supplied to, the appropriate parties.

  

(g)  Except for any such customary agreements with customers,

business (each of which is not specifically entered into to address Taxes),
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by or

(h)  Except for the affiliated group of which the Company is the
common parent, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not and has never
been a member of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of
Section 1504 of the Code or any group that has filed a combined, consolidated
or unitary Tax Return. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
liable for the Taxes of any Person (including an individual, corporation,
general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
estate, trust, association, organization, labor union or other entity or
Governmental Entity) other than the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law), (ii) as a transferee or successor, (iii) by Contract,
or (iv) otherwise.

  

(i)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or subject to any joint venture, partnership or other agreement or
arrangement which is treated as a partnership for federal income Tax purposes.

  

(j)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation"
in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under
Section 355 of the Code.

  

(k)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action, failed to take any action, or knows of any fact that would be
reasonably expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

(l)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
party to a "reportable transaction," as such term is defined in Treasury

analogous provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law.

  

(m)  Except as set forth in _Section 4.11(m)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made

would require an adjustment to its income pursuant to Section 481(a) of the
Code (or any similar provision) on any Tax Return for any taxable period for
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has not yet filed a Tax Return.
No application is pending with any Governmental Entity requesting permission
to make any change in any accounting method that would require such an
adjustment, nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries received any notice
that a Governmental Entity proposes to require a change in method of
accounting used in any Tax Return which has been filed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that would require such an adjustment.

  

(n)  The Company has not taken any action not in accordance with past
practice that would have the effect of deferring a measure of Tax from a
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Execution Date to a period
(or portion thereof) beginning after the Execution Date. Except to the extent
adequately reserved for in the Unaudited Financial Statements, the Company has
no deferred income or other Tax Liability arising out of any transaction,
including, without limitation, any (i) intercompany transaction (as defined
in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-13), (ii) the disposal of any property
in a transaction accounted for under the installment method pursuant to
Section 453 of the Code, (iii) excess loss account (as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-19) with respect to the stock of any Subsidiary of

Section 4.12 _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

    

(a)   _Section 4.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes

respect to each of the written Company Benefit Plans, the Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of the following documents to
the extent applicable: (i) the governing plan document, all amendments
thereto and related trust documents, group contracts, insurance policies or
other funding arrangements, and amendments thereto; (ii) the three most
recently filed Forms 5500 annual returns and all schedules thereto, including
any audited financial statements and auditors' opinions; (iii) the most
recent favorable determination, opinion or advisory letter issued by the IRS;

(b)  The Company and its Subsidiaries have operated and administered
each of the Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms and all the
provisions of Laws and regulations applicable to the Company Benefit Plans.
All contributions, reserves or premium payments required to be made or
accrued as of the date hereof with respect to the Company Benefit Plans have
been timely paid or accrued by the Company and its Subsidiaries as
applicable. The Company and its Subsidiaries have satisfied all reporting and
disclosure requirements under the Code and ERISA that are applicable to the
Company Benefit Plans. No event or condition exists which would reasonably be
expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Liability in
connection with the Company Benefit Plans or any plan, program, or policy
sponsored or contributed to by any of their respective ERISA Affiliates other
than the provision of benefits thereunder in the ordinary course. With
respect to each applicable Company Benefit Plan, (i) there are no pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened actions which have been asserted
or instituted and which would reasonably be expected to result in any
Liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than routine claims
for benefits payable in the ordinary course); (ii) there are no audits,
inquiries or Proceedings pending or threatened by any governmental
authority; and (iii) there has been no breach of fiduciary duty (including
violations under Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA) which has resulted
or would reasonably be expected to result in material Liability to the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective employees.

(c)  In no event will the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or any other related agreement, the consummation of the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or the Company Stockholder
Approval (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as
termination of employment) result in, cause the accelerated vesting,
exercisability, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of,
any material payment or benefit to any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any beneficiary or
dependent thereof or result in a limitation on the right of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust.

  

(d)   _Section 4.12(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be a "qualified
plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code or is intended to be
similarly qualified or registered under applicable foreign law (collectively,
the "Company Qualified Plans"). Each Company Qualified Plan that is intended
to be tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS that it is entitled to rely
upon, and its accompanying trust is exempt from taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or event
has occurred since the date of such letter that would reasonably be expected
to jeopardize the tax-qualified status of any such Company Qualified Plan or
the tax-exempt status of its accompanying trust.

  

(e)  Except as otherwise provided in _Section 4.12(_ e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan provides health benefits
(whether or not insured) with respect to employees or former employees (or any
of their beneficiaries) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after
retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage or benefits
(A) required to be provided under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or
any other similar applicable Law or (B) the full cost of which is borne by
the employee or former employee (or any of their beneficiaries)).

  

(f)  Except as otherwise provided in _Section 4.12(_ f) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates sponsor, contribute to or have any
Liabilities with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that: (i) is subject to
Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430, 431 or 432 of the Code;
(ii) is a Multiemployer Plan; or (iii) is a multiple employer plan that is
described in Section 413 of the Code. No "reportable event," as such term is
defined in ERISA Section 4043(c), has occurred or is continuing with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan. No Company Benefit Plan that is or was subject to
Title IV of ERISA has been terminated and no proceeding has been initiated to
terminate any such plan. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred or reasonably expects
to incur, any Liability to the PBGC with respect to any Company Benefit Plan,
except for required premium payments, which payments have been timely made
when due. The market value of assets under each Company Benefit Plan that is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code equals or exceeds the
present value of all vested and nonvested Liabilities thereunder determined
in accordance with PBGC methods, factors and assumptions applicable to a plan
terminating on the date of determination. No Company Benefit Plan that is
subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA),
whether or not waived.

(g)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred or expects to incur any "withdrawal
liability" (as defined in ERISA Section 4201) under or with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan.

  

(h)  No Company Benefit Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction
of the United States, or covers any employee, contractor or other service
provider residing or working outside the United States.

  

(i)  There is no Contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party, including but not
limited to the provisions of this Agreement, that, individually or
collectively, would give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code.

  

(j)  No payment pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Arrangement between Company or a Subsidiary and any "service
provider" (as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and the United
States Treasury Regulations and IRS guidance thereunder), including, without
limitation, the grant, vesting or exercise of any equity option, would
subject any Person to a tax pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, whether
pursuant to the consummation of the Merger, any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

  

(k)  Each Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Arrangement, or
other Contract, plan, program, agreement, or arrangement that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated in compliance with Section 409A of
the Code, its Treasury regulations, and any applicable administrative
guidance relating thereto; and no additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B)
of the Code has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by a
participant in any such Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Arrangement, or
other Contract, plan, program, agreement, or arrangement. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate is a party to, or otherwise obligated under, any
Contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that provides for the gross-up of
taxes imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

  

(l)  Except as set forth on _Section 4.12(l)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no amount that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property), as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any other related agreement, the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or the stockholder
approval of the Merger (either alone or in conjunction with any other event,
such as termination of employment), by any employee, officer or director of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
under any Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Arrangement or otherwise could
be characterized as a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2)
of the Code). The Company has made available to Parent all necessary
information to determine, as of the date hereof, the estimated maximum amount
that could be paid to each disqualified individual in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under all employment, severance
and termination agreements, other compensation arrangements, Company Benefit
Arrangements and Company Benefit Plans currently in effect, assuming that
the individual's employment with the Company is terminated immediately after
the Effective Time. The Company has made available to Parent in the Dataroom
(i) the grant dates, exercise prices and vesting schedules applicable to each
Company Option granted to the individual; (ii) the "base amount" (as defined
in Section 280G(b)(e) of the Code) for each such individual as of the date of
this Agreement; and (iii) the maximum additional amount that the Company has
an obligation to pay to each disqualified individual to reimburse the
disqualified individual for any excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the
Code with respect to the disqualified individual's excess parachute payments
(including any taxes, interest or penalties imposed with respect to
the excise tax).

the business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by the Company
or such Subsidiary or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information
of others. As of the date hereof, no exempt employee of the Company or any of

made or obtained, as the case may be, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.5 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

    

(a)  Since January 1, 2013, Parent has timely filed all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by it
with the SEC pursuant to the reporting requirements of NASDAQ and the Exchange
Act (all of the foregoing filed prior to the date hereof and all exhibits
included therein and financial statements, notes and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein being hereinafter referred to as
the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates, the Parent SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to the Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC
Documents, at the time they were filed with the SEC, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
their respective dates, the financial statements of Parent included in the
Parent SEC Documents (the "Parent Financial Statements") complied as to form
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as in effect
as of the time of filing. Such financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently
applied, during the periods involved (except (i) as may be otherwise
indicated in such financial statements or the notes thereto, or (ii) in the
case of unaudited interim statements, to the extent they may exclude footnotes
or may be condensed or summary statements) and fairly present in all material
respects the financial position of Parent as of the dates thereof and the
results of its operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments
which will not be material, either individually or in the aggregate). Parent
is not currently contemplating to amend or restate any of the Parent
Financial Statements (including without limitation, any notes or any letter of
the independent accountants of Parent with respect thereto) included in the
Parent SEC Documents, nor is Parent currently aware of facts or circumstances
which would require Parent to amend or restate any of the Parent Financial
Statements, in each case, in order for any of the Parent
Financials Statements to be in compliance with GAAP and the rules and
regulations of the SEC. Parent has not been informed by its
independent accountants that they recommend that Parent amend or restate any
of the Parent Financial Statements or that there is any need for Parent to
amend or restate any of the Parent Financial Statements.

  

(b)  Parent is in compliance with all applicable requirements of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are effective as of the date hereof, and all
applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder that are
effective as of the date hereof.

  

(c)  Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries maintains internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) that is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, including that (i) transactions are executed in
accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to
maintain asset and liability accountability; (iii) access to assets or
incurrence of liabilities is permitted only in accordance with management's
general or specific authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets and liabilities is compared with the existing assets and liabilities
at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
difference. Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term
is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are effective in
ensuring that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, including, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to Parent's management, including its principal executive
officer or officers and its principal financial officer or officers, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Section 5.6 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Liabilities (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), except Liabilities: (a) as and to the extent set
forth on the audited consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries
as of the Balance Sheet Date; or (b) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Since the Balance Sheet Date, Parent has collected its accounts
receivable and paid its accounts payable in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice. No material event or development has occurred
with respect to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
businesses, properties, prospects, operations (including results thereof) or
condition (financial or otherwise), since the filing of Parent's Form 10-Q for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 through the date hereof,
that would be required to be disclosed by Parent under applicable securities
Laws on a registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on the date
hereof relating to an issuance of securities or would be reasonably likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

    

Section 5.7 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending, or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors, managers or officers (in their
capacities as such or relating to their employment, services or relationship
with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) or that would materially relate to or
affect Parent and Merger Sub or any of its Subsidiaries, before any court or
other Governmental Entity or any arbitrator which would reasonably be expected
to individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has committed a
violation of any judgment, decree, injunction or order of any Governmental
Entity applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective
properties or assets. Since January 1, 2013, there has not been any internal
investigations or inquiries conducted by Parent, the Parent Board (or any
committee thereof) or any other Person at the request of any of the foregoing
concerning any financial, accounting, Tax, conflict of interest, self-dealing,
fraudulent or deceptive conduct or other misfeasance or malfeasance issues.
Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of
the directors, managers or officers of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in
their capacities as such or relating to their employment, services or
relationship with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as applicable) is subject
to any judgment, decree, injunction or order of any Governmental Entity.
Neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries has any action, suit, proceeding, claim,
mediation, arbitration or investigation pending against any other Person.

    

Section 5.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since September
30, 2014, there has been no material adverse change and no material adverse
development in the business, assets, liabilities, properties, operations
(including results thereof), condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Since September 30, 2014, neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) sold any assets, individually or in the
aggregate, outside of the ordinary course of business or (ii) through the date
hereof made any material capital expenditures, individually or in the
aggregate. Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any steps to seek
protection pursuant to any law or statute relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, liquidation or winding up, nor does Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries have any knowledge or reason to believe that any of
their respective creditors intend to initiate involuntary bankruptcy
proceedings or any actual knowledge of any fact which would reasonably lead a
creditor to do so.

Section 5.9 _Compliance with Applicable Law; Permits_.

    

(a)  Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all material authorizations,
permits, licenses, certificates, easements, concessions, franchises,
variances, exemptions, orders, consents, registrations, approvals and
clearances of all Governmental Entities (including, without limitation, all
those that may be required by Governmental Entities engaged in the regulation
of Parent's products) which are required for Parent and its Subsidiaries to
own, lease, license and operate their properties and other assets and
to carry on their respective business in the manner described in the Parent
SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof and as they are being conducted
as of the date hereof (the "Parent Permits"), and all Parent Permits are
valid, and in full force and effect, except where the failure to have, or the
suspension or cancellation of, or the failure to be valid or in full force
and effect of, any such Parent Permits would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(b)  Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and have been at all times, in
compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits and all applicable Laws
relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets
or properties, except where the failure to be in compliance with the terms of
the Parent Permits or such applicable Law would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
To the Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notification from any Governmental Entity (i) asserting
that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any Law or
Parent Permit, or (ii) threatening to revoke any Parent Permit.

  

Section 5.10 _Taxes_.

    

(a)  Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has (i) duly and timely
filed with the appropriate Governmental Entity all Tax Returns required to be
filed by it (taking into account any applicable extensions), and all such Tax
Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects and prepared
in compliance with all applicable Laws and (ii) timely paid all Taxes due and
owing (whether or not shown due on any Tax Returns). Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by a Governmental
Entity in a jurisdiction where Parent and its Subsidiaries do not file Tax
Returns that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
commenced activities in any jurisdiction which will result in an initial
filing of a Tax Return with respect to Taxes imposed by a Governmental Entity
that it had not previously been required to file in the immediately preceding
taxable period.

  

(b)  The unpaid Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries did not, as of
September 30, 2014, materially exceed the reserve for Tax Liabilities
(excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the balance
sheets (rather than in any notes thereto) contained in the Financial
Statements. Since September 30, 2014, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any Liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course
of business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

   

56 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(c)  There are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or asset of
Parent or any Subsidiary thereof, except for Liens for current Taxes the
payment of which is not yet delinquent, or for Taxes contested in good faith
through appropriate proceedings and reserved against in accordance with GAAP.

  

(d)  No material deficiencies for Taxes with respect to any of
Parent and its Subsidiaries have been set forth or claimed in writing, or
proposed or assessed by a Governmental Entity. There are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, proposed or threatened audits, investigations, disputes
or claims or other actions for or relating to any Liability for Taxes with
respect to any of Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
Parent's Subsidiary, Pacific Ethanol Madera LLC, is currently under audit for
tax years 2011 through 2014 in respect of property taxes. No material issues
relating to Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company were raised
by the relevant Governmental Entity in any completed audit or examination that
would reasonably be expected to recur in a later taxable period. There are no
examination reports or statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed
to by any of Parent and its Subsidiaries or any predecessor, with respect to
Taxes. None of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor has waived
any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of
time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, or has made any request
in writing for any such extension or waiver.

  

(e)  Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has withheld and paid all
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or
other third party, and all Tax Returns (including without limitation all IRS
Forms W-2 and 1099) required with respect thereto have been properly completed
and timely filed with, and supplied to, the appropriate parties.

  

(f)  Except for any such customary agreements with customers,
vendors, lenders, lessors or the like entered into in the ordinary course of
business (each of which is not specifically entered into to address Taxes),
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by or has
any obligation under any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement
or similar contract or arrangement or any agreement that obligates it to make
any payment computed by reference to the Taxes, taxable income or
taxable losses of any other Person.

  

(g)  Except for the affiliated group of which Parent is the common
parent, each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is not and has never been a
member of an affiliated group of corporations within the meaning of Section
1504 of the Code or any group that has filed a combined, consolidated or
unitary Tax Return. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable for
the Taxes of any Person (including an individual, corporation, general or
limited partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, labor union or other entity or Governmental Entity)
other than Parent and its Subsidiaries (i) under Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (ii) as a
transferee or successor, (iii) by Contract, or (iv) otherwise.

(h)  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section
355 of the Code.

  

(i)  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action, failed to take any action, or knows of any fact that would be
reasonably expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

(j)  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a party
to a "reportable transaction," as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(1) (other than such transactions that have
been properly reported) or any other transaction requiring disclosure under
analogous provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law.

  

(k)  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a United
States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section
897(c)(2) of the Code at any time during the preceding five (5) years.

  

(l)  Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested or
received any ruling from any Governmental Entity, or signed any binding
agreement with any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any
advance pricing agreement) that would affect any amount of Tax payable after
the Closing Date and has not made any request for issuance of a ruling from a
Governmental Entity on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(regardless of whether the requested ruling is still pending or withdrawn).

  

(m)  Parent has provided to the Company its good faith estimate of
the amount of any net operating loss and net capital loss available for use
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, which Tax attributes of Parent are
limited in their use under Sections 382 of the Code (and similar provisions
of state, local or foreign Tax Law).

  

Section 5.11 _Environmental Matters_. Parent and its Subsidiaries (i)
are in compliance with all Environmental Laws, (ii) have received all permits,
licenses or other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental
Laws to conduct their respective businesses and (iii) are in compliance with
all terms and conditions of any such permit, license or approval, except
where, in each of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the failure to so
comply would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.12 _Contracts_. The Exhibit Index to Parent's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 or the Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K filed subsequent to such Form 10-K
list each Contract that would be required to be filed by Parent as a "material
contract" pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K in such reports (each,
a "Parent Material Contract"). Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent is
in breach or violation of or default in any material respect under the terms
of any Parent Material Contract and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no other
party to any Parent Material Contract is in breach or violation of or default
in any material respect under the terms of any Parent Material Contract and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred or not occurred through
Parent's or any of its Subsidiaries' action or inaction or, to Parent's
Knowledge, through the action or inaction of any third party, that with notice
or the lapse of time or both would constitute a breach or violation of or
default under the terms of any Parent Material Contract, in each case except
as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent, each Parent Material Contract (i)
is a valid and binding obligation of Parent or the Subsidiary of Parent that
is party thereto and of each other party thereto and (ii) is in full force and
effect except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws relating to or affecting the rights
and remedies of creditors generally and the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
Proceeding in equity or at Law). There are no disputes pending or, to Parent's
Knowledge, threatened with respect to any Parent Material Contract and neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of the
intention of any other party to a Parent Material Contract to terminate for
default, convenience or otherwise any Parent Material Contract, nor to the
Parent's Knowledge, is any such party threatening to do so, in each case
except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

    

Section 5.13 _Business Relationships._ Parent has made available to the
Company the top ten (10) suppliers (based on current fiscal year expenditures)
of products or services and the top ten (10) customers (based on current
fiscal year revenues) of Parent and Parent's Subsidiaries (on a consolidated
basis). Since the Balance Sheet Date, to the Knowledge of Parent, there has
not been any material adverse change in the business relationship of Parent or
any of Parent's Subsidiaries with any such customer or supplier or any change
or development that is reasonably likely to give rise to any such material
adverse change, and neither Parent nor any of Parent's Subsidiaries has
received any written or oral communication or notice from any such customer or
supplier to the effect that, or otherwise has Knowledge that, any such
customer or supplier (a) has changed, modified, amended or reduced, or is
reasonably likely to change, modify, amend or reduce its business relationship
with Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries in a manner that is, or is
reasonably likely to be materially adverse to Parent or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries, or (b) will fail to perform, or is reasonably likely to fail to
perform, its obligations under any Contract with Parent or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries in any manner that is, or is reasonably likely to be materially
adverse to the business and operations of Parent or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries.

    

Section 5.14 _Transactions with Affiliates_. None of the officers,
directors, employees or Affiliates of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
presently a party to any transaction with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than for ordinary course services as employees, officers or directors),
including any Contract or other arrangement providing for the furnishing of
services to or by, providing for rental of real or personal property to or
from, or otherwise requiring payments to or from any such officer, director,
employee or affiliate or, to the Knowledge of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, any corporation, partnership, trust or other Person in which any
such officer, director, or employee has a substantial interest or is an
employee, officer, director, trustee, affiliate or partner.

agents or any other person acting for or on behalf of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, (i) violated the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or violated any similar Law; or (ii) made
any unlawful bribe, unlawful kickback or other unlawful payment to any

Subsidiaries, nor, any of their directors, officers, or, to the Knowledge of
Parent their employees, agents, or any other person acting for or on behalf
of Parent or its Subsidiaries is the subject of any current, pending or
threatened investigation, inquiry or enforcement proceedings for violations
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any similar Law

accounting controls or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim from employees of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters with respect to
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, and to the Knowledge of Parent, no
attorney representing Parent or any Subsidiary Parent, whether or not
employed by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, has reported evidence of any
material violation of state or federal banking or securities Laws, breach or
violation of fiduciary duty or similar violation, by Parent, any Subsidiary
of Parent or any of their respective officers, directors, managers, employees
or agents to the Board of Directors of Parent or any committee thereof, or to
the general counsel or chief executive officer of Parent.

  

(c)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent is
not in violation of any of the rules, regulations or requirements of NASDAQ
and has no Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would reasonably be

by the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. During the two years prior to the
date hereof, (i) the Parent Voting Common Stock has been listed or designated
for quotation on NASDAQ; (ii) trading in the Parent Voting Common Stock has

advisor, Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC (the "Parent Financial Advisor"), has

the date of such opinion, the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view,
to the stockholders of Parent. A copy of that opinion has been delivered to
the Company.

    

Section 5.17 _Brokers and Finders_. Parent has not entered into any
Contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person or firm which may
result in the obligation of Parent to pay any investment banking fees,
finder's fees, or brokerage commissions in connection with the transactions

Section 5.19 _Intellectual Property Rights_. Parent and its
Subsidiaries own or possess adequate rights or licenses to use all trademarks,
trade names, service marks, service mark registrations, service names,
patents, patent rights, copyrights, original works, inventions, licenses,
approvals, governmental authorizations, trade secrets and other intellectual
property rights and all applications and registrations therefor (the "Parent
Intellectual Property Rights") necessary to conduct their respective
businesses as now conducted. Parent has no Knowledge of any infringement of
the Parent Intellectual Property Rights by others. There is no claim, action
or proceeding pending, or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries regarding the Parent Intellectual Property
Rights. To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no facts or circumstances which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any of the foregoing
infringements or Proceedings. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have taken
commercially reasonable security measures to protect the secrecy,
confidentiality and value of all material Parent Intellectual Property Rights.

    

Section 5.20 _Off Balance Sheet Arrangements_. There is no transaction,
arrangement, or other relationship between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
and an unconsolidated or other off balance sheet entity that is required to be
disclosed by Parent in its Exchange Act filings and is not so disclosed or
that otherwise would be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

    

Section 5.21 _Manipulation of Price_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no Person acting on their
behalf has, directly or indirectly, (a) taken any action designed to cause or
to result in the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to facilitate the sale or resale of any of
the Parent Voting Common Stock, (b) sold, bid for, purchased, or paid any
compensation for soliciting purchases of, any of the Parent Voting Common
Stock, or (c) paid or agreed to pay to any Person any compensation for
soliciting another to purchase any other securities of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

    

Section 5.22 _No Additional Agreements_. Except with respect to the
Parent Stockholders Agreement, Parent does not have any agreement or
understanding with the Company or its Affiliates or stockholders with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereunder other than as specified in this
Agreement.

    

Section 5.23 _Parent Stock_. At the Closing, Parent shall have
sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Parent Stock to consummate the

insured by insurers of recognized financial responsibility against such losses
and risks and in such amounts as management of Parent believes to be prudent
and customary in the businesses in which the Parent and its Subsidiaries are
engaged. Neither Parent nor any such Subsidiary has since January 1, 2013 been
refused any insurance coverage sought or applied for, and neither Parent nor
any such Subsidiary has any reason to believe that it will be unable to renew
its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to obtain
similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue its
business at a cost that would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.26 _Employee Relations_. Neither Parent nor any of its

under the Securities Act) or other key employee of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries has notified Parent or any such Subsidiary that such officer
intends to leave Parent or any such Subsidiary or otherwise terminate such
officer's employment with Parent or any such Subsidiary. No executive officer
or other key employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is, or is now
expected by Parent to be, in violation of any material term of any employment
contract, confidentiality, disclosure or proprietary information agreement,
non-competition agreement, or any other contract or agreement or any
restrictive covenant, and the continued employment of each such executive
officer or other key employee (as the case may be) will, to the Knowledge of
Parent, not subject Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to any liability with
respect to any of the foregoing matters. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations
respecting labor, employment and employment practices and benefits, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours, except where failure to be in
compliance would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

    

Section 5.27 _Information Supplied_. The information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent in writing expressly for inclusion in the Form S-4 will
not, at the time the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent with
respect to statements made therein based on information supplied by the

representations and warranties contained in this _Article V_ , the Company
acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub nor any other Person on behalf of

or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Sub or with respect to any other
information provided to the Company (other than information provided to the

the Merger at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of
the other Parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file,
as promptly as practicable, all notifications required under the HSR Act and
any applicable international antitrust requirements.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
6.10(c)_ , neither Parent, nor the Company nor any of their Subsidiaries
shall be required to (i) license, divest, dispose of or hold separate any
assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or that would otherwise have a material adverse
effect on the combined company or (ii) pay more than _de minimis_  amounts in
connection with seeking or obtaining such consents, approvals or
authorizations as are required to complete the Merger under applicable
Antitrust Laws (excluding any mandatory filing fees and reasonable and
customary costs and expenses associated with making applications for, and
responding to requests for information from Governmental Entities with respect
to, such required consents, approvals or authorizations).

(d)  Each of Parent and the Company, as applicable, shall give (or
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third
Persons, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third Person consents related
to or required in connection with the Merger that are (i) necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required
to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (iii) required to
prevent a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect
from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time; _provided, however_ ,
that, with respect to this subsection (d), the Company shall not offer or pay
any consideration in excess of $250,000 for all consents, approvals or
waivers in the aggregate, or make any agreement or understanding
affecting the business or the assets, properties or Liabilities of the
Company, in order to obtain any such third Person consents, approvals or
waivers, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If any Party shall fail to
obtain any consent from a third Person described in this subsection (d), such
Party will use its reasonable efforts, and will take any such actions
reasonably requested by the other Party hereto, to limit the adverse
affect upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their
respective businesses resulting, or that would reasonably be expected to
result after the consummation of the Merger, from the failure to obtain such
consent.

  

(e)  Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents,
authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any
Governmental Entity undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
6.10(_ e). In that regard, prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly
consult with the other parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide
any necessary information and assistance as the other parties may reasonably
request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the
other parties (or their counsel) copies of) all notices, submissions, or
filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger. Each party to this
Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement, and if in
writing, furnish the other parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other parties orally of) any communication from or
to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, and permit the other parties
to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other parties in connection with, any proposed communication with any such
Governmental Entity. If any party to this Agreement or any Representative of
such parties receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger,
then such party shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be
made, promptly and after consultation with the other parties to this
Agreement, an appropriate response in substantial compliance with such
request. No party shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Entity where material issues or any matters relating to timing
would likely be discussed in connection with this Agreement and the Merger
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat. In addition, without the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not agree or commit to, or
permit any of its Subsidiaries to agree or commit to, any commitment to sell,
divest or dispose of any businesses, assets, relationships or contractual
rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or purporting to limit the
Company's, any of its Subsidiaries\' or Parent\'s freedom to action with
respect to, or ability to retain, any businesses, assets, relationships
or contractual rights. Without limiting the foregoing, unless prohibited by
Law or the applicable Governmental Entity, each party shall, on a current
basis, furnish the other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between it and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and
the Merger, and furnish the other parties with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of
information to any such Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 6.10(_ e), materials provided pursuant to
this _Section 6.10(_ e) may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company and the Merger or other similarly
confidential information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege
concerns.

Section 6.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent and the Company
shall promptly (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) advise the
other orally and in writing of any state of facts, event, change, effect,
development, condition or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect, respectively. The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or inaccurate in
any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) the failure by
it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

    

Section 6.12 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

    

(a)  The certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation (and the organizational documents of each Subsidiary of
the Company) shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation as are set forth in the Company
Certificate and Company Bylaws as in effect at the date hereof (to the extent
consistent with applicable Law), which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the persons who at any time prior to the Effective Time
were entitled to indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation
under the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws (or the
applicable organizational documents of the Company's Subsidiaries) in respect
of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law (and provided that all rights of
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation in respect of any
claim asserted or made within such six-year period shall continue until the
final disposition of such claim). From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, and cause the
Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries to honor,
the respective covenants of this _Section_  6.12.

  

(b)  From and after the Effective Time and until the expiration of
any applicable statutes of limitation of the underlying claim to which the
indemnification relates, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
present and former officers directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, together with their respective heirs, executors and
administrators, the "Indemnified Directors and Officers") against all losses,
claims, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and including
any attorneys' fees or other fees incurred to enforce the provisions of this
_Section 6.12(_ b)), Liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement of,
or otherwise, in connection with any claim, action, suit, Proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
including all appeals thereof to which any Indemnified Directors and Officers
is or may become a party to by virtue of his or her service as a present or
former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
arising out of actual or alleged events, actions or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, in each case to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

   

73 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(c)  Parent agrees and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
agree, and the Company agrees, that all rights to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses now existing in
favor of any Indemnified Directors and Officers or any current or
former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (together with
their heirs, executors and administrators, and any Indemnified Directors and
Officers, the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Company Certificate or
the Company Bylaws (or the organizational documents of Company's
Subsidiaries) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
agree, and the Surviving Corporation agrees, to maintain in effect the
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws (and the organizational documents of
the Company's Subsidiaries) now in effect and any such indemnification
agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with the
Indemnified Parties and not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
such Indemnified Parties, and all such rights in respect of any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation pending or asserted or claim made or threatened
within such period shall continue until the final disposition or resolution
thereof.

  

(d)  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time with respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance in an
amount and scope reasonably comparable to the existing policy of the Company
and reasonably acceptable to Parent for claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time at a cost that is reasonable
and customary for tail insurance policies with its existing directors' and
officers' liability policy insurer or an insurer with a comparable insurer
financial strength rating as Parent's existing directors' and officers'
liability policy insurer (the "DandO Insurance"). The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain competitive quotes (from insurance
providers with comparable ratings) for such insurance coverage in an effort
to reduce the cost thereof and shall use Lockton Companies in obtaining such
insurance coverage. The cost of the DandO Insurance shall not exceed 200% of the
Company's current annual premium, with credit given for any unearned premium
remaining on the current policy. The parties agree that if a claim has
been made against the Company's current DandO policy prior to the Closing, a
new aggregate limit of liability shall be negotiated in connection with the
DandO Insurance.

  

(e)  The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified
Party may have under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company and any of the Company's Subsidiaries
or under any other indemnification agreements or under applicable Law. The
obligations under this _Section_ 6.12 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to affect adversely any Indemnified Party to whom this
_Section_ 6.12 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this
_Section_ 6.12 applies and their respective heirs, successors and assigns
shall be express third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ 6.12). This
_Section_ 6.12 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended
to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties
referred to herein.

  

(f)  If the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ 6.12.

Section 6.13 _No Solicitation_.

    

(a)   _Company Takeover Proposal_.

  

(i)  The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any
Subsidiary of the Company to, nor shall it authorize or permit any Company
Representative to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage the submission, making or announcement of any Company Takeover
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
the making of, any inquiry or any proposal that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii)
make or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in respect of
any Company Takeover Proposal (in each case, except as permitted by this
_Section_ 6.13).

  

(ii)  The Company shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary of the
Company and each Company Representative to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all discussions or negotiations with any person conducted
heretofore with respect to any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and
shall cause each Subsidiary of the Company to, enforce (and not waive any
provision of or release any Person from any obligations under) any
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party unless the Company Board concludes in
good faith that a failure to take any action described in this sentence would
be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law.

  

(iii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time after the date
hereof and prior to the time that the Required Company Stockholder Vote has
been obtained, the Company receives a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal that
did not result from a breach or a deemed breach (pursuant to _Section
6.13(a)(_ iv) _)_ by the Company or any Company Representative of _Section
6.13(a)(i) and/or (ii)_ , or the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company
otherwise has complied with _Sections 6.13(a)(i) and (ii)_ , and the Company
Board determines in good faith (A) after consultation with outside counsel and
an independent financial advisor that such Company Takeover Proposal is, or
is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Company Proposal and (B) after
consultation with outside counsel that failure to take the actions set forth
in clauses (1) and (2) below with respect to such Company Takeover Proposal
would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Law, the Company may, subject to
providing prior written notice of its decision to take such action to Parent
and compliance with  _Section 6.13(c)_ : (1) furnish information with respect
to the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Company Takeover Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement no less
restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement (but which
confidentiality agreement may allow such Person to make any Company Takeover
Proposal to the Company in connection with the negotiations and discussions
permitted by this _Section 6.13_ ), provided that all such information not
previously provided to Parent is promptly provided to Parent and (2)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Company Takeover Proposal regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.

  

(iv)  The parties hereto acknowledge that any violation by any
Subsidiary of the Company or any Company Representative of any provision of
this _Section 6.13_ shall be deemed to be a violation by the Company.

  

(b)   _Change in Recommendation_.

  

(i)  Neither the Company nor the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (A) (1) withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent) or propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent), the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any such
committee of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (2) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal (either (1) or (2) being
a "Change in Recommendation") or (B) approve, or cause or permit the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company to enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement relating to any Company Takeover Proposal (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement").

(ii)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time after the date
hereof and prior to the time that the Required Company Stockholder Vote has
been obtained, (x) the Company receives a Superior Company Proposal that did
not result from a breach or a deemed breach (pursuant to _Section
6.13(a)(iv))_ by the Company or any Company Representative of _Section
6.13(a)(i)_  and/or _Section 6.13(a)(ii)_ , or the Confidentiality Agreement,
and (y) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel that, in light of such proposal, a failure to make a Change in
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary
duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law, the Company may,
(A) make a Change in Recommendation or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1_ (f), so long as (and only if) (i) the Company has complied
with this _Section 6.13_ , including subsection (c) below, (ii) the Company
Board shall have first provided a Superior Proposal Notice to Parent, (iii)
either (x) within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such
Superior Proposal Notice (the "Proposal Period"), Parent shall not have
proposed (in writing and in a manner what would be binding on Parent if
accepted by the Company) any adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or (y) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor, that any such proposal by
Parent during the Proposal Period does not cause the Superior Company
Proposal to cease to constitute a Superior Company Proposal, and (iv)
concurrently with and as a condition to such termination, the Company Board
causes the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with such Person
with respect to such Superior Company Proposal and to pay the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_. The Company agrees that, during
the Proposal Period, the Company and the Company Representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent and the Parent Representatives regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that are proposed by Parent. A "Superior Proposal Notice" means a written
notice to Parent from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board is
prepared to make a Change in Recommendation or accept a Superior
Company Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior
Company Proposal, attaching the most current draft of the Superior Company
Proposal and identifying the Person making such Superior Company Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the price or any
other material term of such Superior Company Proposal shall require a new
Superior Proposal Notice and a new Proposal Period, as provided above.

  

(iii)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Vote, the Company Board
may make a Change in Recommendation (except for a Change in Recommendation
with respect to a Superior Proposal to which _Section 6.13(b)(ii)_ applies),
if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company's outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company directors' fiduciary duties to the Company
stockholders under applicable Law.

  

(c)   _Company Takeover Proposal Information_.

  

(i)  The Company shall promptly, but in any event within forty-
eight (48) hours, (i) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Company
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to or contemplates, any Company Takeover Proposal (including
any change to the terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry),
specifying the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the
Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide
to Parent a copy of all written material provided to the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or any Company Representative in connection with
any such Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to or contemplates, any Company Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall (A) keep Parent fully informed of the status of
any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry, and (B) promptly, but in any
event within forty-eight (48) hours, advise Parent orally and in writing of
any material amendments to the terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or
inquiry and shall provide to Parent a copy of all written materials provided
to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or any Company Representative
in connection with any such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall not
take any actions whether contractually or otherwise to limit its ability to
comply with its obligations hereunder.

(ii)  The Company shall provide Parent with at least forty-eight
(48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the
members of the Company Board) of any meeting of the Company Board at which the
Company Board is expected to consider any Company Takeover Proposal or any
such inquiry or to consider providing information to any person or group in
connection with a Company Takeover Proposal or any such inquiry.

  

Section 6.14 _Tax Free Reorganization_.

    

(a)  Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of Parent, the Company,
or their respective Subsidiaries shall take, or agree to take, fail to take,
or agree to fail to take, any action (including any action otherwise
permitted by _Section_ 6.1 in the case of the Company) that would reasonably
be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Pursuant to
the foregoing, each Party agrees to make such commercially reasonable
additions or modifications to the terms of this Agreement as may be
reasonably necessary to permit the Merger to so qualify.

Merger Sub and the Company (i) shall report the Merger as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) shall not take any

shall properly file with their federal income Tax Returns all information
required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3.

  

(c)  The Parties hereto shall cooperate and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent's and the Company's Tax counsel and
Tax advisors a certificate containing representations reasonably requested by
such counsel and/or advisors in connection with the rendering of the Tax
opinions to be issued by such counsel and/or advisors with respect to the
treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code as required under _Section 7.2(f)_ and _7.3(d)_ and in
connection with the filing of the Registration Statement. Parent's and the
Company's Tax counsel and Tax advisors shall be entitled to rely upon such
representations in rendering any such opinions.

  

(d)  The certificates required pursuant to _Section 6.14(c)_ and the
tax opinions required pursuant to _Section 7.2(e)_ and _Section 7.3(d)_ will
be in a form and content that is reasonably acceptable to both Parent and the
Company.

threatened or asserted in writing, brought or commenced against such Party or
any of such Party's Subsidiaries, that would have been disclosed pursuant to
_Article_ IV or _Article_ V, as the case may be, if such Proceeding had arisen
prior to the date hereof. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or make
an offer to settle any litigation commenced against the Company or any
director by any stockholder relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated hereby, unless Parent shall have consented in
writing to such payment or settlement (with such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld).

"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other anti-takeover statute or
regulation ("Takeover Law") is or may become applicable to this Agreement, the

other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and the Company
Board, Parent and the Parent Board shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as

soon as practicable following the Effective Time, file a registration

assumed Company Stock Options held by non-employees of the Company (the "Non-
Employee Options") shall not be registered by Parent on Form S-8 and (ii) the

obtain endorsements naming Parent and Merger Sub as additional insureds, for a
period of five (5) years following the Effective Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that if such pollution liability insurance is unavailable on a commercially

reasonable terms (the "Pollution Liability Insurance").

the time periods mandated by the DGCL from holders of Company Shares
representing more than one percent (1%) of the issued and outstanding Company

on any site of the Company's Facilities disclosed to Parent in the Dataroom on

been satisfied if Parent has not provided notice to the Company within 30 days

commissioned by Parent as of the date hereof, that the cost of remediation of
the Company's Facilities would in the reasonable determination of Parent be
expected to exceed $3,300,000 in the aggregate (the "Remediation Notice"). If

affecting the satisfaction of the foregoing condition to Closing, the Parties
will negotiate in good faith to develop a remediation plan that is mutually
acceptable to the Parties.

  

(l)   _BNSF_. Parent shall not have become aware of information
that would reasonably be understood to indicate that the BNSF does not intend
to establish a rail track connecting the rail facilities of NELLC to the inner
rail loop belonging to the Aurora West Facility along with the associated

owned by NELLC or Aventine Renewable Energy - Aurora West, LLC such that the

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (except to
the extent such representations and warranties are expressly made as of a

opinion of its counsel, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, on the basis of facts,
representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion and dated the

available at law or in equity.

    

Section 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement and all exhibits and attachments hereto, including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Stockholders Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and

Section 9.7 _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement
or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other parties, except that Parent may assign or pledge
as collateral this Agreement or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to
an affiliate of Parent or to any financing sources. Any purported assignment

Sub, but, after any such approval if any such amendment or waiver shall by
applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of NASDAQ
require further approval of the Company stockholders, the effectiveness of
such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the Company
stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that no modification or amendment of
this Agreement or of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid or
enforceable unless in writing duly executed by each of the Parties hereto.

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure of any Party to exercise
any power given such Party hereunder or to insist upon strict compliance by
any party with its obligations hereunder, and no custom or practice of the
parties in variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of that
Party's right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof. Any waiver
shall not obligate that Party to agree to any further or subsequent waiver or
affect the validity of the provision relating to any such waiver.

    

Section 9.10 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties hereto. The
Parties further agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such void or

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has
an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in
the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if (and only if) the Court of Chancery
does not accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with
regard to any such action or Proceeding for itself and in respect of its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the
Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or Proceeding
with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason, (ii) any
claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any
such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit,
action or Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B)
the venue of such suit, action or Proceeding is improper or (C) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service
of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in _Section_ 9.2 shall be effective service of
process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 9.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES

ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED BY THE PARTIES IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _Section_ 9.14.

    

Section 9.15 _Disclosure_. Any matter disclosed in any Section of a
Party's Disclosure Schedule shall be considered disclosed for other sections
of such Disclosure Schedule, but only to the extent such matter on its face
would reasonably be expected to be pertinent to a particular Section of a
Party's Disclosure Schedule in light of the disclosure made in such section.
The provision of monetary or other quantitative thresholds for disclosure does
not and shall not be deemed to create or imply a standard of materiality
hereunder.
