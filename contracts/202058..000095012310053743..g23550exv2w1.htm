Each share of Company Stock and each Warrant issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall cease to be issued and outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired, shall cease to exist and shall automatically be converted only into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the amount to which the holder of such share or Warrant would have been entitled to receive if, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company were liquidated and an amount equal to the aggregate sum of (i) the Merger Consideration, as determined pursuant to this  _Article II_ and as adjusted hereunder, and (ii) the aggregate exercise price that would have been payable if all of the issued and outstanding Warrants were exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming the Merger is the Exit (as defined in the Warrant)), were distributed to the holders of such Company Stock and Warrants pursuant to such liquidation (treating holders of such Warrants as if such Warrants had been exercised immediately prior to such liquidation) determined in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter and the Stockholders Agreement as in effect at such time less, in the case of any Warrant, the aggregate exercise price payable upon the exercise of such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, with respect to any such share of Company Stock or Warrant, the " _Applicable Share Amount_ "), subject to the Applicable Reductions. From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock and Warrants issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) and any certificates previously evidencing them shall represent only the right to receive, as determined pursuant to Article II and as adjusted hereunder the Applicable Share Amount therefor, subject to the Applicable Reductions, payable in accordance with and subject to this _Article II_, and the record holders of such shares and Warrants (the " _Company Holders_ ") shall cease to have any other rights with respect to such shares or Warrants (or the shares of Company Stock underlying Warrants) except as expressly provided in this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, any vesting conditions or repurchase rights applicable to any shares of Company Stock (each such share, a share of " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") granted to any Employee, Contractor or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, shall lapse and such shares of Company Restricted Stock shall be fully vested and shall be treated the same as all other shares of Company Stock in accordance with  _Section 2.2(a)_ of this Agreement, subject to the Applicable Reductions. 

  

 (c) _Treasury Stock_. Any Equity Securities of the Company held in the treasury or otherwise beneficially owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time and any Equity Securities of the Company other than the Company Stock and Warrants (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall cease to be issued and, if applicable, outstanding, shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment of any cash or other property or consideration therefor and shall cease to exist. 

  

 (d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and as to which the holders thereof have properly perfected a demand for appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and have not effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such right (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted as provided in this Article II into the right to receive the Applicable Share Amounts with respect to such Dissenting Shares (subject to the Applicable Reductions), and such holders shall instead be entitled to only such rights and payments as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any such stockholder of the Company shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholders Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time as provided in this Article II into the right to receive such Applicable Share Amounts (subject to the Applicable Reductions) and such stockholder shall cease to have any other rights with respect thereto. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written notices received by the Company with respect to any intent to demand, or demands for, appraisal with respect to any shares of Company Stock, attempts to withdraw such notices or demands and any other instruments or notices served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or applicable Law relating to stockholders appraisal rights and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an Order of a court of competent jurisdiction, make any payment or other commitment with respect to any such demands for appraisal rights, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. 

  

 SECTION 2.3. Calculation of Merger Consideration. 

  

 (a) No earlier than ten Business Days nor less than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Estimate Statement_ ") setting forth the Companys good faith estimates of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness, the Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, the Closing Cash and the Closing Taxes, and a calculation of the Merger Consideration (the " _Estimated Merger Consideration_ ") based on the foregoing estimates. The Estimate Statement shall also include the Companys good faith initial determination of the Applicable Share Amount for each class and series of Company Stock and each Warrant based on the Estimated Merger Consideration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) No later than the 90th day after the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Deadline_ "), Parent will prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Adjustment Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), together with a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Parents determination of (i) the actual Closing Working Capital, (ii) the actual Closing Indebtedness, (iii) the actual Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, (iv) the actual Closing Cash, (v) the actual Closing Taxes and (vi) a calculation of the Merger Consideration, in each case prepared in accordance with  _Section 2.3(f)_. If Parent fails to deliver the Closing Statement by the Post-Closing Deadline, then the Merger Consideration shall not be further adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ unless the Stockholder Representative elects, by written notice delivered to Parent within five Business Days after the Post-Closing Deadline, to retain (at the expense of Parent and the Surviving Corporation) a nationally recognized independent accounting firm to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_, in which case such independent accounting firm shall be instructed to deliver the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement to the Stockholder Representative and Parent within 60 days after the Post-Closing Deadline and the determinations of such accounting firm will be conclusive and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Stockholder Representative, the Company Holders and each of their Affiliates (the " _Interested Persons_ "). Parent shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to make their financial records available to the Stockholder Representative and its advisors (or such independent accounting firm retained by the Stockholder Representative, as the case may be) in connection with any review conducted in connection with this _Section 2.3_. 

  

 (c) During the 60-day period immediately following the day on which the Stockholder Representative receives the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, the Stockholder Representative and its representatives and advisors (i) will be permitted to review, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, the Surviving Corporations and the Company Subsidiaries books and records and the working papers related to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein), and (ii) will be given reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to knowledgeable employees and accounting professionals of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries in order to facilitate the Stockholder Representatives review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the review and access described in clauses (i) and (ii) will be conducted at times and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the operation of Parents, the Surviving Corporations or the Company Subsidiaries respective businesses. The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein) will become final, binding and conclusive upon the Interested Persons on the earlier of (A) the 60th day following the date on which the Stockholder Representative receives them unless Parent receives from the Stockholder Representative prior to such 60th day a written notice from the Stockholder Representative setting forth all of its disagreements with any account or determination in the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement (the " _Disputed Items_ ") together with an explanation for each Disputed Item in reasonable detail and its proposed adjustments with respect to each Disputed Item to the extent reasonably practicable in light of the information then available to the 

   ##### 

  

   

Stockholder Representative (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") and (B) the date on
which the Stockholder Representative notifies Parent in writing that it does
not dispute the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing if the Stockholder
Representative is entitled and elects to retain an independent accounting firm
pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ then the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement (including the determinations included therein) prepared by such
independent accounting firm will become final, binding and conclusive upon
the Interested Persons when delivered to the Stockholder Representative and
Parent. If a Dispute Notice is given, then any item set forth or reflected on
the Closing Balance Sheet or the Closing Statement that is not a Disputed
Item will be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon the Interested Persons
from and after the delivery of the Dispute Notice. If the Stockholder
Representative timely delivers the Dispute Notice, then the Closing Balance
Sheet and Closing Statement (including the determinations included therein)
will become final, binding and conclusive upon the Interested Persons on the
first to occur of (x) the date on which Parent and the Stockholder
Representative agree in writing with respect to the resolution of all
the Disputed Items or (y) the first date on which all of the Disputed Items
are resolved by the written agreement of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative or finally resolved in writing by the Independent Accountants
in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_. 

  

 (d) During the 30 days after the date on which Parent receives the Dispute Notice, Parent and the Stockholder Representative will seek in good faith to resolve by written agreement any differences they have with respect to the Disputed Items and any Disputed Item so resolved will be deemed final, binding and conclusive upon the Interested Persons. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative do not reach written agreement on the resolution of all of the Disputed Items during such 30-day period (or such longer period as they shall mutually agree), then at the end of such 30-day (or longer) period Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall submit all unresolved Disputed Items (collectively, the " _Unresolved Items_ ") to Deloitte and Touche LLP or such other nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants with a nationwide audit and accounting practice as Parent and the Stockholder Representative may agree in writing (the " _Independent Accountants_ ") and the Independent Accountants shall review and resolve all of the Unresolved Items. The Independent Accountants will determine each Unresolved Item in accordance with this _Section 2.3(d)_ and _Section 2.3(f)_ as promptly as may be reasonably practicable, and Parent and the Stockholder Representative will instruct the Independent Accountants to endeavor to complete such process within a period of no more than 60 days; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing if any such determination of any Unresolved Item is more favorable to Parent than the related amount specified by the Parent in the Closing Statement, or more favorable to the Company Holders than any related amount specified by the Stockholder Representative in the Dispute Notice, then such Unresolved Item shall be deemed to be such related amount specified by Parent or the Stockholder Representative, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement. The Independent Accountants shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to resolve each Unresolved Item based solely on the provisions of this Agreement, GAAP and the written presentations made by Parent and the Stockholder Representative and their respective agents, and not by independent review. Except as Parent and the Stockholder Representative may otherwise agree in writing, all communications between Parent and the Stockholder Representative or any of their respective representatives, on the one hand, and the Independent Accountants, on the other hand, will be in writing, with copies simultaneously delivered to the non-communicating party. The Independent Accountants determination of the Unresolved Items will be final, 

   ##### 

  

   

binding and conclusive on the Interested Parties, effective as of the date
the Independent Accountants written determination is received by Parent and
the Stockholder Representative. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountants will be borne one-half by Parent and one-half by the Stockholder
Representative, and each of Parent and the Stockholder Representative will
bear its own legal, accounting and other fees and expenses of participating
in such dispute resolution procedure. 

  

 (e) Upon final determination of the Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Cash and Closing Taxes pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_,  _(c)_ or _(d)_ , as applicable, an adjustment will be determined and paid as follows: 

   

 (i) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Merger Consideration (based on such final determination), the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall within five (5) Business Days after such final determination issue joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent the amount of such excess together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the payment date at the rate of 2% per annum (collectively, the " _Excess Amount_ ") out of the Adjustment Escrow by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by Parent (the " _Parent Account_ "), and to pay to the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders) the remaining amount, if any, of the Adjustment Escrow , by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Stockholder Representative. If the Excess Amount is greater than the amount in the Adjustment Escrow, then the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall issue joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent out of the Indemnity Escrow the amount by which the Excess Amount exceeds the amount in the Adjustment Escrow (up to the amount in the Indemnity Escrow) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Parent Account. Any amount payable to Parent pursuant to this  _Section 2.3(e)(i)_ will be paid within five (5) Business Days of such final determination by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by Parent. 

   

 (ii) If the Merger Consideration (based on such final determination) exceeds the Estimated Merger Consideration, Parent will pay to the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders) an amount equal to such excess together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the payment date at the rate of 2% per annum, and the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay the amount of the Adjustment Escrow to the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Holders). Any amount payable to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to this  _Section 2.3(e)(ii)_ will be paid within five (5) Business Days of such final determination by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Stockholder Representative. 

  

Any amount paid to Parent pursuant to clause (e)(i) or to the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to clause (e)(ii) (other than interest on the
Adjustment Escrow paid to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to clause
(ii) above) will be deemed to constitute an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration.

 (f) For the purposes of this _Section 2.3_, each accounting term used herein will have the meaning that is applied thereto in accordance with GAAP as of the date of this Agreement and, to the extent consistent with such GAAP, the accounting principles, policies, procedures and methodologies applied in preparing the Audited Financial Statements as of, and for the year ending on, the Balance Sheet Date.

have been entitled thereto for all  purposes of this Agreement. The
Stockholder Representative shall pay the Applicable Share Amounts, less the
Applicable Reductions, to each Company Holder promptly following the
Effective Time or, in the case of any Non-Signatory Holder, the delivery of
its Certificates and the related Letter of Transmittal as required by

 SECTION 3.4. Authority. 

  

 The Company has the necessary corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been approved and declared advisable by the unanimous vote of the Board of Directors of the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company or its shareholders are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby except for the execution and delivery by Parent of the Written Consents pursuant to the irrevocable proxies granted pursuant to _Section 7.11_. A majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company who have not been designated by ABRY Partners V, L.P. (" _ABRY V_ ") have approved all consideration, fees or others benefits paid or provided to, or to be paid or provided to, any "Approving Stockholder" (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) or any Affiliate of an Approving Stockholder in connection with the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby that are required to be so approved by Section 4(d) of the Stockholders Agreement.

Upon such execution and delivery, the Merger will constitute an "Approved Sale" (as defined the Stockholders Agreement) for all purposes of the Stockholders Agreement.

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming its due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by the application of general principles of equity.

any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets is bound,
except, in the case of this clause (iii) only, for any such violations,

The foregoing grant of each such proxy to Parent is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated or affected by any subsequent act, death, disability or incapacity of any Major Stockholder, by operation of Law or by any other event. In addition, each Major Stockholder and Company Holder hereby irrevocably agrees (i) to the treatment of the Merger as an Approved Sale (as defined in the Shareholders Agreement) and a notional liquidation of the Company under the Company Charter, the payment of expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative as set forth herein and the provisions of, and method of determination, reduction, allocation, payment and post-Closing adjustment of the Merger Consideration (including, without limitation, _Section 2.3(e)(i)_ ) provided for in, _Articles II_ and _IX_ both generally and with respect to such Equity Securities and (ii) that after Parent or Merger Sub shall have made the payments to the Stockholder Representative described in _Section 2.5(a)_ and the deposits required by  _Section 2.5(b)(i)_, other than as expressly set forth in _Section 7.5_ or _9.2_ , such Major Stockholder or Company Holder shall have no further claims or causes of actions, in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to the Merger Consideration or its Applicable Share Amount or otherwise under this Agreement against Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (regardless of whether or not the Stockholder Representative complies with its obligations hereunder or under any other Contract) and hereby irrevocably waives any and all such claims and causes of actions and any rights it has under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Equity Securities of the Company. Each Company Holder represents and warrants that immediately prior to the Effective Time it will be the sole record and beneficial owner of, and 

   ##### 

  

    

will have good and marketable title to, the number and type of Equity
Securities of the Company set forth opposite its name in _Schedule 3.3_ or
in its Joinder Agreement free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
Encumbrances that secure the Company Credit Documents or that arise
under applicable securities Laws and agrees to deliver Certificates
representing such Equity Securities to Parent at the Closing. ABRY Fund V
L.P. represents and warrants that it is the "ultimate parent entity" (as
defined in the rules promulgated under the HSR Act) of the Company and agrees
to take the actions required to be taken by the Stockholder Representative
and its Affiliates under Section 7.3(c). Each Major Stockholder and Company
Holder represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as of the Date of

Date that: (i) it has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement (or such Joinder Agreement) and to perform its obligations under

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by the
application of general principles of equity.

ARTICLE IX 

   

INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 SECTION 9.1. Indemnification of Parent. 

  

 (a) The Company Holders agree that, after the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company and their respective Affiliates and any officers, directors, employees or agents thereof (each a " _Buyer Indemnified Person_ "), but only to the extent of funds on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow shall, to the extent provided in this _Article IX_, be indemnified and held harmless from and against, any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of actions, losses, costs, damages, penalties, assessments, liabilities and out-of-pocket expenses incurred or paid, including reasonable attorneys fees, costs of investigation or settlement, other professionals and experts fees, and court or arbitration costs but specifically excluding, other than in the case of a Third-Party Claim, consequential damages or punitive and exemplary damages 

   ##### 

  

    

(hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Damages_ "), to the extent such
Damages are determined by a Final Award, a final order of a court of
competent jurisdiction or written agreement of Parent and the Stockholder
Representative to have arisen out of or to have resulted from, in connection
with, or by virtue of (i) facts or circumstances which constitute an
inaccuracy (in the case of any such representation or warranty, as of the
date of this Agreement or such earlier specified date as of which such
representation or warranty was expressly made (each, an " _Earlier Date
Representation_ ") or, except for any Earlier Date Representation, as of and
as if made on the Closing Date), misrepresentation, false certification,
breach of, default in, or failure to perform, any of the representations,
warranties or covenants given or made by the Company in this Agreement or in
the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_, as qualified by
the Company Disclosure Schedules hereto (collectively, the "
_Company Breaches_ "), (ii) any Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expense or
Closing Taxes to the extent it is not actually reflected in the Closing
Indebtedness, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses or Closing Taxes used to
determine the Merger Consideration, (iii) the matters set forth on  _Schedule
9.1(a)_ (the " _Special Indemnified Matters_ ") or (iv) any claim made by
any Non-Signatory Holders with respect to the Merger (including the treatment
of the Merger as an Approved Sale, and a liquidation of the Company under the
Company Charter), the Company Charter, this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, the payment of expenses incurred by the
Stockholder Representative as set forth herein, the provisions of, and method
of determination, reduction, allocation, payment and post-Closing adjustment
of the Merger Consideration provided for in _Articles II_ and _IX_ both
generally and with respect to such Equity Securities and any claims and
causes of actions and any rights it has under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Non-Joinder Indemnified Matters_ " and, collectively with the other matters
for which indemnification is provided in this _Section 9.1(a)_, the "
_Company Indemnified Matters_ "). For purposes of determining whether there
has been any Company Breach in respect of any representation or warranty
(other than with respect to any Qualified Representation), and for purposes
of calculating the amount of Damages to which an Indemnitee is entitled as a
result of any such Company Breach, such representation or warranty shall not
be deemed qualified or limited by any concept of "material," "materiality,"
"Company Material Adverse Effect" or other similar materiality qualification
or limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, no Buyer Indemnified Person will
be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ for any amount
of Damages to the extent such amount is actually reflected in the Closing
Indebtedness, Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses or Closing Working Capital
used to determine the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) Any Claim for indemnification made by a Buyer Indemnified Person under this _Section 9.1_ must be raised in a Notice of Claim pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_ no later than the Release Date and, if so raised by such date, such Claim shall survive the Release Date until final resolution thereof. 

  

 (c) After the Effective Time, except as provided in _Section 9.7_ in respect of fraud, (i) the aggregate liability on account of Company Indemnified Matters pursuant to _Section 9.1_ shall be limited to the funds on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow, and claims by the Buyer Indemnified Persons for Damages under this _Article IX_ in respect of Company Indemnified Matters shall be satisfied solely from and to the extent of funds on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow and (ii) the aggregate liability on account of the Non-Joinder Indemnity Matters pursuant to  _Section 9.1_ shall be limited to $5,000,000, and claims by the Buyer Indemnified Persons for Damages under this _Article IX_ in respect of the Non-Joinder Indemnity Matters shall be satisfied solely from and to the extent of funds on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow.

   ##### 

  

    

 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 9.1_, the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 9.1_ with respect to Company
Breaches of representations and warranties (other than those set forth in
_Sections_ _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.18_ and  _3.23_ and in the certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ to the extent related thereto)
shall not apply with respect to such Company Breaches unless and until
the aggregate Damages from such Company Breaches so determined to be due for
which the Buyer Indemnified Persons seek or have sought indemnification
hereunder exceeds a cumulative aggregate of $2,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in
which event the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall, subject to the other
limitations herein, be indemnified for all such Damages from such Company
Breaches in excess of the Basket. 

  

 (d) The amount to which a Buyer Indemnified Person may become entitled under this _Article IX_ shall be net of any actual recovery (whether by way of payment, discount or credit received from a third party (including any insurer) less any cost associated with receiving such recovery in respect of a claim but, without limiting _Section 9.1(e)_, Buyer Indemnified Person shall not be required to seek or collect such recoveries prior to being entitled to indemnification hereunder but if any indemnity is paid before the Buyer Indemnified Person receives any such recovery then the Buyer Indemnified Person will promptly remit to the Stockholder Representative the portion of the indemnity to which it would not have been entitled if it had received such recovery prior to the payment of such indemnity. 

  

 (e) Each Buyer Indemnified Person shall be responsible for taking or causing to be taken commercially reasonable steps, as it may determine, to mitigate its Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages that may be indemnifiable under this _Section 9.1_. 

  

 (f) In connection with the matters covered by this _Article IX_, no Company Holder shall have (a) any right to indemnity or contribution from the Company or the Surviving Corporation, or (b) any right of subrogation against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any indemnification of a Buyer Indemnified Person by reason of any Company Indemnified Matter, it being agreed and acknowledged that the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company herein are solely for the benefit of Parent and the Merger Sub. 

  

 SECTION 9.2. Indemnification of Company Holders. 

  

 Parent agrees that, after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company Holders (the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and all Damages arising out of or resulting from any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 8.3(d)(ii)_. Each Seller Indemnified Party shall be responsible for taking or causing to be taken commercially reasonable steps, as it may determine, to mitigate its Damages upon and after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to Damages that may be indemnifiable under this _Section 9.2 _. Any payments made pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_ or shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for tax purposes. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 9.3. Notice of Claim. 

  

 (a) As used herein, the term " _Claim_ " means a claim for indemnification by any Buyer Indemnified Person or any Seller Indemnified Person (acting solely through the Stockholder Representative), as the case may be, for Damages under this _Article IX_ (such Person making a Claim, an " _Indemnitee_ "). An Indemnitee may give notice of a Claim under this Agreement, whether for its own Damages or for Damages incurred by any other Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, pursuant to written notice of such Claim executed by an officer of Parent (in the case of a Claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person) or the Stockholder Representative (in the case of a Claim by a Seller Indemnified Person) (a " _Notice of Claim_ "), and delivered to the other of them (such receiving party, the " _Indemnitor_ "), after such Indemnitee becomes aware of the existence of any potential claim by such Indemnitee for indemnification under this _Article IX_, but in any event before the Release Date, arising out of or resulting from: 

   

 (i) any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Section 9.1_ or _9.2_ ; or 

   

 (ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against any Indemnitee of a claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding brought by a third party against any Indemnitee (in each such case, a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that arises out of or results from any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Section 9.1_ or  _9.2_. 

  

 (b) Each Notice of Claim by an Indemnitee shall: 

   

 (i) state that the Indemnitee has incurred or paid or, in good faith, believes it will have to incur or pay, Damages in an aggregate stated amount (to the extent it is practicable to provide such an estimate) arising from such Claim (which amount may be the amount of damages claimed by a third party in an action brought against any Indemnitee based on alleged facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for Damages to such Indemnitee under this _Article IX_); and 

   

 (ii) contain a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably available to the Indemnitee), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged Damages based on the Indemnitees good faith belief thereof, including the identity and address of any third-party claimant (to the extent reasonably available to the Indemnitee). Following delivery of the Notice of Claim (or at the same time if the Indemnitee so elects) the Indemnitee shall deliver copies of any demand or complaint, it shall receive from any third party and, reasonably promptly after such information becomes available to it, the amount of Damages, the date each such item was incurred or paid, the basis for such anticipated liability, and the specific nature of the breach to which such item is related. 

  

 SECTION 9.4. Defense of Third-Party Claims. 

  

 (a) Subject to the provisions hereof, the Indemnitor on behalf of the Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to elect to defend any Third-Party Claim, and, as provided by  _Section 9.5_, the costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnitor in connection with such defense (including attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be paid by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitee may participate, through counsel of its own choice and, except as provided below, at its own expense, in the defense of any Third-Party Claim. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The Indemnitee shall give prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim to the Indemnitor; _provided_ that, so long as such notice is given on or prior to the Release Date, the failure to timely give the Notice of Claim shall not limit or reduce the Indemnitees right to indemnity hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnitor (or the Company Holders, in the case of a Notice of Claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person) is prejudiced thereby. The Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof, including to settle such Third-Party Claim subject to the requirements of _Section 9.4(d)_, utilizing legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee; _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnitee if (A) the Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation or any matters other than a Company Breach, (B) the Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnitee (or against any Company Subsidiary or any other Affiliate of Indemnitee, if the Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Person), (C) the Indemnitor failed or is failing to diligently defend such Third-Party Claim, (D) if the Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnified Person, the Third-Party Claim or the litigation or resolution thereof involves an issue or matter which is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets, properties or prospects of the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or (E) the Third-Party Claim could reasonably give rise to Damages against any Buyer Indemnified Persons hereunder that would exceed, after considering all other outstanding Claims hereunder, the balance of the funds then on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow. If the foregoing proviso applies to any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense, of such Third-Party Claim at its sole cost and expense. 

  

 (c) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to defend any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall: (i) notify Indemnitee within 15 days of receipt of the Notice of Claim that it will defend such Third-Party Claim; (ii) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence and act affirmatively to keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed of material developments in the Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof; (iii) promptly submit to the Indemnitee copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and other similar legal documents and papers received or filed in connection therewith; (iv) promptly respond to all reasonable requests by Indemnitee relating thereto and otherwise permit the Indemnitee and its counsel to participate in, but not control, the conduct of the defense thereof; and (v) to the extent practicable in the circumstances permit the Indemnitee and its counsel an opportunity to review and comment upon all legal papers to be submitted prior to their submission. Parent and the Stockholder Representative will make available to each other and each others counsel and accountants, without charge, all of its or their books and records relating to the Third-Party Claim, and each party will render to the other party such assistance as may be reasonably required in order to insure the proper and adequate defense thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the other party in connection therewith. The Indemnitor and the Indemnitee shall use reasonable best efforts to avoid production of confidential 

   ##### 

  

    

information (consistent with applicable Law and subject a partys right to
waive its own privilege), and seek to cause all communications among
employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim
to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product
privileges. Once the Indemnitor has made the election to defend as set forth
above, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in any such defense
and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at its sole cost and expense;
_provided_ , that if the Indemnitee shall have been advised by counsel in
writing that there are legal defenses available to the Indemnitee that are
not available to, or in conflict with, those of the Indemnitor the expenses
of such counsel shall be considered Damages. The assumption of the defense of
any such Third-Party Claim by the Indemnitor shall be an acknowledgement of
the obligation of the Indemnitor to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to
such claim hereunder. If the Indemnitor fails or refuses to provide the
defense notice within 15 days after receipt of a Notice of Claim, the
Indemnitee shall have the sole and exclusive right to undertake the defense,
compromise and settlement of such Claim with counsel of its own choosing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such compromise or settlement shall be
binding on the issue of whether, or the extent to which, the Indemnitee may
be entitled to indemnification hereunder. 

  

 (d) If the Indemnitor has the right to and does elect to defend any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not have the right to enter into any settlement of a Third-Party Claim on the Indemnitees behalf without the consent of the Indemnitee unless (i) in the case of a Claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person, the amount to be paid by the Indemnitee as a result of such settlement does not exceed the balance of the funds then on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow (after taking into account any other outstanding Claims) from which such Claim shall be paid, (ii) such settlement does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of law or any injunctive or other form of non-monetary relief binding upon the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, officers, directors and agents other than reasonable confidentiality obligations related to the terms of such settlement, and (iii) such settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnitee and its Affiliates and such other Persons from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim, and includes the giving by the claimant to the Indemnitee of a release in respect thereof, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, of any further liability, at law, in equity or otherwise.

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) the Seller Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to participate at their expense in the defense of any claim for Taxes for any Tax year or period ending after the Closing Date which may be the subject of indemnification by the Seller Indemnified Persons pursuant to Section 9.1(a) and, with the written consent of the Buyer Indemnified Persons, and at their sole expense, may assume the entire defense of such Tax claim. 

  

 SECTION 9.5. Resolution of Notice of Claim. 

  

 Each Notice of Claim given by an Indemnitee shall be resolved as follows: 

  

 (a) _Admitted Claims_. If, within 20 Business Days after a Notice of Claim is delivered to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor agrees in writing that liability for such Claim is indemnified under _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_, as applicable, the full amount of the Damages specified in the Notice of Claim is agreed to, the Indemnitor (on behalf of the Company Holders if the Stockholder Representative is the Indemnitor) shall be conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by the Indemnitee of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of Claim in accordance with this _Article IX_, including, if the Stockholder Representative is the Indemnitor, the forfeiture of a portion of the Indemnity Escrow equal to such Damages, and Parent shall be authorized to deliver such agreement to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make a wire transfer to Parent in the amount of such Damages. 

  

 (b) _Contested Claims_. If the Indemnitor does not so agree in writing to such Notice of Claim or gives the other party written notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a " _Contested Claim_ ") within the 20 Business Day period specified in _Section 9.5(a)_ , then such Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (i) a written settlement agreement executed by Parent and the Stockholder Representative or (ii) in the absence of such a written settlement agreement within 45 Business Days of such notice or such longer period as is mutually agreed upon by the parties, by binding arbitration between Parent and the Stockholder Representative in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 9.5_. 

  

 (c) _Arbitration of Contested Claims_. Any Contested Claim that is not settled by the parties as set forth in _Section 9.5(b)_ shall be arbitrated in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall be by a single arbitrator selected by Parent and the Stockholder Representative in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be held in such place in the County of New York, New York as may be specified by the arbitrator (or any place agreed to by the Parent, the Stockholder Representative and the arbitrator). The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding as to any matters submitted under this  _Article IX_. The arbitration shall be governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 through 16, and judgment upon the award of the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such arbitration proceeding (including reasonable attorneys fees) shall be borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses. 

  

 (d) _Payment of Costs_. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company Holders (through the Stockholder Representative), on the other hand, shall bear the expense of deposits and advances required by the arbitrator in equal proportions, but either party may advance such amounts, subject to recovery as an addition or offset to any award. For the avoidance of doubt, the monetary recovery owed to the prevailing party to the arbitration proceeding shall include reimbursement of such advances; provided the right of Parent to recover any such advance shall not be limited to funds held in the Indemnity Escrow. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Burden of Proof_. Except as may be otherwise expressly provided herein, for any Contested Claim submitted to arbitration, the burden of proof shall be as it would be if the claim were litigated in a judicial proceeding governed exclusively by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed and entered into within the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of choice of law or conflicts of law of any jurisdiction. 

  

 (f) _Award_. Upon the conclusion of any arbitration proceedings hereunder, the arbitrator shall be instructed to render a final reasoned written arbitration award setting forth the basis and reasons for any decision reached (the " _Final Award_ ") and shall be instructed to deliver a signed copy of the Final Award to the Stockholder Representative and Parent. The Final Award shall constitute a conclusive determination of all issues in question, binding upon the Company Holders, the Stockholder Representative and Parent, and shall include an affirmative statement to such effect. 

  

 (g) _Timing_. The Stockholder Representative, Parent and the arbitrator shall conclude each arbitration pursuant to this _Section 9.5_ as promptly as possible for the Contested Claim being arbitrated. 

  

 (h) _Terms of Arbitration_. The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions shall not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration provisions or the provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 (i) _Payment to Parent_. If any Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to the recovery of Damages pursuant to any Claim that is agreed to pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_, or a Contested Claim that is resolved pursuant to _Section 9.5(c)_, Parent may require that the Escrow Agent disburse to Parent from the Indemnity Escrow in accordance with the Escrow Agreement the amount of Damages arising out of or resulting from such Claim as so determined. 

  

 SECTION 9.6. Survival of Covenants, Representations and Warranties. 

  

 Except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.1(b)_, all representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement, as qualified by the Schedules hereto and the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_, shall remain operative and in full force and effect until that date which is the earlier of (a) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ and (b) October 15, 2011 (the " _Release Date_ ").

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section 9.7_ shall not apply to any action or claim by any party for specific performance or injunctive relief with respect to any failure by any other party to perform any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement, or claims under _Section 7.11_, _Section 9.8_ or any Joinder Agreement or any claims or causes of actions for fraud.

Expense Fund and pay such amounts therefrom as the Stockholder Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in its good faith judgment; and (v) take all
actions necessary in the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. The Stockholder Representative shall have no
authority or power to act on behalf of the Company. The Stockholder
Representative shall have authority and power to act on behalf of the Company
Holders with respect to the disposition, settlement or other handling of the
adjustments contemplated by  _Section 2.3_ and all claims under this
_Article IX_ and all rights or obligations arising under _Section 2.3_ and
this _Article IX_ or otherwise as contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company Holders shall be bound by all actions taken and documents executed by
the Stockholder Representative in connection with _Section 2.3_ and this
_Article_   _IX_ , and Parent shall be entitled to rely on any action or
decision of the Stockholder Representative. In performing the functions
specified in this Agreement, the Stockholder Representative may act upon any
instrument or other writing believed by the Stockholder Representative in
good faith to be genuine and to be signed or presented by the proper Person
and shall not be liable in connection with the performance by it of its
duties pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
The Stockholder Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless (out of
funds that otherwise are to be distributed from the Escrow Funds or the
Sellers Expense Fund to the Company Holders, if any, or other amounts paid to
the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Company Holders behalf
pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ , as described in this _Section 9.8_) from and
against any loss, liability or expense incurred on the part of the
Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder. Any out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in connection with
actions taken by the Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of
_Section 2.3_ or this _Article IX_ or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement including the hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of legal
fees and costs, (" _Representative Expenses_ "), shall be the
responsibility of the Company Holders. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall have full power and authority
to interpret all the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and to consent to any amendment hereof or thereof, on behalf of
all the Company Holders and their respective heirs, successors and assigns. 

  

 (b) The Company Holders hereby appoint and constitute the Stockholder Representative the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the Company Holders, with full power in their name and on their behalf to act according to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to expend the Sellers Expense Fund and to reimburse itself, to pay to the Company Holders any amounts paid to the Stockholder Representative from the Escrow Funds or other amounts paid to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_, and in general to do all things and to perform all acts including executing and delivering the Escrow Agreement and any other agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, 

   ##### 

  

    

notices or instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with
the Escrow Agreement. This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and
all authority hereby conferred is granted and shall be irrevocable and shall
not be terminated or affected by subsequent disability or incapacity of any
Company Holder or by any act of any Company Holder or by operation of law,
whether by such persons death (unless the Stockholder Representative has
actual knowledge of such persons death), disability, protective supervision
or any other event. Without limiting the foregoing, this power of attorney is
to ensure the performance of a special obligation and, accordingly,
each Company Holder shall be deemed to have waived and renounced its, his or
her right to renounce this power of attorney unilaterally any time before the
day following the Escrow Termination Date. Each Company Holder shall be
deemed to have waived any and all defenses that may be available to contest,
negate or disaffirm the action of the Stockholder Representative taken in good
faith under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the power
of attorney granted in this  _Section 9.8_, no agreement, instrument,
acknowledgement or other act or document shall be ineffective solely by
reason of a Company Holder (instead of the Stockholder Representative)
having signed or given the same directly. 

  

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 9.8_ shall in no way impose any obligations on Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation. In particular, notwithstanding any notice received by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be fully protected in relying upon and shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall have no liability to the Company Holders with respect to actions, decisions or determinations of the Stockholder Representative. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to assume that all actions, decisions and determinations of the Stockholder Representative are fully authorized.

 Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Stockholder Representative and its Affiliates (collectively, " _ABRY_ ") and the Company have been represented by the law firm of Kirkland and Ellis LLP (the " _Firm_ ") in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the Merger. The parties agree that, while the representation by the Firm in the negotiation of this Agreement and the Merger has nominally been of the Company, the Firms true clients have been ABRY. As a consequence, the parties agree: (i) that the holder of the privilege with respect to any discussions with any client of the Firm relative to this Agreement and the Merger prior to the date of the Closing shall be ABRY, and the Company shall have no rights thereto; and (ii) that none of the parties hereto shall take any action to attempt to disqualify the Firm from representing ABRY or any other Company Holder in connection with any dispute relating to this Agreement or the Merger based on the representation by the Firm of the Company in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the Merger or prior to the Closing. 

  

 SECTION 11.14. Counterparts.
