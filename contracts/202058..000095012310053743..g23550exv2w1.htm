respect to each Government Contract and Government Subcontract (a)&nbsp;the name or, if customary, the
code name of each customer, (b)&nbsp;an indication whether the Company Entity that is a party thereto is
acting as the prime contractor or a subcontractor, (c)&nbsp;a reference as to whether the applicable
Government Contract or Government Subcontract is firm fixed price, cost plus, time and material or
other type of contract (or a combination thereof) and , if applicable, with any incentives, (d)&nbsp;the
periods of performance, (e)&nbsp;the activity of the applicable Government Contract or Government
Subcontract whether (i)&nbsp;satellite services, (ii)&nbsp;special operations or (iii)&nbsp;IT, network or telecom
related, (f)&nbsp;the contract revenue for 2009, (g)&nbsp;the total dollar value of the contract award, (h)
the ceiling of the contract vehicle, if know and applicable, (i)&nbsp;the contract
revenue from inception of the applicable Government Contract or Government Subcontract, (j)
the dollar amount of the Contract Backlog, (k)&nbsp;the funded portion of the Contract Backlog, (l)&nbsp;the

Contract Backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and obligated to such contract or

recognized on such contract by the Company Entities. Funded Backlog excludes options and any

received funding. &#147;<U>Unfunded Backlog</U>&#148; is Contract Backlog less Funded Backlog.

a Claim, an &#147;<U>Indemnitee</U>&#148;). An Indemnitee may give notice of a Claim under this Agreement,
whether for its own Damages or for Damages incurred by any other Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, pursuant to written notice of such Claim executed by an officer
of Parent (in the case of a Claim by a Buyer Indemnified Person) or the Stockholder Representative
(in the case of a Claim by a Seller Indemnified Person) (a &#147;<U>Notice of Claim</U>&#148;), and

Indemnitee). Following delivery of the Notice of Claim (or at the same time if the
Indemnitee so elects) the Indemnitee shall deliver copies of any demand or complaint, it
shall receive from any third party and, reasonably promptly after such information becomes
