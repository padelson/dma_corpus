merging directly with and into Parent, with the Company Shares converted in

Time minus (II) the product of the number of Mixed Consideration Electing
Shares (including any Non-Electing Company Shares) and the Per Share Cash
Amount (such difference being the " ** _Available Cash Election Amount_** "),
then each Cash Electing Company Share shall be converted into a right to
receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product (rounded
to two decimal places) of (p) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and
(q) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election
Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such
fraction being the " ** _Cash Fraction_** ") and (2) a number of validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of (r) the Exchange Ratio and (s) one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

 



 

(C) Each Company Share with respect to which an election to receive only stock
consideration (a " ** _Stock Election_** ") has been effectively made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (each, a " ** _Stock Electing
Company Share_** ") shall be converted ( _provided_ that the Cash Election
Amount equals or exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount), into a number of
shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent
Common Stock (the

 



       
 

 



 

" ** _Exchange Ratio_** "), subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section
2.1(b)(iii)_, equal to (i) the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio plus (ii)
the quotient (rounded to four decimal places) of the Per Share Cash Amount
divided by the Closing Volume-Weighted Average Price; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount,
then each Stock Electing Company Share shall be converted into the right to
receive (1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount (rounded
to two decimal places) of such excess divided by the number of Stock Electing
Company Shares and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded to four
decimal places) of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the Per Share Cash Election Consideration minus the amount
calculated in clause (1) of this paragraph and the denominator of which shall
be the Per Share Cash Election Consideration.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or the outstanding Company Shares or the securities
convertible into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or
stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Merger Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide the holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

(iv) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued, and cash payable, upon
the conversion of Company Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.1(b)_ and cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by
_Section 2.2(e)_, are referred to collectively as " ** _Merger
Consideration_**."

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Company Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262
of the DGCL (" ** _Appraisal Shares_** ") shall not be converted into Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(b)_, but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of
the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holderÂ’s Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares
shall be deemed to be Mixed Consideration Electing Shares that have been
converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.1(b)(ii)(A)_. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares, and
Parent shall have

 



      
 

 



 

the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Actions with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Company Shares_ _._

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a nationally
recognized financial institution designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " ** _Exchange Agent_** "), for the benefit of
the holders of Company Shares, for exchange in accordance with this Article _
II_, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the full number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section _ 2.1_ in exchange
for outstanding Company Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide or shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent all of the cash
necessary to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, and shall,
after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable,
provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_ (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the
Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other distributions with
respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Exchange Fund_**
"). For the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not
be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available
to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance
with _Section 2.2(e)_. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Parent Common
Stock and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.1_ out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(b) Each registered holder of one or more Company Book-Entry Shares shall
automatically upon the delivery of a Form of Election be entitled to receive,
the Merger Consideration. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Company Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such
Company Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 



 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
Company Book-Entry Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, until
delivery of a Form of Election, in accordance with this Article _ II_.
Subject to applicable Law, following delivery of a Form of Election, there
shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such delivery, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_ and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such delivery and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Merger Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon conversion of any Company Shares shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Shares (other than the right to receive dividends or other
distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_). After the
Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Shares pursuant to
_Section 2.1_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock.
For purposes of this _Section 2.2(e)_, all fractional shares to which a
single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated, and calculations
shall be rounded to three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional
shares, each holder of Company Shares who would otherwise be entitled to such
fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest,
rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of
the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled under _Section 2.1(b)_ (or would be entitled but for this
_Section 2.2(e)_) and (ii) an amount equal to the Closing Volume-Weighted
Average Price. The amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company
Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock
shall be paid by the Exchange Agent, without interest, to the holders of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash at the time of payment of
the other Merger Consideration to which such holders are entitled.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Company Common Stock for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration and any dividends
or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by
_Section 2.2(c)(i)_.

 



 

(g) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund (including any amounts
delivered to Parent in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_) delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



 

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis, _provided_ that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable hereunder and
following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares in the amount
of any such losses to the extent that the amount then in the Exchange Fund is
insufficient to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, such amount deducted or withheld shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made, and, in the case
of any amounts withheld from any payments not consisting entirely of cash,
Parent shall be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of the
type of consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Stock, sold such consideration for an amount of cash
equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such
deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Company Election Procedures_ _._

 



 

(a) Each Person who, on or prior to the Election Deadline, is a record holder
of Company Shares other than Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to specify the
number of such holderÂ’s Company Shares with respect to which such holder makes
a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election.

 



 

(b) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the registration statement
on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the Share
Issuance (together with any amendment or supplements thereto, the " ** _Form
S-4_**") a form of election (the " ** _Form of Election_**") in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Company shall mail the
Form of Election with the proxy statement relating to the adoption and
approval of this Agreement by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders and the approval of
the Share Issuance by ParentÂ’s stockholders (together with any amendment or
supplements thereto, the " ** _Joint Proxy Statement_** ") to all Persons who
are record holders of Company Shares as of the record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting. The Form of Election shall be used by each record holder
of Company Shares (or, in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial
owner through proper instructions and documentation) to make a Cash Election,
a Stock Election or a Mixed Election. In the event that a holder fails to
make a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election with respect to any
Company Shares held or beneficially owned by such holder by the Election
Deadline, then such holder shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with
respect to those Company Shares (each such Company Share, a " ** _Non-Electing
Company Share_** "). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make the Form of Election available to all Persons who become record holders
of Company Shares during the period between the record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting and the Election Deadline.

 



 

(c) Any holderÂ’s election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received at its designated office by 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the date that is two (2) Business Days preceding the Closing Date
(the " ** _Election Deadline_** "), a Form of Election properly completed and
signed and accompanied by any additional documents required by the procedures
set forth in the Form of Election. After a Cash Election, a Stock Election or
a Mixed Election is validly made with respect to any Company Shares, no
further registration of transfers

 



      
 

 



 

of such Company Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the
Company, unless and until such Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election
is properly revoked.

 



 

(d) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Deadline at least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the
Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the
rescheduled Election Deadline.

 



 

(e) Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election may be revoked with
respect to all or a portion of the Company Shares subject thereto by the
holder who submitted the applicable Form of Election by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In addition,
all Cash Elections, Stock Elections and Mixed Elections shall automatically be
revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VII_. If
a Cash Election or Stock Election is revoked, the Company Shares as to which
such election previously applied shall be treated as Mixed Consideration
Electing Shares in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)(i)_ unless a contrary
election is submitted by the holder within the period during which elections
are permitted to be made pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_. The accounts of
holders of Company Book-Entry Shares will not be credited at the Depository
Trust Company, unless the holder so requests.

 



 

(f) The determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint determination of
Parent and the Company, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to make
any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding as to whether or not
Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been properly made or revoked
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ and as to when Cash Elections, Stock Elections
and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent (or
Parent and the Company jointly, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines
to make the following computation) shall also make all computations
contemplated by _Section 2.1(b)_, and absent manifest error this computation
shall be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written
agreement of Parent (subject to the consent of the Company, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any rules as are
consistent with this _Section 2.3_ for the implementation of the Cash
Elections and Stock Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be
necessary or desirable to effect these Cash Elections and Stock Elections.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Stock Awards_ _._

 



 

(a) Each option (or portion thereof) to purchase Company Common Stock granted
under any Company Stock Plan (a " ** _Company Stock Option_** "), whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease, at the Effective Time, to represent a right to
acquire Company Shares and shall be converted at the Effective Time, without
any action on the part of any holder of any Company Stock Option, into an
option to purchase Parent Common Stock (a " ** _Parent Stock Option_** "), on
the same terms and conditions (including vesting schedule) as were applicable
to such Company Stock Option (for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account
any changes thereto (including any acceleration or vesting thereof, as may be
provided for in the relevant Company Stock Plan, the applicable award document
or any applicable employment agreement or retention policy) in connection

 



      
 

 



 

with the Transactions). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
each such Parent Stock Option shall be equal to (i) the number of Company
Shares subject to each such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio (subject to adjustment
in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_), rounded down to the nearest whole
share of Parent Common Stock, and each such Parent Stock Option shall have an
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise price per Company Share specified in
such Company Stock Option, _divided by_ (y) the Exchange Ratio (subject to
adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_); _provided_ , that in
the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies
as of the Effective Time (after taking into account the effect of any
accelerated vesting thereof, if applicable) by reason of its qualification
under Section 422 or Section 423 of the Code, the exercise price, the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of each
Company Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding award of restricted Company
Common Stock (" ** _Company Restricted Shares_** ") granted pursuant to a
Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an award
of restricted shares of Parent Common Stock (" ** _Parent Restricted Shares_**
"). Each such Parent Restricted Share shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including vesting schedule) that applied to the corresponding
Company Restricted Share immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking
into account any changes thereto provided for in this Agreement). As of the
Effective Time, the number of Parent Restricted Shares into which the Company
Restricted Shares are so assumed and converted shall be equal to the product
of (i) the total number of outstanding Company Restricted Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to terminate the Company Stock Purchase Plan and all outstanding rights
thereunder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that from
and after the date hereof, the Company shall take all actions necessary to (i)
ensure that no new Offering Period (as such term is defined in the Company
Stock Purchase Plan) commences after the date hereof, (ii) ensure that no new
participants are permitted to participate in the Company Stock Purchase Plan
and that the existing participants thereunder may not increase their elections
with respect to the Offering Period in effect on the date hereof (the " **
_Final Payment Period_** ") and (iii) provide notice to participants
describing the treatment of the Company Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(c)_. If the Effective Time occurs during the Final Payment
Period, the Final Payment Period shall terminate no later than the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the Company shall cause the
exercise date applicable to the Final Payment Period to accelerate and occur
on such termination date with respect to any then-outstanding options.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (A) all amounts allocated to
each participantÂ’s account under the Company Stock Purchase Plan at the end of
the Final Payment Period shall thereupon be used to purchase from the Company
whole Company Shares at the applicable price under the Company Stock Purchase
Plan for such Final Payment Period, which Company Shares shall be canceled at

 



      
 

 



 

the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_, and (B) as promptly as
practicable following the purchase of Company Shares in accordance with the
foregoing clause (A) each participant in the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall
be returned the funds, if any, that remain in such participantÂ’s account after
such purchase.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company (the "
** _Company Board_** ") (or an appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt such
resolutions as are necessary for the treatment of the Company Restricted
Shares, Company Stock Options and rights under the Company Stock Purchase Plan
(collectively, the " ** _Company Stock Awards_** ") as contemplated by this
_Section 2.4_.

Except as (a) set forth in the corresponding section of the disclosure letter
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the " ** _Company Disclosure Letter_** ") which shall be arranged
in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered

or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now being conducted and is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or

security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in voting
rights, charges, mortgages or other encumbrances (collectively, " ** _Liens_**
") of any nature whatsoever, except for restrictions on transfer under
securities Laws, and all of such outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity interests have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except for equity interests
in the Subsidiaries of the Company and equity interests in another Person held

(assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the counterparties
hereto) constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms except to the
extent that enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,

by or with respect to any employees of any of the Acquired Companies, whether

picketing, work stoppage, lockout or organizational activity has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each Acquired Company has complied in all respects with all applicable Laws
and administrative and regulatory requirements relating to wages, hours,
immigration, discrimination in employment and collective bargaining, as well
as the Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and comparable

or penalties for failure to comply with any of the foregoing, except for such
failures to comply that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Further,
there are no Actions or material charges, grievances, complaints or
investigations pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by or
on behalf of any employee or group of employees of any of the Acquired
Companies, including any charges, grievances, complaints or investigations

employment, whether domestic or international, including without limitation,
Laws related to wages and hours (including the Fair Labor Standards Act and

Administration, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the U.S. or any

consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization, except

Section 5.3 _Company Acquisition Proposals_ _._

 



 

(a) Following the execution of this Agreement, the Acquired Companies shall,
and shall direct their respective Representatives to, (i) immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal
or any proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously made available by it or
on its behalf in connection with any actual or potential Company Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify in
any respect any provision of any confidentiality agreement to which any
Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal,
and shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
provisions of any such agreement, including obtaining injunctions to prevent
any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be
entitled to waive any standstill provision included in any such
confidentiality agreement or any standstill provision contained in any
standstill agreement to which any Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives is a party with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal or
any proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel) that failure to
waive such standstill would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The Acquired Companies shall not, and shall direct their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or knowingly induce or facilitate the making, submission
or announcement of any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
constituting, related to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) make available any information regarding
any of the Acquired Companies to any Person (other than Parent and ParentÂ’s or

with or in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry
or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal

discussions), (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Company Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably be expected
to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (v) make or authorize any

be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (vi) enter into any
letter of intent or agreement in principle or any Contract providing for,
relating to or in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal or any

reimburse the expenses of any other Person (other than the CompanyÂ’s
Representatives) in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, discussion, offer or request that could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.3_, if at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company
receives, after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited _bona fide_
written Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) such Company Acquisition Proposal
did not result from a breach of this Agreement and (iii) the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal
counsel and outside financial advisors) that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal, then, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company may (x) make available information with respect to the Acquired
Companies to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a
Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that any non-public
information provided or made available to any Person given such access shall
have been previously provided or made available to Parent or shall be provided
or made available to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is
provided or made available to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal
regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Acquired Companies shall, and shall cause its and their respective
Representatives to, cease any activities described in clause (x) or (y) of
this _Section 5.3(c)_ immediately following the time the applicable Company
Acquisition Proposal ceases to be a Company Superior Proposal or a Company
Acquisition Proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Superior Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any Company
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal (including the identity
of the Person making or submitting such Company Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry, proposal or offer, and the terms and conditions thereof) that is made
or submitted by any Person prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall keep
Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status of, and any
financial or other changes in, any such Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
proposal or offer, including providing Parent copies of any correspondence
related thereto and proposed documents to effect such Company Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.3(e)_, _5.3(f)_ or _5.3(g)_ ,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) directly or
indirectly, fail to make, withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent) the Company Recommendation or the approval of this
Agreement, the Merger, the Subsequent Merger or any of the other Transactions,
take any action (or permit or authorize any of the Acquired Companies or any
of their respective Representatives to take any such action) inconsistent with
the Company Recommendation or resolve, agree or propose to take any such
actions (each such action set forth in this _Section 5.3(d)(i)(A)_ being
referred to herein as a " ** _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_** ") or
(B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable any
Company Acquisition Proposal or resolve, agree or propose to take any such
actions, (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement related to a Company Acquisition Proposal (other
than a Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with
_Section 5.3(c)_), (iii) take any action to make the provisions of any
Takeover Laws or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover
provision in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company,
inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by a Company

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal (including approving any transaction under the DGCL) or
(iv) resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 5.3(d)_, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, provided that the Acquired Companies have
complied with the applicable provisions of this _Section 5.3_, then, prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, solely in
response to a Company Superior Proposal received on or after the date hereof
that has not been withdrawn or abandoned and that did not result from a breach
of this Agreement, make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and may cause
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(iv)_
(including payment of the Termination Fee) and concurrently enter into a
binding definitive agreement to effect such Company Superior Proposal. Neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(iv)_ or cause the Company to enter into a binding definitive agreement
to effect such Company Superior Proposal unless the Company has first complied
with the provisions of _Section 5.3(f)_ and, after so complying, the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside
legal counsel) that such Company Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute
a Company Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) The Company Board shall not take any action set forth in _Section 5.3(e)_
unless the Company has first (i) provided written notice to Parent (a " **
_Notice of Company Superior Proposal_** ") advising Parent that the Company
has received a Company Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions
of such Company Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Company
Superior Proposal and providing copies of any agreements intended to effect
such Company Superior Proposal, and that the Company Board has made the
determination required under _Section 5.3(e)_, (ii) negotiated, and caused
the Company and its Representatives to negotiate, during the five (5) Business
Day period following ParentÂ’s receipt of the Notice of Company Superior
Proposal (the " ** _Company Superior Proposal Notice Period_** "), in good
faith with Parent to enable Parent to make a counteroffer or propose to amend
the terms of this Agreement (to the extent Parent wishes to do so) so that
such Company Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, and (iii) after complying with clauses (i) and (ii), reaffirmed such
determination in light of any counteroffer or proposed amendment to the terms
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if during the Company
Superior Proposal Notice Period any revisions are made to a Company
Acquisition Proposal and such revisions are material (it being understood and
agreed that any change to consideration with respect to such proposal is
material), the Company shall deliver a new Notice of Company Superior Proposal
to Parent and shall comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(f)_
with respect to such new Notice of Company Superior Proposal.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board, in
circumstances not involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal,
from effecting a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the
occurrence of a Company Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel) that
the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and
the Company has first (i) provided written notice to Parent (a " ** _Notice of
Company Intervening Event_** ") describing the Company Intervening Event and
advising Parent that the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor
in reasonable detail; (ii) negotiated, and caused the Company and its
Representatives to negotiate, during the five (5) Business Days following
ParentÂ’s receipt of the Notice of Company Intervening Event (the " ** _Company
Intervening Event Notice Period_** "), in good faith with Parent regarding any
revisions to the terms of the Transactions proposed by Parent in response to
such Company Intervening Event; and (iii) at the end of the Company
Intervening Event Notice Period, the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel (and taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent), that a Company Intervening Event continues to exist and that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law.

 



 

(h) The Company agrees that it shall take all actions necessary so that any
Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this
Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board or any committee thereof
in any respect that would have the effect of causing any of the Takeover Laws
of any state (including Delaware) or other similar statutes to be applicable
to the Transactions, including the Merger and the Subsequent Merger.

 



 

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that
the stockholders of the Company tender any securities in connection with any
tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any
Company Acquisition Proposal), unless in each case, in connection therewith,
the Company Board effects a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section 5.3(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ that any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation and rejects any
Company Acquisition Proposal within the later of (A) three (3) Business Days
after such stop, look and listen communication and (B) if applicable, the
deadline for filing a Schedule 14D-9 with respect to such Company Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(j) Any action taken or not taken by any Representative of any of the Acquired
Companies acting on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies that if taken or
not taken by the Company would constitute a breach of this _Section 5.3_
shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

confidentiality agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and
(taken as a whole) no less favorable to the Company than, those set forth in

prohibit the making or amendment of any Company Acquisition Proposal, except

the Company for amendments, waivers or consents under, or agreements not to

occurrence (or the magnitude of which) becomes known to or by the Company
Board after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company Intervening Event

Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or

Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) make available any information regarding any
of the Parent Companies to any Person (other than the Company and ParentÂ’s or
the CompanyÂ’s Representatives acting in their capacity as such) in connection
with or in response to a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any

 



      
 

 



 

proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with
any Person with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any proposal,
inquiry or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal (other than to state that they currently are not
permitted to have discussions), (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Parent
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (v) make or authorize
any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Parent
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (vi) enter into any
letter of intent or agreement in principle or any Contract providing for,

proposal, inquiry or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than a Parent Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement in accordance with _Section 5.4(c)_) or (vii) reimburse or agree to
reimburse the expenses of any other Person (other than ParentÂ’s
Representatives) in connection with a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, discussion, offer or request that could reasonably be expected to

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.4_, if at any
time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, (i) Parent receives,
after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Parent
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) such Parent Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a breach of this Agreement and (iii) Parent Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with ParentÂ’s outside legal counsel and outside
financial advisors) that such Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, then, prior to
obtaining Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent may (x) make available
information with respect to the Parent Companies to the Person making such
Parent Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a Parent Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , that any non-public information provided or made
available to any Person given such access shall have been previously provided
or made available to the Company or shall be provided or made available to the
Company prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided or made
available to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal regarding such Parent
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Companies
shall, and shall cause its and their respective Representatives to, cease any
activities described in clause (x) or (y) of this _Section 5.4(c)_
immediately following the time the applicable Parent Acquisition Proposal
ceases to be a Parent Superior Proposal or a Parent Acquisition Proposal that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal. Parent
shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise the
Company in writing of the receipt of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the Person making or
submitting such Parent Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer, and
the terms and conditions thereof) that is made or submitted by any Person

reasonably current basis, of the status of, and any financial or other changes
in, any such Parent Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer,
including providing Parent copies of any correspondence related thereto and
proposed documents to effect such Parent Acquisition Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.4(e)_, _5.4(f)_ or _5.4(g)_ ,
neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) directly or
indirectly, fail to make, withhold, withdraw or qualify (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent) the Parent Recommendation or the approval of this
Agreement, the Merger, the Subsequent Merger or any of the other Transactions,
take any action (or permit or authorize any of the Parent Companies or any of
their respective Representatives to take any such action) inconsistent with
the Parent Recommendation or resolve, agree or propose to take any such
actions (each such action set forth in this _Section 5.4(d)(i)(A)_ being
referred to herein as a " ** _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_** ") or
(B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable any
Parent Acquisition Proposal or resolve, agree or propose to take any such
actions, (ii) cause or permit Parent to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other agreement related to a Parent Acquisition Proposal (other
than a Parent Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with _Section
5.4(c)_), (iii) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Laws or
any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover provision in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent, inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by a Parent Acquisition Proposal (including
approving any transaction under the DGCL) or (iv) resolve, agree or propose to
take any such actions.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 5.4(d)_, at any time prior to obtaining Parent
Stockholder Approval, provided that the Parent Companies have complied with
the applicable provisions of this _Section 5.4_, then, prior to obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board may, solely in response to a
Parent Superior Proposal received on or after the date hereof that has not
been withdrawn or abandoned and that did not result from a breach of this
Agreement, make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and may cause Parent to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(iv)_ (including payment
of the Termination Fee) and concurrently enter into a binding definitive
agreement to effect such Parent Superior Proposal. Neither the Parent Board
nor any committee thereof shall make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(iv)_ or cause Parent to
enter into a binding definitive agreement to effect such Parent Superior
Proposal unless Parent has first complied with the provisions of _Section
5.4(f)_ and, after so complying, the Parent Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with ParentÂ’s outside legal counsel) that such Parent
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) The Parent Board shall not take any action set forth in _Section 5.4(e)_
unless Parent has first (i) provided written notice to the Company (a " **
_Notice of Parent Superior Proposal_** ") advising the Company that Parent has
received a Parent Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of
such Parent Superior Proposal, identifying the Person making such Parent
Superior Proposal and providing copies of any agreements intended to effect
such Parent Superior Proposal, and that the Parent Board has made the
determination required under _Section 5.4(e)_, (ii) negotiated, and caused
Parent and its Representatives to negotiate, during the five (5) Business Day
period following the CompanyÂ’s receipt of the Notice of Parent Superior
Proposal (the " ** _Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period_** "), in good
faith with the Company to enable the Company to make a counteroffer or propose
to amend the terms of this Agreement (to the extent the Company wishes to do
so) so that such Parent Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Parent
Superior Proposal, and (iii) after complying with clauses (i) and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii), reaffirmed such determination in light of any counteroffer or proposed
amendment to the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
during the Parent Superior Proposal Notice Period any revisions are made to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal and such revisions are material (it being
understood and agreed that any change to consideration with respect to such
proposal is material), Parent shall deliver a new Notice of Parent Superior
Proposal to Parent and shall comply with the requirements of this _Section
5.4(f)_ with respect to such new Notice of Parent Superior Proposal.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Parent Board, in
circumstances not involving or relating to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, from
effecting a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the occurrence
of a Parent Intervening Event if the Parent Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with ParentÂ’s outside legal counsel) that the failure to
do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Parent under applicable Law and Parent has first
(i) provided written notice to the Company (a " ** _Notice of Parent
Intervening Event_** ") describing the Parent Intervening Event and advising
the Company that the Parent Board intends to take such action and specifying
the reasons therefor in reasonable detail; (ii) negotiated, and caused Parent
and its Representatives to negotiate, during the five (5) Business Days
following the CompanyÂ’s receipt of the Notice of Parent Intervening Event (the
" ** _Parent Intervening Event Notice Period_** "), in good faith with the
Company regarding any revisions to the terms of the Transactions proposed by
the Company in response to such Parent Intervening Event; and (iii) at the end
of the Parent Intervening Event Notice Period, the Parent Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with ParentÂ’s outside legal counsel (and taking
into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Company), that a Parent Intervening Event continues to exist
and that the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of Parent under applicable Law.

 



 

(h) Parent agrees that it shall take all actions necessary so that any Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this Agreement
or any other approval of the Parent Board or any committee thereof in any
respect that would have the effect of causing any of the Takeover Laws of any
state (including Delaware) or other similar statutes to be applicable to the
Transactions, including the Merger and the Subsequent Merger.

 



 

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Parent Board
from taking and disclosing a position contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A, Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Parent
Board (or any committee thereof) shall be permitted to recommend that the
stockholders of Parent tender any securities in connection with any tender or
exchange offer (or otherwise approve, endorse or recommend any Parent
Acquisition Proposal), unless in each case, in connection therewith, the
Parent Board effects a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
_Section 5.4(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ that any such disclosure (other than
a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Parent Board expressly
reaffirms the Parent Recommendation and rejects any Parent Acquisition
Proposal within the later of (A) three (3) Business Days after such stop, look

 



       
 

 



 

and listen communication and (B) if applicable, the deadline for filing a
Schedule 14D-9 with respect to such Parent Acquisition Proposal

 



 

(j) Any action taken or not taken by any Representative of any of the Parent
Companies acting on behalf of any of the Parent Companies that if taken or not
taken by Parent would constitute a breach of this _Section 5.4_ shall be
deemed a breach of this Agreement by Parent.

(i) " ** _Parent Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_** " means a
confidentiality agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and
(taken as a whole) no less favorable to Parent than, those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that such confidentiality agreement
(i) must contain a "standstill" or similar provision or otherwise prohibit the
making or amendment of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, except that such
provisions may include an exception solely to allow the other party to the
agreement to (x) make a confidential Parent Acquisition Proposal to the Parent
Board or (y) make confidential requests to Parent for amendments, waivers or
consents under, or agreements not to enforce, such "standstill", similar
provision or other provision that prohibits the making of a Parent Acquisition
Proposal and (ii) shall not prohibit compliance by any of the Parent Companies
with any of the provisions of this Agreement.

the Parent Companies representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues,

transaction in which the holders of the voting power of Parent immediately
prior to such transaction own 80% or less of the voting power of Parent
immediately following the transaction, (E) ** ** transaction in which any

indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right
to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or (F) ** ** any combination of the foregoing (in each
case, other than the Merger and the Subsequent Merger).

 



 

(iii) " ** _Parent Intervening Event_** " means an event, fact, circumstance,
development or occurrence that is material to the Parent Companies, taken as a
whole, that is not known or reasonably foreseeable (or the magnitude of which
is not known or reasonably foreseeable) to or by the Parent Board as of the
date of this Agreement, which

 



      
 

 



 

event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence (or the magnitude of
which) becomes known to or by the Parent Board after the date hereof and prior
to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Parent Intervening Event relates to an event, fact, circumstance,
development or occurrence involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
then such event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence shall not
constitute a Parent Intervening Event unless it has a Company Material Adverse
Effect; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the following
constitute a Parent Intervening Event: (i) the receipt, existence or terms of
a Parent Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or matter relating thereto or
consequence thereof, (ii) events or circumstances arising from the
announcement or the existence of, or any action taken by either party pursuant
to and in compliance with the terms of, this Agreement and (iii) changes in

Section 5.5 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholder Meetings_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the Form S-4,
in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of the
Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall provide the
other with the opportunity to review and comment on such documents prior to
their filing with the SEC. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to
keep the Form S-4 effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and
the Subsequent Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause to be delivered to the other a "comfort letter" of its
independent auditors, dated the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to
the date on which the Form S-4 becomes effective. No filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the

 



      
 

 



 

Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the Company,
as applicable, without the otherÂ’s prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other
the reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent or the
Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after (i) it receives
oral or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective,
(ii) any supplement or amendment to the Form S-4 has been filed, (iii) it
becomes aware of the issuance of any stop order with respect to the Form S-4,
(iv) it becomes aware of the suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, (v) the receipt of (A) any oral or written request by the
SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or (B) comments
thereon from the SEC or (vi) providing responses to the SEC with respect to
_(A)_ or _(B)_ of the foregoing clause (v). Parent or the Company, as
applicable, will promptly provide the other with copies of any written
communication received from the SEC or any state securities commission with
respect to the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement or the qualification of the
Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Share Issuance. ** ** If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or
the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is
discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC, after the other party has had a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the respective stockholders of Parent and the
Company. Parent will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to ParentÂ’s
stockholders, and the Company will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders, in each case as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following
effectiveness of the Form S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " ** _Company Stockholder Meeting_** ") for
the purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. Subject to ** **
_Sections 5.3(e),_ _5.3(f)_ and _5.3(g)_ , the Company shall, through the
Company Board, recommend that its stockholders adopt and approve this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger (the " ** _Company
Recommendation_** "), and shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) ** **
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and (ii) ** ** take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the Company Stockholder Approval, and the Company Board shall not
withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to
Parent. The Company shall have the right to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting (A) for the absence of a quorum, (B) to allow reasonable
additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent that at such time
the Company has not received a number of proxies that it reasonably believes
sufficient to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval at the Company
Stockholder Meeting, (C) to the extent required by applicable Law or (D) with
the written consent of Parent. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the CompanyÂ’s obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.5(b)_ shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
public or private communication to the Company of any Company

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal or by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1(d)(iv)_.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following effectiveness of
the Form S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the " ** _Parent Stockholder Meeting_** ") for the purpose of
seeking the Parent Stockholder Approval. Subject to ** ** _Sections 5.4(e)_ ,
_5.4(f)_ and _5.4(g)_ , Parent shall, through the Parent Board, recommend
that its stockholders approve the Share Issuance (the " ** _Parent
Recommendation_** ") and shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) ** **
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Share
Issuance and (ii) ** ** take all other action necessary or advisable to secure
the Parent Stockholder Approval, and the Parent Board shall not withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify
or qualify the Parent Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent. Parent
shall have the right to postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholder Meeting (A)
for the absence of a quorum, (B) to allow reasonable additional time to
solicit additional proxies to the extent that at such time Parent has not
received a number of proxies that it reasonably believes sufficient to obtain
the Parent Stockholder Approval at the Parent Stockholder Meeting, (C) to the
extent required by applicable Law or (D) with the written consent of the
Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, ParentÂ’s
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.5(c)_ shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or public or private
communication to Parent of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or by a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with _Section 7.1(c)(iv)_.

 



 

(d) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting on the same
date, including by postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting or
the Parent Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, if the other party postpones or
adjourns the Parent Stockholder Meeting or the Company Stockholder Meeting, as
applicable.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to contractual
and legal restrictions applicable to the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the
Representatives of such other party, reasonable access during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement to all of their respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records (including the work papers of independent
accountants, if available and subject to the consent of such independent
accountants), and, during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall,
and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
the other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements
of federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access does not unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of the Acquired Companies or the Parent
Companies, as applicable. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.6_
shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party
hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. This
_Section 5.6_ shall not require any Acquired Company or Parent Company to
permit any access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of such party would reasonably be expected to result in (i) the

 



      
 

 



 

disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or a violation of any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if such party shall have used
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to
such inspection or disclosure, (ii) the loss of attorney-client privilege with
respect to such information or (iii) in the case of documents or portions of
documents relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive, a
violation of applicable Law (including any Regulatory Law). If any material is
withheld by such party pursuant to the preceding sentence, such party shall
inform the other party as to the general nature of what is being withheld. All
information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall be subject to the
Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated August 3, 2016,
between the Company and Parent (the " ** _Confidentiality Agreement_** ").

 



 

Section 5.7 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, and no party hereto shall fail
to take or cause to be taken any action that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
all obligations of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and the Company relating to
the Debt Financing shall be governed exclusively by _Section 5.19_, and not
by this _Section 5.7_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC to, and no Acquired
Company shall, without the prior written consent of Parent, agree to any
modification to or accommodation under any Contract or pay any fee, penalty or
other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval required
for the consummation of the Transactions. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make, if required, appropriate
filings under any Regulatory Law, and each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions within a reasonable time period not to exceed
thirty (30) days from the date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other
commercially reasonable actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable, including by requesting early termination of the
waiting period provided for in the HSR Act.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees to submit to the staff of the SEC a draft form of the
necessary documents required in connection with the approval contemplated by
_Section 6.1(g)(i)_, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof
(but in any event within twenty (20) days after the date of this Agreement),
and thereafter to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested, and
to take all other commercially reasonable actions necessary, in connection
therewith. Parent will reasonably cooperate promptly with the Company in
connection with the preparation of the necessary documents required in
connection with the approval contemplated by _Section 6.1(g)(i)_ and in
responding to any requests from the SEC in connection therewith.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced
in _Section 5.7(a)_ to obtain all

 



      
 

 



 

requisite approvals and authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act
or any other Regulatory Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) ** **
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any Action initiated by a private party, (ii) ** ** keep the other
party reasonably informed of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " ** _FTC_** "), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " ** _DOJ_** ") or any
other U.S. or non-U.S. Governmental Entity and of any communication received
or given in connection with any Action by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the Transactions and (iii) ** ** permit the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review any substantive written communication given
by it to (including the documentation referenced in _Section 5.7(a)_), and
consult with each other in advance of any scheduled substantive meeting or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any Action by a private party, with any other Person, and to
the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental
Entity or other Person, give the other party the reasonable opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other side under this _Section 5.7(c)_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material."
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to
the outside counsel regarding Regulatory Law of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants
of the recipient or any of its Affiliates unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (the Company or Parent,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each of the Company and Parent shall
cause its respective counsel regarding Regulatory Law to comply with this
_Section 5.7(c)_.

 



 

(d) No party hereto and no Parent Company or Acquired Company shall, without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) consent to or accept or
enter into any operational restriction, consent decree or hold separate order
or make any divestiture or other undertaking to obtain requisite approvals and
authorizations for the Transactions from any Governmental Entity; _provided_
that, without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, either
party hereto and any Parent Company or Acquired Company may divest or dispose
of any assets or business that generated $1,000,000 or less in net revenue
during 2015. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Parent Company or Acquired Company shall be obligated to, and no party hereto
shall, without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto (which
consent shall be in the sole discretion of such other parties) consent to
accept or enter into any operational restriction, consent decree or hold
separate order or make any divestiture or other undertaking to obtain
requisite approvals and authorizations for the Transactions from any
Governmental Entity, in each case, that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to (i) have a material adverse effect on the
business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of
the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, or (ii) have a material adverse
effect on the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition or results of
operations of the Parent Companies, taken as a whole, after giving effect to
the Merger (provided that for the purpose of determining whether a potential
adverse effect on the Parent Companies, taken as a whole, after giving effect
to the Merger, would constitute a material adverse effect, the Parent
Companies, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger, shall be
deemed to be a consolidated group of entities of the size and scale of a
hypothetical company that is 100% of the

 



      
 

 



 

size and scale of the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole) (each of the
effects described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence being referred to
herein as a " ** _Burdensome Effect_** ").

 



 

Section 5.8 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period ending not earlier than December 31, 2017 (or, if the Closing
Date occurs after March 31, 2017, for a period of not less than 12 months
after the Closing Date), Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Company) to, provide each Continuing Employee with
(i) a base salary or wage or commission rate, in each case, at least equal to
the base salary or wage or commission rate provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (except as otherwise may be
agreed upon by any Continuing Employee), (ii) severance pay and benefits no
less favorable than the severance pay and benefits provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (iii) other compensation,
fringe benefits and employee benefits (other than defined benefit pension
benefits and retiree health and welfare benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the other compensation, fringe benefits and
employee benefits (other than defined benefit pension benefits and retiree
health and welfare benefits, if any) provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Parent agrees to honor, or shall cause
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) to honor and assume, the
contractual obligations of the Acquired Companies under the provisions of each
Company Plan as such plan or agreement relates to each Continuing Employee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 5.8(a)_ is
intended to prevent Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Company) from amending or terminating any such Company Plan in accordance with
its terms.

 



 

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Company) to, provide each Continuing Employee with
full credit for prior service with the Acquired Companies (as well as service
with any predecessor employer) for all purposes under any Parent Employee Plan
in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate on or
after the Closing Date, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level
of benefits (including for purposes of vacation and severance) and benefit
accruals (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit plan
of any of the Parent Companies or for purposes of determining eligibility for
retiree health and welfare benefits), in each case, (i) to the extent such
service was recognized by any Acquired Company prior to the Closing and (ii)
except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee shall be retroactively eligible to
participate in any Parent Employee Plan, including any such Parent Employee
Plan that was frozen prior to the Effective Time. With respect to the relevant
health and welfare benefit plans in which each Continuing Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) is eligible to participate from and after the Closing
Date, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Company) to, (i) waive any limitations or exclusions on benefits relating to
pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work requirements, waiting periods and
similar limitations and requirements to the same extent such limitations,
exclusions and requirements would not have been applicable to such Continuing
Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) under the terms of any comparable
plan of the Acquired Companies and (ii) recognize, or cause to be recognized,
the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses
incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents)
during the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of
satisfying

 



      
 

 



 

such yearÂ’s co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses to the same extent
as such Continuing Employee was entitled, prior the Closing Date, to
recognition of such co-payments, deductibles, and similar expenses under any
comparable plan of the Acquired Companies. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " ** _Parent Employee Plan_** " means any (i) "employee benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), (ii) "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), (iii) "employee welfare benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and (iv) any other benefit plan or policy
maintained from time to time by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Company) for the benefit of, or relating to, the employees of Parent
or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) and with respect to which
eligibility has not been frozen prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall pay, or cause to be
paid, to each individual participating in any incentive compensation plan or
program of any of the Acquired Companies for which bonuses have not yet been
paid in respect of the performance period ending on December 31, 2016, a bonus
under each such plan or program based on actual achievement of the performance
goals through a specified date, as determined by the Company in its sole
discretion (but in no event later than the earlier of (x) December 31, 2016
and (y) the Closing Date), which such bonuses shall be payable in the form of
cash and/or equity or equity-based awards, as determined in the good faith
discretion of the Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice (provided that in no event shall such equity or equity-based
awards vest solely as a result of the consummation of the Transactions). For
the performance year ending December 31, 2017, Parent shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) to, provide each Continuing
Employee with equity and nonequity incentive compensation no less favorable to
such Continuing Employee than the equity and non-equity incentive compensation
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, any Company Plan set forth on _Section 5.8(d)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, unless Parent, in its sole and absolute
discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain any such Company Plan by providing
the Company with written notice of such election at least five (5) days before
the Effective Time. Unless Parent so provides notice to the Company in
accordance with the preceding sentence, the Company shall deliver to Parent,
prior to the Closing Date, evidence that the Company Board has validly adopted
resolutions to terminate such Company Plans, effective no later than the date
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) In connection with any termination of the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) Plan (the " **
_Company 401(k) Plan_**") pursuant to _Section 5.8(d)_ or otherwise, Parent
shall permit each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) in cash in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution
portion of the account balance distributed to each such Continuing Employee
from the Company 401(k) Plan to an "eligible retirement plan" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(the " ** _Parent 401(k) Plan_**"). Parent shall take all actions necessary
to cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept rollovers by Continuing Employees
from the Company 401(k) Plan, including participant loans, after the Closing
Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Company to continue any specific employee benefit plans or to
continue the employment of any specific person. Without limiting the
generality of _Section 8.6_, the provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are for
the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) ** **
constitute an amendment or termination of any of the compensation and benefits
plans maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to or following
the Effective Time, (ii) ** ** impede or limit Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any
Company Plan following the Effective Time or (iii) ** ** confer upon or give
to any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee
or any current or former employees, labor unions, directors or independent
contractors (including any representative, beneficiary or dependent thereof)
of any of the Acquired Companies, or on or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto
and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable
or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of the receipt of any written communication
received from any Person alleging that it is or may be required to obtain a
consent of such Person in connection with the Transactions or from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. The delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ shall not (a) cure any breach of, or
non-compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (b) limit the
remedies available to the party sending or receiving such notice.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC agree that all rights to exculpation or
indemnification arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of, acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of any of the Acquired Companies as
provided in their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents shall survive the Merger and the Subsequent Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
For a period of no less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent
shall, shall cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving Company shall,
maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of each Acquired CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation
and bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect as of the date of
this Agreement or under any indemnification agreements of the Acquired
Companies with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in
effect as of the date of this Agreement. None of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Surviving Company shall amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were
current or former directors, officers or employees of any of the Acquired
Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any Action pending
or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Action.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Surviving Company shall, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds
in respect of each of the foregoing and costs of defense to) each current and
former director or officer of any of the Acquired Companies (each, together
with such individualÂ’s heirs, executors or administrators, an " **
_Indemnified Party_** "), in each case against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, costs and expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees and
disbursements), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (collectively,
" ** _Losses_** ") in connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of, relating to
or in connection with the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was an
officer, director or fiduciary of any of the Acquired Companies at or prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification for such expenses. No Indemnified Party shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened
or actual Action for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified
Party hereunder unless Parent consents in writing to such settlement,
compromise or consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) The Company shall obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance and indemnification policies that
provide coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time (the "
** _Continuing D andO Insurance_**") with terms, conditions, retentions,
deductibles and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
CompanyÂ’s existing policy or policies or, if such insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not pay an annual premium for the Continuing DandO Insurance in
excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement (the " ** _Company Â’s Current Premium_**"). If such premiums for
such insurance would at any time exceed 200% of the CompanyÂ’s Current Premium,
then Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in ParentÂ’s good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the CompanyÂ’s
Current Premium.

 



 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets, then, and in each case, Parent and the Surviving Company shall ensure
that such surviving corporation or entity or the transferees of such
properties or assets assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_
**.**

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.10_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of any of the Acquired Companies or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Party with any of the Acquired Companies, in each
case in effect as of the date of this Agreement, or under applicable Law.
These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and the Subsequent
Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required or reasonably
appropriate to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of
Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent
Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company or who will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. Parent and the Company shall provide to counsel to the
other party copies of the resolutions to be adopted by their respective boards
of directors to implement the foregoing.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Law is or may become
applicable to this Agreement (including the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and
the other Transactions), each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger
LLC and their respective boards of directors (or other governing body) shall
grant all such approvals and take all such actions as are reasonably necessary
or appropriate so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act
reasonably to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on such
transactions.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
CompanyÂ’s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly advise the other orally and in writing of any Action commenced after
the date of this Agreement against any Acquired Company or Parent Company, as
applicable, or any of its directors or officers by any stockholder of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions and shall keep the other reasonably informed regarding any
such Action. The Company or Parent, as applicable, shall give the other the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such
stockholder Action, shall give due consideration to the otherÂ’s advice with
respect to such stockholder Action, and the Company shall not settle or offer
to settle any such Action without the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such
settlement is solely for monetary damages entirely paid for with proceeds of
insurance (other than the deductible under insurance policy(ies) in effect as
of the date hereof).

 



 

Section 5.15 _Public Announcements_. Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other
before issuing, and shall provide each other the reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the Merger, the Subsequent Merger and the other Transactions and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to such consultation, except to the extent required by Law, court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or any
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.16 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as provided for in _Section 2.2(c)_,
all stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp, recording and
other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions to any such
Taxes) imposed on the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Company or incurred in connection with this Agreement or any of the
Transactions shall be paid by either the Company or the Surviving Company. The
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of
all Tax Returns, questionnaires or other documents with respect to such Taxes.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and under
the Company Stock Plans to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market
LLC, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.18 _Tax Treatment_.

 



 

(a) Parent, the Company, Merger Sub and Merger LLC intend that the Merger and
the Subsequent Merger, taken together, be treated, and each of them shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together, to be treated, for federal income tax purposes as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent and
the Company are to be parties under Section 368(b) of the Code) in which the
Company is to be treated as merging directly with and into Parent, with the
Company Shares converted in such merger into the right to receive the
consideration provided for hereunder, and each shall file all Tax Returns
consistent with, and take no position inconsistent with, such treatment unless
required to do so by applicable Law. The parties to this Agreement agree to
make such reasonable representations as requested by counsel for the purpose
of rendering the opinions described in _Sections 6.2(d)_ and _6.3(d)_ ,
including representations in the Company Tax Certificate (in the case of the
Company) and in the Parent Tax Certificate (in the case of Parent).

 



 

(b) If there is a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code that the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, do not qualify
as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code, Parent, the
Company, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall take the position for federal income
tax purposes that the Merger was a qualified stock purchase within the meaning
of Section 338 of the Code and the Subsequent Merger qualified as a
liquidation described in Section 332 of the Code.

 



 

(c) Parent, the Company, Merger Sub and Merger LLC hereby adopt this Agreement
as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368- 3(a).

 



 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Company is able to make the
representations in the Company Tax Certificate, assuming the Merger and
Subsequent Merger occurred as of the date of this Agreement, and expects to be
able to make such representations at such time or times as may be reasonably
requested by counsel, including the effective date of the Form S-4 and the
Closing Date, for purposes of rendering the opinions described in _Sections
6.2(d)_ and _6.3(d)_. The Company shall immediately notify Parent, if, at any
time before the Effective Time, the Company becomes aware of any fact or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or impede the
Company from making the representations contained in the Company Tax

 



      
 

 



 

Certificate or (ii) prevent or impede the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together, from being treated as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a)
of the Code.

 



 

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is able to make the
representations in the Parent Tax Certificate, assuming the Merger and
Subsequent Merger occurred as of the date of this Agreement, and expects to be
able to make such representations at such time or times as may be reasonably
requested by counsel, including the effective date of the Form S-4 and the
Closing Date, for purposes of rendering the opinions described in _Sections
6.2(d)_ and _6.3(d)_. Parent shall immediately notify the Company, if, at any
time before the Effective Time, Parent becomes aware of any fact or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or impede Parent
from making the representations contained in the Parent Tax Certificate or
(ii) prevent or impede the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together,
from being treated as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

(f) The Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, furnish to Parent a
certificate meeting the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(c)(3) to the effect that the Company Shares are not a "U.S. real
property interest" within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all such actions as may be necessary to arrange
the Debt Financing on substantially the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letter, including (i) to negotiate and enter into the
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, as necessary, any "flex"
provisions contained in the Fee Letter) by the Closing Date and (ii) to
satisfy or obtain the waiver of, on a timely basis, all conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing in accordance with the terms thereof and to
comply with all of the obligations applicable to Parent pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements related thereto. Parent,
Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Lenders and other Persons to fund the Debt Financing required to consummate
the Merger on the Closing Date. In the event that all conditions to funding
the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied,
Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Lenders and other Persons to fund the Debt Financing required to
consummate the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, pay related fees
and expenses (including paying all commitment fees when due, for repaying or
refinancing the Credit Agreement or other indebtedness of the Company) and
satisfy all requirements applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC
related to or arising out of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby on the date of Closing. Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall give
the Company prompt notice of any breach (or threatened breach) or default (or
threatened default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements related thereto of which any of Parent, Merger Sub or
Merger LLC has become aware or any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter
or such definitive agreements. In the event that any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall use
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain substitute financing as promptly
as practicable in equivalent amounts commitments in respect of other financing
for such portion of the Debt Financing from the same

 



      
 

 



 

or alternative bona fide third-party financing sources on terms no less
favorable to Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC as those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including with respect to the conditions precedent to
funding of such financing that are in the aggregate, in respect of certainty
of funding, are equivalent to (or more favorable to Parent, Merger Sub and
Merger LLC than) the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, to replace the Debt Financing contemplated by such expired, replaced,
terminated or unavailable commitments or agreements, and on terms that do not
make the timely funding of the financing or the satisfaction of the conditions
to obtaining the financing less likely to occur (" ** _Alternative
Financing_** ") and promptly notify the Company of the foregoing. If obtained,
Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of all commitment letters, agreements (including copies of fee
letters ( _provided_ that fees, "market flex" and other economic terms which
do not affect the amount, availability or conditionality of any portion
thereof may be redacted)) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall
have committed to provide Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC with Alternative
Financing, including the definitive agreements related thereto. Parent, Merger
Sub and Merger LLC shall (i) keep the Company reasonably informed of to the
status of their efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and (ii) provide the
Company with final copies of the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter (
_provided_ that fees, "market flex" and other economic terms which do not
affect the amount, availability or conditionality of any portion thereof may
be redacted), and the definitive agreements related thereto or any debt
commitment letter, fee letter and definitive agreements in connection with any
Alternative Financing, if any, and (iii) provide the Company a reasonable
opportunity to review all drafts of the Debt Commitment Letter, any debt
commitment letter in connection with any Alternative Financing and, in each
case, the definitive agreements related thereto and to approve the final
versions of each of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall not, without the CompanyÂ’s prior
written consent, permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related thereto that (w) shall add any condition to obtaining the
funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, (x) shall reasonably be
expected to (i) adversely affect the ability or likelihood of Parent, Merger
Sub and Merger LLC timely consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or the
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to
occur or shall reduce the amount of the Debt Financing or (z) shall adversely
affect the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC to enforce its rights
against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements relating thereto. Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall provide
the Company with prompt written notice of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from the Debt Financing Sources with respect to
any Debt Financing SourcesÂ’ failure or anticipated failure to fund its
commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreements in
connection therewith. Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC shall not release or
consent to the termination of the commitments and obligations of the lenders
under the Debt Commitment Letter other than in accordance with the terms
thereof, nor shall Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC terminate the Debt
Commitment Letter.

 



 

(c) Parent shall have the right to substitute in equivalent amounts
commitments in respect of other financing for all or any portion of the Debt
Financing from the same or alternative bona fide third party financing sources
so long as such alternative sources would not

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably be expected to (i) adversely affect the ability or likelihood of
Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC timely consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) make the timely funding of the Debt
Financing or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing less likely to occur or (iii) adversely affect the ability of
Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC to enforce its rights against other parties
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating thereto
(collectively with the Debt Financing, the " ** _Available Financing_** " it
being understood that for purposes of this _Section 5.19_, for the avoidance
of doubt, Available Financing may include any offering of debt securities or
incurrence of loans). Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives,
including legal and accounting, to provide, in each case at ParentÂ’s sole
expense and on a timely basis, the cooperation reasonably requested by Parent
that is necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or
Alternative Financing (provided that (i) such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Acquired Companies,
(ii) such requested cooperation and information required to be provided by the
Company is limited to information about the Company and its operations and
(iii) neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to prepare
any information, including Required Information, that requires the combination
of information about the Company with any other Person, including the Parent).
Such cooperation shall include:

 



 

(i) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their Debt Financing Sources, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following ParentÂ’s request, with such
pertinent and customary information necessary to syndicate or complete the
underwriting or private placement of Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested in writing by Parent regarding the business, operations, financial
projections and prospects of the Acquired Companies as is customary for
investment grade public companies in connection with the arrangement or
marketing of financings such as the Available Financing;

 



 

(ii) unless the Debt Financing or any Alternative Financing shall have been
fully syndicated or funded prior thereto, (A) furnishing to Parent as promptly
as reasonably practicable, and in no event later than (x) 20 calendar days
after the end of the first three fiscal quarters of any fiscal year of the
Company and 45 calendar days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company,
unaudited balance sheets and income and cash flow statements (in each case
without footnotes) of the Acquired Companies for such fiscal quarter or fiscal
year and (y) 60 calendar days after the end of each fiscal year of the
Company, audited balance sheets and income and cash flow statements of the
Acquired Companies for such fiscal year, in each case, to the extent
reasonably required by Parent to prepare _pro forma_ financial statements of
the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under the
Securities Act to syndicate or complete the offering(s) of debt securities
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or in connection with the Available
Financing and the Transactions; (B) furnishing to Parent as promptly as
reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than 90 calendar days after
the end of each fiscal year of the Company, the audited balance sheets and
income and cash flow statements of the Acquired Companies for the three most
recent fiscal years ended at least 90 days prior to the Closing Date prepared
in accordance with GAAP as

 



      
 

 



 

required by Regulation S-X under the Securities Act; and (C) furnishing to
Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in no event later than 45
calendar days after the end of each subsequent fiscal quarter of the Company
ending at least 45 days prior to the Closing Date (other than the fourth
quarter), unaudited balance sheets and income and cash flow statements (in

arrangements, communications and understandings among the parties and their
respective Affiliates with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof
(except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended as
necessary so that until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1_ hereof, Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC and the Company shall be
permitted to take the actions contemplated by this Agreement).

 



 

Section 8.6 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this
Agreement, except (a) for the provisions of _Article II_ (which, from and
after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of the holders of Company
Shares and Company Stock Awards immediately prior to the Effective Time) and
_Section 5.10_ (which shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties and
their heirs) and (b) the rights of the Debt Financing Sources set forth in
_Sections 8.7(b)_ and _8.8(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Debt
Financing Sources are hereby made express third-party beneficiaries of
_Section 7.4_, this _Section 8.6_ and _Sections 8.10_ and _8.13_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.7 _Governing Law_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the
Transactions, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
shall be governed by the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state, without regard
to the conflicts of law principles of such state to the extent that such
principles would have the effect of applying the laws of, or directing a
matter to, another jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 8.7(a)_, the Company
on behalf of itself and each Company Related Party agrees that, except as
specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all Actions, including
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to any agreement entered into by the
Debt Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules or
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of law of another jurisdiction. The parties hereto
further agree that all of the provisions of _Section 8.13_ relating to waiver
of jury trial shall apply to any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim referenced in this Section _ 8.7(b)_.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any Action with respect to
this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for
recognition and enforcement of any Judgment in respect of this Agreement and
the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto
or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in
the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware). The parties further agree that no party to this
Agreement shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 8.8(a)_, and each party waives any objection to
the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Each
of the parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any Action with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for
any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section
8.8(a)_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts

 



      
 

 



 

(whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment
in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii)
to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) the
Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of
such Action is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub and Merger LLC hereby consents to service being made through the notice
procedures set forth in _Section 8.2_ and agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail (return receipt requested and
first-class postage prepaid) to the respective addresses set forth in _Section
8.2_ shall be effective service of process for any Action in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 8.8(a)_, the Company
on behalf of itself and each Company Related Party (i) agrees that it will not
bring or support any Action, including any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the
Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
any agreement entered into by the Debt Financing Sources in connection with
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (ii)
submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (iii) agrees that service of process,
summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to it at its address
provided in _Section 8.2_ shall be effective service of process against it
for any such action brought in any such court, (iv) waives and hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such
court and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by law. The parties hereto further agree that
all of the provisions of _Section 8.13_ relating to waiver of jury trial
shall apply to any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim referenced in this _Section 8.8(b)_.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, as a whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any
party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Any
purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC

 



      
 

 



 

shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court
of Chancery, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives any
requirement under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
agrees on behalf of itself and each Company Related Party that none of the
Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company
or any Company Related Party relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions (including the Debt Financing). This _Section 8.10(b)_ is
intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Debt Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Currency_. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this
Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision
had never been contained herein, so long as the economic or legal substance of
the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY WITH AND UPON THE ADVICE OF COMPETENT
COUNSEL IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS.

 



 

Section 8.14 _Counterparts; Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. The exchange
of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or
by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind the parties
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.15 _Disclosure Letters_. The Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter are not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as constituting, representations or warranties of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or Merger LLC, except and to the extent expressly provided
in this Agreement. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be

 



      
 

 



 

construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. Inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission that such item is
material or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable. Descriptive headings in the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Parent Disclosure Letter are inserted for reference purposes and for
convenience of the reader only and shall not affect the interpretation thereof
or of this Agreement. Nothing contained in the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission of liability
or responsibility in connection with any pending, threatened or future Action.
