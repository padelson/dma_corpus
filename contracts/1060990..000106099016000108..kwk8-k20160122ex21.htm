for any Assigned Contract are (i) greater than the amount set forth on the
schedule of Cure Costs filed by Sellers with the Bankruptcy Court [D.I. 957]
(together with any amendments, supplements or modifications thereto, the "Cure
Schedule") and (ii) are not consented to by Buyer, then Buyer shall be
permitted, no later than two Business Days after entry of an order by the
Bankruptcy Court setting such Cure Costs, to provide Sellers a Contract Notice
of Buyer's election to revoke its designation of any such Contract as an
Assigned Contract and thereupon such Contract shall be deemed to be an
Excluded Contract for all purposes of this Agreement.

(c) If Buyer exercises its rights in clause (b) above to designate a Contract,
including a Contract that was an Assigned Contract immediately before such
designation, as an Excluded Contract, there shall be no reduction in the
Purchase Price as a result of such designation or change in designation.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall bear and
pay any and all (i) Cure Costs and (ii) costs and liabilities incurred prior
to the Effective Time with respect to the Assigned Contracts listed on
Schedule 2.5(d).

2.6 Assignment of Oil and Gas Assets Subject to Consent Requirements.

If prior to the Closing Date any consent to assignment applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than governmental consents or
approvals customarily obtained post-Closing) has not been obtained, and
further, the document setting forth the need to obtain such consent provides
that such consent may be withheld for any reason or failure to obtain such
third party consent may result in the termination of a Lease, including
causing such to be void or voidable (each such third party consent, a "Hard
Consent"), each Oil and Gas Asset affected by such Hard Consent shall be held
back from the Oil and Gas Assets conveyed at Closing and the Base Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value for such Oil and Gas Assets. Any
Oil and Gas Asset so held back at the Closing will be conveyed to Buyer within
ten Business Days after such Hard Consent has been obtained, waived or
otherwise satisfied. At such subsequent closing, Sellers shall contribute,
assign, transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall acquire and accept from
Seller, such Property pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and Buyer shall
then be obligated for the payment of the Allocated Value attributable to such
Oil and Gas Asset. Except for Hard Consents, if any consents to the assignment
of any Oil and Gas Asset are not obtained prior to Closing, then 

with respect to each affected Oil and Gas Asset, the affected Oil and Gas
Assets shall nevertheless be sold and conveyed to Buyer at the Closing and
Buyer shall pay for the affected Oil and Gas Asset(s) at Closing in accordance
with this Agreement as though the Consent had been obtained. In the case of
licenses, certificates, approvals, authorizations, Leases, Contracts and other
commitments included in the Oil and Gas Assets (i) that cannot be transferred
or assigned without the Hard Consent of third parties, which Hard Consent has
not been obtained prior to the Closing (after giving effect to the Sale Order
and the Bankruptcy Code), Sellers shall, at Buyer's sole expense and subject
to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be required, reasonably
cooperate with Buyer in endeavoring to obtain such Hard Consent and, if any
such Hard Consent is not obtained, Sellers shall, following the Closing, at
Buyer's sole expense and subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that
may be required, cooperate with Buyer in all reasonable respects to provide to
Buyer the benefits thereof in some other manner, or (ii) that are otherwise
not transferable or assignable (after giving effect to the Sale Order and the
Bankruptcy Code), Sellers shall, following the Closing, at Buyer's sole
expense and subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be
required, reasonably cooperate with Buyer to provide to Buyer the benefits
thereof in some other manner (including the exercise of the rights of Sellers
thereunder); provided that nothing in this Section 2.6 shall (x) require
Sellers to make any expenditure or incur any obligation on their own or on
behalf of Buyer for which funds in the full amount of such expenditure or
obligation are not provided to Sellers by Buyer in advance in cash or (y)
prohibit any Seller from ceasing operations or winding up its affairs
following the Closing.

2.7 Further Assurances.

The Parties agree to (a) furnish upon request to each other such further
information, (b) execute, acknowledge and deliver to each other such other
documents, and (c) do such other acts and things, all as the other Party may
reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents; provided that Sellers' covenants and
obligations after Closing shall be limited to the extent Sellers have
employees and resources available for such purposes, and provided further that
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any Seller from ceasing operations or
winding up its affairs following the Closing.

ARTICLE 3 

PURCHASE PRICE

3.1 Purchase Price.

The purchase price for the purchase, sale, assignment and conveyance of
Sellers' right, title and interest in, to and under the Oil and Gas Assets
shall consist of the following (collectively, the "Base Purchase Price"):

(a) cash in an amount equal to Two Hundred and Forty-Five Million Dollars
($245,000,000); and

(b) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
provided in Section 2.6, Section 8.9(b) and Section 8.12 hereof (as adjusted,
the "Purchase Price"). The cash components of the Purchase Price shall be
delivered by Buyer as set forth in Section 4.2. 

3.2 Good Faith Deposit.

(a) As required by the terms of the Bidding Procedures Order, Buyer has
submitted a Good Faith Deposit in the amount of five percent (5%) of the Base
Purchase Price. Within two (2) Business Days after the Sale Order has been
entered by the Bankruptcy Court, Buyer shall increase the Good Faith Deposit
to an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Base Purchase Price. The
Good Faith Deposit shall be held and disbursed by Sellers in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

(b) If the Closing of the sale of the Oil and Gas Assets by Sellers to Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement is not consummated because of a breach of this
Agreement by Buyer resulting in termination pursuant to Section 11.1(c)(i),
then, in such event and assuming that the failure of Buyer is not due to
Sellers' breach of any provision of this Agreement, Sellers shall have the
right to receive the Good Faith Deposit, free of any claims by Buyer thereto,
as liquidated damages due to the difficulty of ascertaining actual damages
with any certainty and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Good Faith Deposit (together with the remedies provided for in Section
11.2(b)) shall be Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy with respect to such
breach by Buyer notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in
Article 11 or elsewhere in this Agreement. The Parties shall cause the payment
of the Good Faith Deposit, together with any interest or other earnings
thereon, to be delivered to Sellers within five (5) Business Days of such
termination, free of any claims by Buyer with respect thereto.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than a breach of this
Agreement by Buyer resulting in termination pursuant to Section 11.1(c)(i),
Buyer shall be reimbursed the Good Faith Deposit, together with any interest
or other earnings thereon. The Parties shall cause the reimbursement of the
Good Faith Deposit to be delivered to Buyer within five (5) Business Days of
such termination, free of any claims by Sellers with respect thereto.

ARTICLE 7 

ACTIONS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE

7.1 Access and Reports.

(a) Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, upon receipt of written notice
from Buyer of any such activities no less than two Business Days in advance,
Sellers shall (and shall cause their Subsidiaries to) afford Buyer's
authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
until the date that is five Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date,
to its employees, properties, books, Contracts and Records, and, during such
period, Sellers shall furnish promptly to Buyer all information concerning the
Oil and Gas Assets as may reasonably be requested; provided, however, such
access shall not interfere with the ordinary conduct of business or the
operation of the Oil and Gas Assets and at all times during such access,
Buyer's authorized Representatives shall be accompanied by at least one
Representative of Sellers. All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 7.1 shall be submitted in accordance with Section 13.4. All such
information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
No investigation pursuant to this Section 7.1 or by Buyer or its
Representatives at any time prior to or following the date hereof shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Sellers
herein.

(b) From and after the execution of this Agreement until the date that is five
Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, Buyer shall have the right,
at its sole cost, risk, liability, and expense, to conduct a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment of the Oil and Gas Assets. During the Company's
regular hours of business and after providing the Company with written notice
of any such activities no less than two Business Days in advance (which
written notice shall include the written permission of the operator (if other
than a Seller) and any other third party whose permission is legally required,
which Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in securing), Buyer and its
authorized Representatives shall be permitted to enter upon the Oil and Gas
Assets, inspect the same, review all of Sellers' files and records (other than
those for which any Seller has an attorney-client privilege) relating to the
Oil and Gas Assets, and generally conduct visual, non-invasive tests,
examinations, and investigations; provided, however, that such entry shall not
interfere with the ordinary conduct of business or operation of the Oil and
Gas Assets and at all times during such entry, Buyer's authorized
Representatives shall be accompanied by at least one Representative of
Sellers. No sampling or other invasive inspections of the Oil and Gas Assets
may be conducted without the Company's prior written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld. The withholding of consent to sampling or any other
invasive inspection by the Company shall be deemed reasonable if (without
limitation) the need for such sampling or invasive testing was not indicated
from a visual inspection or, based on the Phrase I Environmental Assessment.
Sellers will have the right, which they may exercise at their sole discretion,
to (i) observe such investigation, and (ii) promptly receive a copy of all
results, analyses, reports, and reviews, except for such information for which
Buyer has an attorney-client privilege. All information obtained or reviewed
by Buyer shall be maintained confidential by Buyer and shall be governed by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) This Section 7.1 shall not require Sellers to permit any access to, or to
disclose (i) any information that, in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, 

which may be in-house counsel) of the Company, is reasonably likely to result
in any violation of any Legal Requirement or any Contract to which the Company
or any other Seller is a party or cause any privilege (including attorney-
client privilege) that Sellers would be entitled to assert to be undermined
with respect to such information and such undermining of such privilege could
in the Company's good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel) adversely affect in any material respect Sellers'
position in any pending or, what the Company believes in good faith (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) if the Company or any other Seller, on the one hand, and
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation, any information that is reasonably pertinent thereto; provided,
that, in the case of clause (i), the Parties shall cooperate in seeking to
find a way to allow disclosure of such information to the extent doing so (A)
would not (in the good faith belief of the Company (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be reasonably likely to result in the
violation of any such Legal Requirement or Contract or be reasonably likely to
cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or (B)
could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Company (after consultation
with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of Buyer could be provided access to such information.

(d) The information provided pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall be used solely
for the purpose of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
information shall be kept confidential by Buyer and Sellers in accordance
with, and Buyer and Sellers shall otherwise abide by and be subject to the
terms and conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement.

(e) BUYER SHALL DEFEND, RELEASE, INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS EACH SELLER PARTY
FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES THAT ANY BUYER PARTY MAY ASSERT
AGAINST ANY SELLER PARTY, BASED UPON INJURY TO PERSON, INCLUDING DEATH, OR TO
PROPERTY, ARISING IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER FROM ANY INSPECTION BY ANY BUYER
PARTY OF THE OIL AND GAS ASSETS AND ACCESS BY ANY BUYER PARTY TO THE OIL AND
GAS ASSETS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE, WHETHER OR NOT BASED UPON STRICT
LIABILITY OR CAUSED BY THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER ACTIVE OR
PASSIVE) OF ANY SELLER PARTY, UNLESS SUCH INJURY WAS OCCASIONED SOLELY BY THE
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL TORT OF ANY SELLER PARTY.

7.2 Operations Prior to the Closing Date.

Sellers covenant and agree that, except (v) as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, (w) as disclosed in Schedule 7.2, (x) with the prior written
consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) and (y) as otherwise required by Legal Requirements,
after the Effective Time and prior to the Closing Date:

(a) Sellers shall:

(i) use commercially reasonable efforts, taking into account Sellers' status
as debtors in possession, to maintain and operate the Oil and Gas Assets that
are 

operated by any Seller as a reasonably prudent operator or cause such Oil and
Gas Assets to be operated as a reasonably prudent operator in the ordinary
course of business;

(ii) pay or cause to be paid all bonuses and rentals, royalties, overriding
royalties, shut-in royalties, and minimum royalties and development and
operating expenses, and other payments incurred with respect to the Oil and
Gas Assets operated by any Seller except (A) royalties held in suspense as a
result of title issues and that do not give any third party a right to cancel
an interest in any Oil and Gas Assets operated by any Seller, and (B) expenses
or royalties being contested in good faith, if Sellers notify Buyer and obtain
Buyer's approval prior to withholding such payment;

(iii) maintain their books, accounts and records in accordance with past
custom and practice;

(iv) maintain the personal property comprising part of the Oil and Gas Assets
operated by any Seller in at least as good a condition as it is on the date
hereof, subject to ordinary wear and tear;

(v) use commercially reasonable efforts, taking into account Sellers' status
as debtors in possession, to (A) retain Company employees who are in good
standing and are either necessary to conduct the business as it is currently
being conducted and (B) maintain their relationships with and preserve the
goodwill of their key service providers; and

(vi) perform all other land and accounting services as would a reasonably
prudent operator to maintain the Oil and Gas Assets.

(b) Sellers shall not:

(i) abandon any Oil and Gas Asset (except any abandonment of Leases to the
extent any such Leases terminate pursuant to their terms);

(ii) commence, propose, or agree to participate in any single operation with
respect to the Wells or Assigned Leases and Interests with an anticipated cost
in excess of $50,000, except for emergency operations, operations scheduled
under the AFEs, or operations required by any Governmental Authority;

(iii) terminate, cancel, or materially amend or modify any Assigned Contract
or Assigned Lease and Interest;

(iv) sell, lease, encumber, or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of any
Oil and Gas Assets, except sales of Hydrocarbons in the ordinary course of
business; or

(v) enter into any agreement or commitment to take any action prohibited by
this Section 7.2(b).

7.3 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

(a) Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions 

contemplated hereby, including using commercially reasonable efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to
cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article 9 and Article 10 to be
satisfied, (ii) the obtaining, at the earliest practicable date, of all
necessary Governmental Authorizations and the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations
and filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any Proceeding by any
Governmental Authority, and (iii) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, (i) shall promptly
inform each other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
concerning this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, and any
filing, notification or request for approval and (ii) shall permit the other
to review in advance any proposed written or material oral communication or
information submitted to any such Governmental Authority in response thereto.
In addition, none of Parties shall agree to participate in any meeting with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, unless such Party consults with the other Parties in advance and, to
the extent permitted by any such Governmental Authority, gives the other
Parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, in each case to the
maximum extent practicable. Subject to any restrictions under applicable laws,
rules or regulations, each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the
other hand, shall furnish the other with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
it and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives on the one hand,
and the Governmental Authority or members of its staff on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (excluding
documents and communications which are subject to preexisting confidentiality
agreements or to the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine) or
any such filing, notification or request for approval. Each Party shall also
furnish the other Party with such necessary information and assistance as such
other Party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their
preparation of necessary filings, registration or submissions of information
to the Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby and any such filing, notification or request
for approval.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall take
any and all commercially reasonable steps necessary to avoid or eliminate any
impediments under any applicable antitrust, competition or trade regulation
laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
as may be required in order to avoid the entry, or to effect the dissolution,
of any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing, delaying or
restricting the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement.

7.4 Bankruptcy Court Approval.

(a) Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that this Agreement and the sale of the Oil
and Gas Assets and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts and
Assigned 

Leases and Interests and the rejection of the Rejected Contracts are subject
to Bankruptcy Court approval. Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that (i) to obtain
such approval, Sellers must demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps
to obtain the highest and otherwise best offer possible for the Oil and Gas
Assets, and that such demonstration shall include giving notice of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to creditors and other interested
parties as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, and (ii) Buyer must provide
adequate assurance of future performance under the to-be-assigned Leases and
executory Contracts.

(b) In the event an appeal is taken or a stay pending appeal is requested,
from the Sale Order, Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer of such appeal or
stay request and shall provide to Buyer promptly a copy of the related notice
of appeal or order of stay. Sellers shall also provide Buyer with written
notice of any motion or application filed in connection with any appeal from
either of such orders.

(c) From and after the date of execution of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1,
Sellers shall not take any action which is intended to (or is reasonably
likely to), or fail to take any action the intent (or the reasonably likely
result) of which failure to act is to, result in the reversal, voiding,
modification or staying of the Sale Order or this Agreement.

(d) Sellers shall, prior to the Closing Date, cause the Contracts listed on
Schedule 7.4(d) (the "Rejected Contracts") to be rejected pursuant to a Final
Order of the Bankruptcy Court.

7.5 Bankruptcy Filings.

From and after the date of execution of this Agreement and until the Closing
Date, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer
copies of all pleadings, motions, notices, statements, schedules,
applications, reports and other papers that relate, in whole or in part, to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or to Buyer or their
respective agents or representatives, that are to be filed by the Sellers in
the Bankruptcy Case in advance of their filing, in each case, if reasonably
practicable under the circumstances before the filing of such papers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Sellers' inadvertent failure to comply
with this Section 7.5, nor Sellers' failure to comply with this Section 7.5
due to emergency circumstances, shall constitute a breach under this
Agreement.

7.6 Updates and Amendments of Exhibits and Schedules.

Until the third Business Day before Closing, Sellers may amend, modify and/or
supplement Exhibit A, Exhibit C, Exhibit D (subject to Section 2.5), Exhibit
E, Schedule 2.2(h) and Schedule 2.2(i), in each case, as applicable, in order
to reflect (i) any additional Contracts or Leases taken by any Seller or (ii)
the deletion of any Contracts or Leases from any such Exhibit or Schedule,
subject in each case above to the approval of Buyer, in its sole discretion.

7.7 Financial Information. From and after the date of execution of this
Agreement and until the Closing Date, upon reasonable request from Buyer,
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with
financial information about the Oil and Gas Assets or Sellers, as applicable,
for purposes of assisting Buyer to satisfy Buyer's anticipated securities law
reporting obligations. Without limiting the foregoing, Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable 

efforts to provide other material financial accounting information possessed
by Sellers related to the Oil and Gas Assets for the six (6) year period
preceding the Closing. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Buyer in obtaining any necessary consents for the delivery of such
information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section
7.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall obligate Sellers to have their 2015
financial statements audited by an independent accounting firm or require
Sellers to obtain consents to disclose their audited financial statements from
any prior year.

7.8 Commitment Letter.

Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has delivered to Sellers a
true and complete, fully-executed copy of the equity commitment letter (the
"Commitment Letter") by and between Buyer and NGP X US Holdings, L.P. ("NGP"),
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, NGP has
agreed and committed to provide to Buyer the equity financing set forth
therein ("Financing"). Buyer shall not take any action that could result in
the commitments in the Commitment Letter being withdrawn, modified or
rescinded in any respect, including authorizing any amendment or waiver of any
provision in the Commitment Letter in a manner that would reduce, limit or
place any additional contingency on the Financing or otherwise limit the
availability of the Financing, without the prior consent of Sellers. On or
before the Closing Date, Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable, and
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and assist
Buyer, to consummate and obtain the Financing (a) on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letter, or (b) pursuant to any other alternative
financing arrangement in an amount not less than the amount covered by the
Commitment Letter.

7.9 Cooperation with Financing.

Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in
connection with the arrangement of financing for Buyer relating to its
purchase of the Oil and Gas Assets.

7.10 Sellers' Escrow Amount.

Within two (2) Business Days after the Sale Order has been entered by the
Bankruptcy Court, Sellers shall place into escrow with an escrow agent
proposed by Sellers and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer the sum of fifteen
million dollars ($15,000,000) (the "Sellers' Escrow Amount") and such funds
shall be held in escrow pursuant to a mutually agreeable escrow agreement (the
"Sellers' Escrow Agreement") until the earlier of (a) the Closing, at which
time the Parties shall deliver joint written instructions to the escrow agent
to release the Sellers' Escrow Amount to Sellers, and (b) the release of all
or a portion of the Sellers' Escrow Amount in accordance with Section 11.2(c).



ARTICLE 8 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

8.1 Taxes. 

(a) Any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the "Transfer Taxes") shall be borne by Buyer. Sellers and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to exempt the sale
and transfer of the Oil and Gas Assets from any Transfer Taxes, including
under Section 1146(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. Buyer will, at its own expense,
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable law, the Parties will, and will
cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation.

(b) Sellers shall retain responsibility for, and shall bear and pay, all ad
valorem, property, excise, severance, production or similar Taxes based upon
operation or ownership of the Oil and Gas Assets or the production of
Hydrocarbons or the receipt of proceeds therefrom (but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, income taxes, franchise taxes and Transfer Taxes)
(collectively, the "Asset Taxes") assessed with respect to the Oil and Gas
Assets for (i) any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date. For
purposes of allocation between the Parties of Asset Taxes assessed with
respect to the Oil and Gas Assets that are payable with respect to any tax
periods beginning before and ending after the Closing Date ("Straddle
Periods"), the portion of any such taxes that are attributable to the portion
of the Straddle Period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date shall (i) in
the case of such Asset Taxes that are based upon or related to income or
receipts or imposed on a transactional basis such as severance or production
taxes, be allocated based on revenues from sales occurring on or before the
Closing Date (which shall be Sellers' responsibility) and from and after the
Closing Date (which shall be Buyer's responsibility); and (ii) in the case of
other Asset Taxes, be allocated pro rata per day between the period on or
prior to the Closing Date (which shall be Sellers' responsibility) and the
period after the Closing Date (which shall be Buyer's responsibility). For
purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction,
credit or other item that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated
pro rata per day between the period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and
the period beginning at the Closing Date. At the Closing, Asset Taxes with
respect to each Asset for the applicable Straddle Period shall be prorated in
accordance with the foregoing provisions based on the Asset Tax assessment for
such Asset for such Straddle Period, if available, or if otherwise, based on
the Asset Taxes paid with respect to such Asset during the preceding Tax
period. With respect to any not yet delinquent Taxes relating to a Tax year
ending after the Closing Date, Buyer will assume responsibility for the actual
payment of all such Taxes to the applicable Governmental Authority. With
respect to any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period or Pre-Closing Tax Period
that are delinquent as of the Closing Date, the amount of which is known and
not subject to dispute, Buyer shall pay the delinquent amount of such Taxes
directly to the applicable Governmental Authority at the Closing.

(c) Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, as the case may be
(the "Reimbursing Party"), shall provide reimbursement for any Tax paid by the
other (the "Paying Party") all or a portion of which is the responsibility of
the Reimbursing Party in accordance with the terms of this Section 8.1 or
which represents an overpayment for Taxes by the Paying Party. Within a
reasonable time prior to the payment of any such Tax, the Paying Party shall
give notice to the Reimbursing Party of the Tax payable and the Paying Party's
and Reimbursing Party's 

respective Liability therefor, although failure to do so will not relieve the
Reimbursing Party from its Liability hereunder except to the extent the
Reimbursing Party is prejudiced thereby. Any amounts which may become payable
from any Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(a) shall constitute a super
priority administrative expense of Sellers under Section 364(c)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code with priority over any and all administrative expenses of the
kind specified in Sections 503(b) or 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

(d) Buyer and Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to the Oil and Gas Assets (including access to books and records and
Tax Returns and related working papers dated before Closing) as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election
relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority, the
prosecution or defense of any claims, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax,
and the claiming by Buyer of any federal, state or local business tax credits
or incentives that Buyer may qualify for in any of the jurisdictions in which
any of the Oil and Gas Assets are located; provided, however, that neither
Buyer nor any Seller shall be required to disclose the contents of its income
Tax Returns to any Person. Any expenses incurred in furnishing such
information or assistance pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) shall be borne by
the Party requesting it.

8.2 Allocation of Purchase Price.

The Base Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Oil and Gas Assets as set
forth in Schedule 8.2 hereto, and the portion of the Purchase Price allocated
to each Oil and Gas Asset is referred to herein as the "Allocated Value" of
such Oil and Gas Asset. Sellers and Buyer agree to be bound by the Allocated
Values set forth in Schedule 8.2 for purposes of this Agreement. Sellers and
Buyer further agree that for the purpose of making the requisite filings under
Section 1060 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, the Purchase Price
and any liabilities assumed by Buyer under this Agreement that are treated as
consideration for Tax purposes shall be allocated among the Oil and Gas Assets
in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values, as set forth on Schedule 8.2
(the "Tax Allocation"). Sellers and Buyer each agree to report, and to cause
their respective Affiliates to report, the federal, state and local income and
other Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated herein, and in
particular to report the information required by Section 1060(b) of the Code,
and to jointly prepare Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement under Section
1060 of the Code) as promptly as possible following the Closing Date and in a
manner consistent with the Tax Allocation as revised to take into account
subsequent adjustments to the Base Purchase Price, including any adjustments
pursuant to the Agreement to determine the Purchase Price, and shall not take
any position inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax return, in any
refund claim, in any litigation, investigation, or otherwise, unless required
to do so by any Legal Requirement after notice to and discussions with the
other Party, or with such other Party's prior consent; provided, however, that
nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Sellers from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or
arising out of the Tax Allocation, and neither Buyer nor Sellers shall be
required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Governmental Authority challenging the Tax Allocation.

8.3 Bulk Sales. 

Buyer and Sellers hereby waive compliance with all "bulk sales," "bulk
transfer" and similar laws that may otherwise be applicable with respect to
the sale and transfer of any or all of the Oil and Gas Assets to Buyer.

8.4 Payments Received.

Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, each agree that, after
the Closing, each will hold and will promptly transfer and deliver to the
other, from time to time as and when received by them, any cash, checks with
appropriate endorsements (using their best efforts not to convert such checks
into cash) or other property that they may receive on or after the Closing
which properly belongs to the other and will account to the other for all such
receipts.

8.5 Assigned Contracts and Assigned Leases and Interests: Adequate Assurance
and Performance; Security Arrangements.

(a) With respect to each Assigned Contract and Assigned Lease and Interest,
Buyer shall provide adequate assurance as required under the Bankruptcy Code
of the future performance by Buyer of each such Assigned Contract or Assigned
Lease and Interest. Buyer and Sellers agree that they will promptly take all
actions reasonably required to assist in obtaining a Bankruptcy Court finding
that there has been an adequate demonstration of adequate assurance of future
performance under the Assigned Contracts and the Assigned Leases and
Interests, such as furnishing timely requested and factually accurate
affidavits, non-confidential financial information and other documents or
information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court and making Buyer's and
Sellers' employees and Representatives available to testify before the
Bankruptcy Court.

(b) Buyer shall pay, perform or satisfy the Assumed Liabilities from time to
time and as such Assumed Liabilities become due and payable or are required to
be performed or satisfied in accordance with their respective terms.

(c) Without limiting the provisions of Section 8.5(a), Buyer acknowledges that
the bonds, surety bonds, letters of credit, guarantees, and/or cash deposits,
set forth on Schedule 8.5(c) (collectively the "Security Arrangements") have
been provided by Sellers and/or its Affiliates to secure the payment and/or
performance of certain of Sellers' obligations related to the Oil and Gas
Assets. Buyer acknowledges that Sellers have no duty to maintain any Security
Arrangements after the Closing. To the extent Sellers and/or any of their
Affiliates have any obligations pursuant to any Security Arrangement or have
pledged or otherwise provided any property that secures any such Security
Arrangement (collectively, the "Sellers' Obligations"), Buyer shall take such
actions, during the Straddle Period, as are necessary to cause the Sellers'
Obligations arising under the Security Arrangements set forth on Schedule
8.5(c) (and such Security Arrangements) to be released and terminated, and any
of Sellers' property pledged or otherwise provided to secure such Security
Arrangements returned to the Sellers, concurrent with the Closing.

8.6 Employee Matters.

(a) Employees. Within two (2) Business Days from the date of this Agreement,
Sellers and their Subsidiaries shall send WARN notices to all of Sellers' and
their Subsidiaries' U.S. employees. Buyer shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to offer employment to such U.S. employees of Sellers and their
Subsidiaries as determined by Buyer on terms and 

conditions determined by Buyer. Employees offered employment by Buyer who
accept such employment shall be "Buyer Employees". Sellers consent to Buyer
conducting discussions with the U.S. employees of Sellers and their
Subsidiaries regarding employment. Sellers and their Subsidiaries agree to
continue to employ each of their U.S. employees who do not become Buyer
Employees, excluding any employees that voluntarily separate from employment
with Sellers or their Subsidiaries, for sixty (60) days following the date on
which WARN notices are sent pursuant to this Section 8.6(a) or shall provide
compensation and benefits in lieu of such notice to those U.S. employees
during that time period.

(b) WARN Act. Sellers shall have responsibility for any Liability under the
WARN Act with respect to Sellers' and their Subsidiaries' employees relating
to any act or omission occurring prior to or on the Closing Date, regardless
of when a claim for any such Liabilities under the WARN Act is brought. For
all periods of time prior to, on and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall have
no responsibility for any Liability under the WARN Act, with respect to
Sellers' and their Subsidiaries' employees who do not become Buyer Employees.
Buyer shall have responsibility for any Liability under the WARN Act with
respect to Buyer Employees, relating to any act or omission of Buyer occurring
after the Closing Date.

8.7 Post-Closing Books and Records and Personnel.

For five years after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be
required by any Governmental Authority or ongoing claim), (a) Buyer shall not
dispose of or destroy any of the Records received by Buyer as Oil and Gas
Assets and (b) Buyer shall allow Sellers (including, for clarity, any trust
established under a chapter 11 plan of Sellers or any other successors of
Sellers) and any of their directors, officers, employees, counsel,
representatives, accountants and auditors reasonable access during normal
business hours, at Sellers' sole expense and upon reasonable advance notice,
to all employees and files of Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries and any
Records included in the Oil and Gas Assets for purposes relating to the
Bankruptcy Case, the wind-down of the operations of Sellers, the functions of
any such trusts or successors, or other reasonable business purposes, and
Sellers (including any such trust or successors) and such directors, officers,
employees, counsel, representatives, accountants and auditors shall have the
right to make copies of any such files, books, records and other materials.
Until the closing of the Bankruptcy Case or the liquidation and winding up of
Sellers' estates, Sellers shall preserve and keep the Records and, at Buyer's
sole expense, shall make such Records, and Sellers' personnel available to
Buyer as may be reasonably required by Buyer in connection with, among other
things, any insurance claims by, Proceedings, Actions or Tax audits against,
or governmental investigations of, Buyer or any of its Affiliates or in order
to enable Buyer to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and each
other Transaction Document. In addition, Sellers shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining any necessary consents from
Sellers' independent auditors, in the event Buyer requests such assistance in
connection with any anticipated securities law obligations of Buyer. In the
event any Party desires to destroy any such Records during or after the time
during which they must be maintained pursuant to this Section 8.7, such Party
shall first give ninety days prior written notice to the other Parties and any
such other Parties shall have the right at their option and expense, upon
prior written notice given within such ninety day period to the Party desiring
to destroy such Records or records, to take possession of the Records within
one hundred and eighty days after the date of such notice, or such shorter
period as the liquidation and winding up of Sellers' estates shall permit. 

8.8 No Other Representations or Warranties; Disclaimers.

(a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
EXCEPT AS AND TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, SELLERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
WHATSOEVER, AND DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY
REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, STATEMENT OR INFORMATION MADE OR COMMUNICATED
(ORALLY OR IN WRITING) TO BUYER (INCLUDING ANY OPINION, INFORMATION, OR ADVICE
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO BUYER BY ANY RESPECTIVE AFFILIATE OR
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY SELLER OR BY ANY INVESTMENT BANK OR INVESTMENT BANKING
FIRM, ANY PETROLEUM ENGINEER OR ENGINEERING FIRM, COMPANY'S COUNSEL, OR ANY
OTHER AGENT, CONSULTANT, OR REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY SELLER). WITHOUT LIMITING
THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, EXCEPT AS AND TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, SELLERS EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIM AND NEGATE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, AT
COMMON LAW, BY STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE, RELATING TO (A) THE TITLE TO ANY OF THE
OIL AND GAS ASSETS, (B) THE CONDITION OF THE OIL AND GAS ASSETS (INCLUDING ANY
IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, OR CONFORMITY TO MODELS OR SAMPLES OF MATERIALS), IT BEING DISTINCTLY
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE OIL AND GAS ASSETS ARE BEING SOLD "AS IS," "WHERE IS," AND
"WITH ALL FAULTS AS TO ALL MATTERS," (C) ANY INFRINGEMENT BY SELLERS OF ANY
PATENT OR PROPRIETARY RIGHT OF ANY THIRD PARTY, (D) ANY INFORMATION, DATA, OR
OTHER MATERIALS (WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL) FURNISHED TO BUYER BY OR ON BEHALF
OF SELLERS (INCLUDING, IN RESPECT OF ANY SEISMIC DATA, THE EXISTENCE OR EXTENT
OF HYDROCARBONS OR THE MINERAL RESERVES, THE RECOVERABILITY OF SUCH RESERVES,
ANY PRODUCT PRICING ASSUMPTIONS, AND THE ABILITY TO SELL HYDROCARBON
PRODUCTION AFTER THE CLOSING), AND (E) THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION AND OTHER
CONDITION OF THE OIL AND GAS ASSETS AND ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY ARISING FROM
OR RELATED TO THE OIL AND GAS ASSETS.

(b) Buyer acknowledges and affirms that it has made its own independent
investigation, analysis, and evaluation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and the Oil and Gas Assets (including Buyer's own estimate and
appraisal of the extent and value of Sellers' Hydrocarbon reserves
attributable to the Oil and Gas Assets and an independent assessment and
appraisal of the environmental risks associated with the acquisition of the
Oil and Gas Assets). Buyer acknowledges that in entering into this Agreement,
it has relied only on the aforementioned investigation and the express
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents. Buyer hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from,
directly or indirectly, asserting any claim, or commencing, instituting, or
causing to be commenced, any Proceeding of any kind against Sellers or their
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, alleging facts contrary to the foregoing
acknowledgment and affirmation. 

8.9 Casualty.

(a) If, after the date of execution of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing, a material part of the Oil and Gas Assets suffers a Casualty Loss or
if a material part of the Oil and Gas Assets is taken in condemnation or under
the right of eminent domain or if proceedings for such purposes are pending or
threatened, Sellers shall promptly give Buyer written notice of such
occurrence, including reasonable particulars with respect thereto, and this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any such
destruction, taking, proceeding, or threat.

(b) With regard to a Casualty Loss or condemnation occurring after the date of
execution of this Agreement and prior to the Closing, Buyer may elect to
exclude the affected Oil and Gas Assets from this Agreement, whereupon the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the Allocated Value of the
affected Oil and Gas Assets, and the affected Oil and Gas Assets shall be
treated as Excluded Assets for all purposes under this Agreement.

(c) Unless the Oil and Gas Assets affected by a Casualty Loss are excluded
pursuant to Section 8.9(b), (i) at the Closing, the Oil and Gas Assets
affected by a Casualty Loss or condemnation shall be included in the Closing
and Buyer shall pay the full Allocated Value therefor, subject to any
applicable adjustments under this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer's recourse with
respect to a condemnation or Casualty Loss shall be limited to the proceeds of
Sellers' applicable insurance coverage actually recovered by Sellers in
respect thereof or other sums paid to Sellers by third parties (or an
assignment of claims related thereto), which proceeds or other sums shall be
payable to Buyer only upon or after the Closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Sellers shall have no other liability or responsibility
to Buyer with respect to a condemnation or Casualty Loss, EVEN IF SUCH
CASUALTY LOSS SHALL HAVE RESULTED FROM OR SHALL HAVE ARISEN OUT OF THE SOLE OR
CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, FAULT, OR VIOLATION OF A LEGAL REQUIREMENT (BUT NOT THE
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF SELLERS OR ANY SELLER PARTIES).

(d) Unless the affected Oil and Gas Assets are excluded pursuant to Section
8.9(b), (i) no insurance or condemnation proceeds shall be committed or
applied by any Seller to repair, restore or replace a lost, damaged, destroyed
or taken portion of the Oil and Gas Assets if the cost to repair, restore or
replace a lost, damaged, destroyed or taken portion of the Oil and Gas Assets
is projected to exceed $50,000, (ii) to the extent such proceeds are not
committed or applied by any such Seller prior to the Closing Date in
accordance with this Section 8.9(d), Sellers shall at the Closing pay to Buyer
all sums paid to Sellers by reason of such loss, damage, destruction or
taking, less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Sellers in
collecting such proceeds, (iii) in addition and to the extent such proceeds
have not been committed or applied by Sellers in accordance with this Section
8.9(d), in such repair, restoration, or replacement, Sellers shall transfer to
Buyer, at the Closing, without recourse against Sellers, all of the right,
title, and interest of Sellers in and to any unpaid insurance or condemnation
proceeds arising out of such loss, damage, destruction or taking, less any
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Sellers in collecting such proceeds,
and (iv) any such funds that have been committed by Sellers for repair,
restoration or replacement as aforesaid shall be paid by Sellers for such
purposes or, at Sellers' option, delivered to Buyer upon Sellers' receipt from
Buyer of adequate assurance and indemnity that Sellers shall incur no
liability or expense as a result of such commitment.

8.10 Successor Operator. 

Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to support Buyer's
efforts to be appointed or to have a designee appointed as the successor
operator of those Oil and Gas Assets governed by joint operating agreements
included within the Assigned Contracts that any Seller currently operates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers make no representations or warranties
to Buyer as to the transferability of operatorship of any Oil and Gas Assets
which any Seller currently operates. Rights and obligations associated with
operatorship of the Oil and Gas Assets are governed by operating agreements or
similar agreements and will be determined in accordance with the terms of such
agreements.

8.11 Preferential Purchase Rights.

(a) Within two Business Days after the Sale Order is entered, Sellers shall
deliver to each holder of a Preferential Purchase Right a notice that is in
material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable thereto,
offering to sell to each such holder the applicable Oil and Gas Assets subject
to such Preferential Purchase Right in exchange for an amount not less than
the Allocated Value of such Oil and Gas Asset, or, alternatively, seeking such
holder's consent to the assignment of the applicable Oil and Gas Assets to
Buyer; it being understood and agreed by the Parties that Sellers shall not be
obligated to make any payments or undertake obligations in connection with the
obtaining of such consents.

(b) If any Preferential Purchase Right is exercised prior to the Closing, or
if the time frame for the exercise of such Preferential Purchase Right has not
expired as of Closing and Sellers have not received a waiver of such
Preferential Purchase Right, then that portion of the Oil and Gas Assets
affected by such Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Oil
and Gas Assets at Closing and the Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such excluded Oil and
Gas Asset(s).

(c) If a third person exercises its Preferential Purchase Right, but does not
consummate the transaction within the time frame specified in the instrument
giving rise to such Preferential Purchase Right (provided that the reason
therefor is not Sellers' default), or such instrument does not provide a time
frame for consummating such transaction, then, no later than the 10th business
day after such time frame expires, or the ninetieth day after Closing if the
underlying instrument does not provide a time frame for consummating such
transaction, (A) Sellers shall transfer the applicable retained Oil and Gas
Asset(s) to Buyer by execution and delivery of an instrument of conveyance in
substantially the form of the Assignment, such conveyance to be effective as
of the Effective Date, and (B) contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of such conveyance, Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount by which
the Base Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to such retained
Oil and Gas Asset(s).

(d) If a Preferential Purchase Right is not discovered prior to Closing, the
affected Oil and Gas Asset(s) is conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and such
Preferential Purchase Right is validly exercised by the holder thereof after
Closing, then Buyer (A) agrees to convey such affected Oil and Gas Asset(s) to
the person exercising such Preferential Purchase Right on the same terms and
conditions under which Sellers conveyed such Asset(s) to Buyer (with the
purchase price for such Asset(s) being the Allocated Value of the affected Oil
and Gas Asset(s)) and (B) shall be entitled to retain all amounts paid by the
person exercising such Preferential Purchase Right. In the event of such
exercise, Buyer shall prepare, execute and deliver a form of conveyance of
such 

Oil and Gas Asset(s) to such exercising person, such conveyance to be in
substantially the form of the Assignment.

(e) All Oil and Gas Assets for which any applicable Preferential Purchase
Right has been waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable
Preferential Purchase Right has expired without the exercise thereof, in each
case, prior to Closing, shall be transferred to Buyer at Closing pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement.

8.12 Accounting Adjustments for Revenues and Expenses.

(a) The Base Purchase Price shall be increased by the following (without
duplication): (i) an amount equal to the value of all merchantable allowable
oil or other liquid Hydrocarbons in storage owned by Sellers above custody
transfer point at the Effective Time that is credited to the Oil and Gas
Assets, such value to be the current market price or the price paid, less
Taxes and gravity adjustments deducted by the purchaser of such oil or other
liquid Hydrocarbons; (ii) an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all costs
and expenses paid in connection with the ownership, development, production,
operation, and maintenance of the Oil and Gas Assets (including rentals,
overhead, royalties, Taxes, and other charges, including overhead charges and
other indirect costs and expenses billed under applicable operating agreements
or governmental statute(s)) which are properly paid by or on behalf of
Sellers, are not subject to reimbursement to Sellers pursuant to a joint
interest billing and are attributable to the period on or after the Effective
Time; and (iii) any other amount provided elsewhere in this Agreement or
agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers.

(b) The Base Purchase Price shall be decreased by the following (without
duplication): (i) the amount of any proceeds actually received by Sellers from
the (A) sale of Hydrocarbons, produced from and after the Effective Time, from
the Oil and Gas Assets (net of royalties and other burdens; and production,
severance and similar Taxes and assessments measured by or payable out of
production; provided, that (x) on oil the amount shall be the amount paid by
the purchaser to Sellers and (y) to the extent such a netting is made, Sellers
shall retain the obligation to pay the netted amounts to the Persons to whom
such amounts are due); and (B) the rental, sale, salvage, or other disposition
of any Oil and Gas Asset after the Effective Time; (ii) other income from or
attributable to the Oil and Gas Assets from and after the Effective Time
received by Sellers; (iii) reductions to the Base Purchase Price for Hard
Consents pursuant to Section 2.6; (iv) reductions to the Base Purchase Price
for Casualty Losses pursuant to Section 8.9; (v) reductions to the Base
Purchase Price for Preferential Purchase Rights pursuant to Section 8.11; (vi)

connection with the ownership, development, production, operation, and
maintenance of the Oil and Gas Assets (including rentals, overhead, royalties,
Taxes, and other charges, including overhead charges and other indirect costs
and expenses billed under applicable operating agreements or governmental
statute(s)) which are properly paid by or on behalf of Buyer, are not subject
to reimbursement to Buyer pursuant to a joint interest billing and are
attributable to the period prior the Effective Time; (vii) the amount of any
Suspense Funds for which Buyer is to become responsible; and (viii) any other
amount provided elsewhere in this Agreement or agreed upon by Buyer and
Sellers.

(c) The Base Purchase Price will be adjusted upward or downward, as
applicable, by (i) the net mcf and barrel of oil amount of the aggregate
Imbalances attributable to the Net Revenue Interest in the Wells as of the
Effective Time multiplied by the $2.00 per mcf of 

gas and the $40.00 per barrel of oil for such Well (upward for underage and
downward for overage); and (ii) the mmbtu amount of any pipeline Imbalances or
unsatisfied throughput obligations attributable to Sellers or the Oil and Gas
Assets for Sellers' ownership prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
actual settlement price per mmbtu (upward for over deliveries and downward for
under deliveries).

8.13 Initial Adjustment at Closing.

At least five days before the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide to Buyer a
statement showing its computations, calculated in good faith, of the amount of
the adjustments provided for in Section 3.1 above. Buyer and Sellers shall
attempt to agree upon such adjustments prior to Closing, provided that if
agreement is not reached, Sellers' computation shall be used at Closing,
subject to further adjustment under Section 8.14 below. If the amount of
adjustments so determined which would result in a credit to Buyer exceed the
amount of adjustments so determined which would result in a credit to Sellers,
Buyer shall receive a Base Purchase Price reduction at Closing for the amount
of such excess, and if the converse is true, then the amount to be paid by
Buyer to Sellers at Closing shall be increased by the amount of such excess.

8.14 Adjustment Post Closing.

On or before 90 days after Closing, Buyer and Sellers, shall review any
information which may then be available pertaining to the adjustments provided
for in Section 3.1, shall determine if any additional adjustments should be
made beyond those made at Closing (whether the same be made to account for
expenses or revenues not considered in making the adjustments made at Closing,
or to correct errors made in the adjustments made at Closing), and shall make
any such adjustments by appropriate payments from Sellers to Buyer or from
Buyer to Sellers. If the Parties fail to agree on final adjustments within
such 90 day period, either Party may, within thirty days after the end of such
period, submit the disputed items to PricewaterhouseCoopers or another
nationally-recognized, United States-based independent public accounting firm
on which the Parties mutually agree in writing (the "Accounting Referee");
provided, however, that the Accounting Referee shall not have performed any
material work for any Party or their respective Affiliates within three years
of the date hereof. If PricewaterhouseCoopers is unable or unwilling to serve
as the Accounting Referee and the Parties are unable to agree upon the
designation of a Person or entity as substitute Accounting Referee, then
Sellers or Buyer, or any of them, may in writing request the Bankruptcy Court
to appoint a substitute Accounting Referee; provided that such Person or
entity so appointed shall be a national or regional accounting firm with no
prior material relationships with Sellers or Buyer or their respective
Affiliates and shall have experience in auditing companies engaged in oil and
gas exploration and development activities. Any unresolved matters described
in this Section 8.14 that are not submitted to the Accounting Referee within
such thirty day period shall be deemed waived by the Parties, which waiver
shall be final and binding on the Parties and the subject matter thereof shall
not be subject to further review or audit. The Parties shall direct the
Accounting Referee to resolve the disputes within thirty days after submission
of the matters in dispute. The Accounting Referee shall act as an expert for
the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed matters submitted by
either Party and may not award damages or penalties to either Party with
respect to any matter. Sellers and Buyer shall share equally the Accounting
Referee\'s costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys' fees). The final
settlement statement, whether as agreed between the Parties or as determined
by a decision of the Accounting Referee 

(the "Final Settlement Statement"), shall be binding on, and non-appealable
by, the Parties and not subject to further review or audit. Payment by Buyer
or Sellers, as applicable, for any outstanding amounts on the Final Settlement
Statement shall be made within five Business Days after the date on which all
disputes in respect of the Final Settlement Statement are finally resolved
(whether by agreement of the Parties or pursuant to the Accounting Referee\'s
decision). During the period between Closing and the point in time when such
post-closing adjustment has been agreed, resolved or waived pursuant to this
Section 8.14, each Party shall, on a monthly basis, pay over to the other
Party any revenue received by it (net of related expenses) with respect to the
Oil and Gas Assets which is owed to the other Party as set forth in Section
8.12 above and such payments shall be considered in making such post-closing
adjustment. Should any additional adjustments be required after such
adjustments thereunder are concluded, such adjustments shall be made by
appropriate payments from Buyer to Sellers or from Sellers to Buyer, provided,
however, in no event shall any adjustments be made beyond six months after the
Closing Date. The Parties agree that the amount of one percent (1%) of the
Base Purchase Price shall be set aside from the sale proceeds received by
Sellers at Closing and placed in escrow with an escrow agent proposed by Buyer
and reasonably satisfactory to Sellers pursuant to the terms of a mutually
agreeable escrow agreement for a period of six months for the purpose of
satisfying any obligation of Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.14.

pursuant to this Article 11, all rights and obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement shall terminate without any Liability of any Party to any other
Party; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from
liability for breach of this Agreement prior to such termination (subject to
the limitations of Section 3.2, Section 11.2(c) and Section 11.2(d)). The
provisions of this Section 11.2 (and, to the extent 

applicable to the interpretation or enforcement of such provisions, Article 1
and Article 13), shall expressly survive the termination of this Agreement.

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.1(c)(i), Buyer shall cause the In-the-Money Hedge Book to be novated (or
otherwise assigned or transferred) to Sellers on terms and conditions
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Sellers within five (5) Business Days
(the "Novation Period") (which such Novation Period may be extended upon
mutual agreement of Buyer and Sellers); provided, however, that if the
applicable counterparty to the In-the-Money Hedge Book refuses to approve,
consent to or otherwise effectuate such novation (or assignment or transfer,
as applicable) within the Novation Period (including any extension thereof),
then Buyer shall be required to unwind or otherwise terminate such In-the-
Money Hedge Book within three (3) Business Days after the end of the Novation
Period and cause the transfer directly to Sellers or their respective
designees of the net cash proceeds to be paid to Buyer from such In-the-Money
Hedge Book at the time of such unwinding or termination. Buyer shall promptly
provide notice to Sellers following Buyer's entry into a Hedge Contract (or
series of related Hedge Contracts) in connection with, or related to, the Oil

provide to Sellers a summary of the material economic terms of such Hedge
Contracts if requested by Sellers. For purposes of this Agreement, "In-the-
Money Hedge Book" shall mean all of the Hedge Contracts placed or entered into
by Buyer or its Affiliates on or after the date of this Agreement in
connection with, or related to, the Oil and Gas Assets or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that if unwound, terminated, cancelled or
otherwise, would result in any net cash proceeds being paid as a result
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the In-the-Money Hedge Book refers to the
net positive value of such Hedge Contracts, taking into account any Hedge
Contracts for which losses are incurred.

(c) If, in an exercise of the Sellers' fiduciary duties in consultation with
their advisors, Sellers terminate this Agreement for the express purpose of
entering, and do enter, into an Alternate Transaction, or enter into an
Alternate Transaction without first seeking to terminate or terminating this
Agreement, it is understood and agreed that such actions shall constitute a
breach of this Agreement by Sellers permitting Buyer to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(i) hereof and upon the closing of such
Alternate Transaction, Buyer shall be entitled to its proven actual damages
(subject to the limitation set forth in Section 13.5), as determined by the
Bankruptcy Court, arising as a result of the Sellers' entry into and
consummation of such Alternate Transaction, provided that (i) such damages
shall not exceed $39,500,000, and (ii) Buyer's sole sources of recovery for
such damages shall be (A) the Sellers' Escrow Amount and (B) a Superpriority
Administrative Expense Claim of no more than $24,500,000. If and to the extent
applicable, the Parties shall jointly instruct, pursuant to the Sellers'
Escrow Agreement, the escrow agent to release funds to Buyer from the Sellers'
Escrow Amount to satisfy such proven damages. In the event that the Sellers'
Escrow Amount is not used in its entirety to satisfy Buyer's proven actual
damages, as finally determined by the Bankruptcy Court (or in any event at the
expiration of the six month period commencing on the date of this Agreement,
Buyer does not have pending any claims for damages under this Section 11.2(c)
("Section 11.2(c) Pending Claims"), then any remaining amount of the Sellers'
Escrow Amount which has not been applied to satisfy Buyer's proven actual
damages (or any amount in excess of Buyer's claimed damages under the Section
11.2(c) Pending Claims) shall be released to Sellers, and the Parties shall
deliver joint written instructions to the escrow agent, pursuant to the
Sellers' Escrow Agreement, to that effect. Upon the resolution of any Section
11.2 

(c) Pending Claim, the Parties shall jointly instruct the escrow agent,
pursuant to the Sellers' Escrow Agreement, to release from the Sellers' Escrow
Amount (to the extent available) any proved actual damages arising from such
Section 11.2(c) Pending Claim (subject to the limitation set forth in Section
13.5), as determined by the Bankruptcy Court, to Sellers and any excess amount
reserved on account of such Section 11.2(c) Pending Claim shall be released to
Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall be Buyer's sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to actions by Sellers as described in this
Section 11.2(c), notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in
Article 11 or elsewhere in this Agreement.

(d) If (i) the Closing does not occur due to a breach of this Agreement by
Sellers (other than a breach involving Sellers' entry into and consummation of
an Alternate Transaction as contemplated in Section 11.2(c)) resulting in
termination by Buyer pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(i), and (ii) as a result of
the foregoing, Buyer suffers proven actual damages (subject to the limitation
set forth in Section 13.5) as determined by the Bankruptcy Court, then the
Parties shall jointly instruct, pursuant to the Sellers' Escrow Agreement, the
escrow agent to release funds to Buyer from the Sellers' Escrow Amount to
satisfy such proven damages. In the event the aggregate amount of such proven
actual damages, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court, is less than the
Sellers' Escrow Amount (or in any event at the expiration of the six month
period commencing on the date of this Agreement, Buyer does not have pending
any claims for damages under this Section 11.2(d) ("Section 11.2(d) Pending
Claims"), then any remaining amount of the Sellers' Escrow Amount which has
not been applied to satisfy Buyer's proven actual damages (or any amount in
excess of Buyer's claimed damages under the Section 11.2(d) Pending Claims)
shall be released to Sellers, and the Parties shall deliver joint written
instructions to the escrow agent, pursuant to the Sellers' Escrow Agreement,
to that effect. Upon the resolution of any Section 11.2(d) Pending Claim, the
Parties shall jointly instruct the escrow agent, pursuant to the Sellers'
Escrow Agreement, to release from the Sellers' Escrow Amount (to the extent
available) any proved actual damages arising from such Section 11.2(d) Pending
Claim (subject to the limitation set forth in Section 13.5), as determined by
the Bankruptcy Court, to Sellers and any excess amount reserved on account of
such Section 11.2(d) Pending Claim shall be released to Sellers. Buyer's right
to receive funds from the Sellers' Escrow Amount in accordance with this
Section 11.2(d) shall be Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
breach by Sellers described in Section 11.2(d)(i) above, notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained in Article 11 or elsewhere in this
Agreement.

(e) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 11.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that
without these agreements such Party would not have entered into this
Agreement.

or privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege shall
preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or

be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given, and (b)

right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without

PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, ASSOCIATED WITH, OR RELATING TO THIS

13.6 Entire Agreement; Amendment.

This Agreement (including the Schedules and the Exhibits) and the other
Transaction Documents supersede all prior agreements between Buyer, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, with respect to its subject matter and
constitute a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreements
between Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, with respect
to their subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a written
agreement executed by all of the Parties.

13.7 Assignment.

This Agreement, and the rights, interests and obligations hereunder, shall not
be assigned by any Party by operation of law or otherwise without the express
written consent of the other Parties (which consent may be granted or withheld
in the sole discretion of such other Party); provided, however, that Buyer
shall be permitted, upon prior notice to Sellers, to assign all or part of its
rights or obligations hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates, but no such
assignment shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement.

13.8 Severability.

The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity
or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision
and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability.

13.9 Expenses.

Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, the Parties shall bear their own respective expenses (including
all compensation and expenses of counsel, financial advisors, consultants,
actuaries and independent accountants) incurred in connection with this

(b) Without limitation of any Party's right to appeal any Order of the
Bankruptcy Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction

breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
any and all claims relating to the foregoing shall be filed and maintained
only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the Parties hereby consent and submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Bankruptcy Court and irrevocably waive
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such Action or
Proceeding; provided, however, that, if the Bankruptcy Case is closed, all
Actions and Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be
heard and determined in a Texas state court or a federal court sitting in Fort
Worth, Texas, and the Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such Action or Proceeding and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any such Action or Proceeding. The Parties consent to service of process by
mail (in accordance with Section 13.4) or any other manner permitted by law.

(c) THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY

constitute one and the same instrument. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 13.4, delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature

of this Agreement or such amendment, as applicable.

13.13 Parties in Interest; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns, and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any legal or equitable benefit, claim, cause of action, remedy or right
of any kind.

13.14 Non-Recourse.

No past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner or equity holder of Buyer or any Seller shall have any Liability for
any obligations or liabilities of such Party under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

13.15 Disclosure Schedules; Materiality.

The inclusion of any matter in any Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be
an inclusion for all purposes of this Agreement, in all other Disclosure
Schedules to the extent that 

such disclosure is sufficient to identify the matter to which such disclosure
is responsive and reasonably apparent on its face, but inclusion therein shall
not be deemed to constitute an admission, or otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material or creates a measure for materiality for purposes of this
Agreement. The disclosure of any particular fact or item in any Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed an admission as to whether the fact or item is
"material" or would constitute a "Material Adverse Effect."
