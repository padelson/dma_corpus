parties hereto agree as follows:

 

SECTION 1

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, the Company and Sub shall consummate a merger (the "Merger"), in
accordance with the DGCL, pursuant to which (i) Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Sub shall thereupon
cease, (ii) the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall
continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and (iii) the
corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.
The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. (b) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated in its entirety as
set forth on Exhibit A hereto and shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
Hospira, Inc.

(c) The By-Laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
but as amended as set forth on Exhibit B hereto, shall be the By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. Parent, Sub and the Company shall cause a certificate of
merger with respect to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be filed
on the Closing Date or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree,
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective on the date and time at which the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or such other date and time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time on which the
Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the "Effective Time."

1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at
9:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the parties hereto,
which shall be no later than the second (2nd) business day after satisfaction

susceptible to satisfaction prior to the Closing (the "Closing Date"), at the
offices of Ropes and Gray LLP, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York
10036, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.

1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from

in accordance with the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation
and By-Laws.

1.5 _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be
advised, that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the
Company or Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
each such corporation or otherwise,

 



\- 2 -  all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such

SECTION 2

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.1  _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Sub or the
holders of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the "Company Common Stock") or any shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Sub ("Sub Common Stock"):

(a) _Sub Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of Sub Common Stock
shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, in each case, if any, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company
Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $90.00 (the "Per Share
Price"), payable to the holder thereof in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or book-entry share formerly representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon surrender
in accordance with Section 2.2.

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
United States bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to
act as agent for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection
with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and to receive the funds to which holders
of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(c). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause one of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries to deposit, with
the Paying Agent cash in an amount necessary to pay for the shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund"). If for any reason the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts
to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under
Section 2.1(c), Parent shall promptly deposit or cause a direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of

 



\- 3 -  Parent to promptly deposit additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient
to make all payments of Merger Consideration, and Parent (and, following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall in any event be liable for
payment thereof. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund
as directed by Parent; provided that (i) no such investment shall relieve
Parent from making the payments required by this Section 2; and (ii) no such
investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be
made pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be the sole property of Parent and paid to Parent upon
request.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Within three (3) business days of the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate
(a "Certificate") or book-entry share (a "Book-Entry Share"), which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration: (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify, in the case of Certificates, that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify);
and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the
Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably acceptable to the
Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with, if applicable, such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and properly completed, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, and shall not evidence any interest in, or
any right to exercise the rights of a stockholder or other equity holder of,
the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company Common
Stock_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares evidencing ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein or as otherwise provided
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2\.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following one
(1) year after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed (or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Paying Agents routine administrative procedures) to holders of Certificates

 



\- 4 -  or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to and in compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If Certificates and Book-Entry Shares are not surrendered prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority, unclaimed Merger Consideration payable with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto
in writing and who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect
thereto (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right
to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its statutory right to appraisal.
From and after the Effective Time, a stockholder who has properly exercised
such appraisal rights shall not have any rights of a stockholder of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock, except those provided under Section 262 of the DGCL. A holder of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such shares of Company Common Stock held by him, her or it in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal, in
which case such shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.2.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands for appraisal. Except with the prior written consent of
Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
appraisal.

 



\- 5 - 2.4 _Company Compensatory Awards_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors (or the
appropriate committee of the Company Board of Directors) shall adopt such
resolutions and shall take such other actions as are required to approve and
authorize the actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Section 2.4.

 

(b) Each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (a "Company Option"
and collectively, "Company Options") granted under the Companys 2004 Long-
Term Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Company Equity Plan"), that is

Closing Date shall become vested as of such date. Each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time and, in consideration of such cancellation,
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive promptly, but in no event
later than fifteen (15) days after the Effective Time, a cash payment in
respect of such cancellation from the Surviving Corporation in an amount equal
to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the
exercise price of each such Company Option and (y) the number of unexercised
shares of Company Common Stock then subject thereto (such payment, if any, to
be net of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.5). Each
Company Option for which, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share Price does
not exceed the exercise price of such Company Option shall be cancelled
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.

 

(c) Each restricted stock unit granted under the Company Equity Plan (a
"Company Restricted Stock Unit" and collectively, "Company Restricted Stock
Units") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time and, in consideration of such cancellation,
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive promptly, but in no event
later than fifteen (15) days after the Effective Time, a cash payment in
respect of such cancellation from the Surviving Corporation in an amount equal
to the product of (x) the Per Share Price and (y) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock then subject thereto (such payment to be net of
applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.5).

 

(d) Each outstanding performance restricted stock unit or performance share
award granted under the Company Equity Plan (a "Company Performance Share
Award" and collectively, "Company Performance Share Awards") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of
the Effective Time and, in consideration of such cancellation, the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive promptly, but in no event later than
fifteen (15) days after the Effective Time, a cash payment in respect of such
cancellation from the Surviving Corporation in an amount equal to the product
of (x) the Per Share Price and (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock then subject thereto, assuming target performance has been met with
respect to such Company Performance Share Award (such payment to be net of
applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to Section 2.5).

(e) Each share of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Equity Plan
that is subject to vesting or performance conditions (a "Company Restricted
Share" and collectively, "Company Restricted Shares") that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested as of the
Effective Time and shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock for
purposes of Section 2.1(c) of this Agreement.

 



\- 6 - (f) As of the Effective Time, the Company Equity Plan shall terminate and all
rights under any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company shall be cancelled (without prejudice to any
amounts to which holders thereunder become entitled following the Effective
Time pursuant to this Section 2.4).

(g) With respect to the Companys Basic Stock Purchase Plan and Supplementary
Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the "ESPPs"), the Company shall as soon as
practicable after the date hereof take all actions necessary to provide that
(i) no new participants shall be permitted to participate in the ESPPs, (ii)
participants in the ESPPs may not increase their rate of payroll deductions,
(iii) each participants outstanding right to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock under the ESPPs shall be suspended immediately following the end
of the purchase or offering period in effect on the date of this Agreement or,
if earlier, the date that is two business days prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ that each participants accumulated payroll deductions under the
ESPPs as of the date of the end of such purchase or offering period shall be
used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock on the business day
immediately prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the
ESPPs, and the shares of Company Common Stock purchased thereunder shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c); and, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the purchase of shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with this Section 2.4(g), the funds, if any, that remain
in a participants accounts after such purchase shall be returned to the
participant. The Company shall cause the ESPPs to terminate at the Effective
Time, and no further purchase rights shall be granted or exercised under the
ESPPs thereafter.

 

(h) With respect to the Companys Equity-Based Award / Recognition Plan (the
"Recognition Plan"), the Company shall as soon as practicable after the date
hereof take all actions necessary to provide that (i) no new awards shall be
granted under the Recognition Plan and (ii) any awards outstanding under the
Recognition Plan on the date hereof that have not been settled by their terms
as of the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive an amount per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such award equal to the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.1(c), which such amount shall be paid to the award holder in
accordance with and subject to the terms of the Recognition Plan. The Company
shall cause the Recognition Plan to terminate at the Effective Time, and no
further awards shall be granted under the Recognition Plan thereafter.

necessary to cash out and cancel all Company Options, Company Performance
Share Awards, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Restricted Shares or

cash payment made pursuant to this Section 2.4, the Company, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation retain the right to defer payment of any such amounts to
the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 



\- 7 - 2.5 _Withholding_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Units, Company Performance Share
Awards or Company Restricted Shares such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of applicable
Tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the relevant Governmental
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise
have been paid.

2.6 _Transfer Taxes_. If payment of the Merger Consideration payable to a
holder of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger is to be made
to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid all
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as
applicable, surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable Laws, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code.

other payment, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit
or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
director, employee, consultant or independent contractor, or (iii) accelerate

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not give rise to a
material liability to or obligation of the Company or its subsidiaries to

\- 33 -  this Agreement, there are no outstanding judgments, writs, injunctions,
decrees or orders of any Governmental Authority against or binding on Parent
or any of its subsidiaries, except as would not, individually or in the

5.2 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company has ceased, and has instructed its officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other advisors,
agents or representatives that have been involved in the negotiation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any proposal received since January 1,
2014 that would have constituted an Acquisition Proposal if received following
the date hereof (collectively, "Representatives") to cease, and caused to be
terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and communications with any
persons or entities with respect to any offer or proposal or potential offer
or proposal relating to any transaction or proposed transaction or series of
related transactions, other than the transactions contemplated hereby,
involving any Acquisition Proposal. Except as provided in Section 5.2(b) or
5.2(c) below, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, the Company shall not and
shall not authorize its Representatives (and shall use its reasonable best
efforts not to permit its Representatives), to directly or indirectly through
another person, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way
of furnishing any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries), or knowingly induce or knowingly take any other action which
is intended to lead to the making, submission or announcement of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in negotiations or discussions with, or
provide any information or data to, any person (other than Parent or any of
its affiliates or representatives) relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding or other Contract contemplating an Acquisition
Proposal or (v) resolve to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, within
24 hours of the date hereof, terminate access by any third party to any data
room (virtual or actual) containing any of the Companys confidential
information. Within two (2) business days from the date hereof, the Company
shall request the return or destruction of all confidential, non-public
information provided to third parties prior to the date hereof that have,

 



\- 39 -  since January 1, 2014, entered into confidentiality agreements relating to a
possible Acquisition Proposal with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.2(a) or in
Section 6.4 or any other provision hereof shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (A) taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders its position with respect to any tender or exchange offer by a
third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of
its position thereunder or (B) making any disclosure to its stockholders if
the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith that the failure to
make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the Company Board of
Directors fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law; provided, however, that (1) in no event shall this Section 5.2(a) affect
the obligations specified in Section 5.2(b) or 5.2(c) and (2) any such
disclosure (other than issuance by the Company of a "stop, look and listen"
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Company Board of Directors with respect to
this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board of Directors in connection with
such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect to
this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the
Company Board of Directors, without disclosing any Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date on which the Company has
received Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives a written
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company from a third party and the
receipt of such Acquisition Proposal was not initiated, solicited, knowingly
encouraged or knowingly induced in violation of Section 5.2(a), then the
Company may furnish information concerning its business, properties or assets
to any person pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms relating to
the confidential information of the Company no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and may negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations
with such person concerning an Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute a
Superior Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in any case within 24 hours
and prior to furnishing information concerning the Company to such third
party) (i) provide Parent notice (A) of the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal and (B) of any inquiries, proposals or offers received by, or any
discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Company or its Representatives concerning an Acquisition Proposal or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and disclose
the identity of the other party and the material terms of such inquiry, offer,
proposal or request and, in the case of written materials, provide copies of
such materials and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written information
concerning the Company provided by the Company to such party to the extent not
previously provided or made available to Parent. The Company will keep Parent
reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis (and, in any case within 24
hours of any material development) of the status and details (including
material amendments and material proposed amendments) of any such Superior
Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request. The Company shall
promptly (and in any case within 24 hours), following a determination by the
Company Board of Directors that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, notify Parent of such determination.

 



\- 40 - (c) Except as permitted by this Section 5.2(c), neither the Company Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or
propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub,
the approval or recommendation by the Company Board of Directors or any such
committee of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend or
publicly propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iii)
enter into any agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement in compliance
with Section 5.2(b)) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this sentence being referred to as a "Adverse Recommendation
Change"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date on which the
Company has received Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of
Directors may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if (x) the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that was not initiated, solicited, knowingly
encouraged or knowingly induced, or the result of any action knowingly taken
which was intended to lead to the making, submission or announcement of such
Acquisition Proposal in violation of Section 5.2(a) that the Company Board of
Directors concludes constitutes a Superior Proposal or (y) an Intervening
Event occurs and as a result thereof the Company Board of Directors determines
in good faith that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law; provided that (1) prior to effecting such
an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to a Superior Proposal, (A) the
Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change; (B) the Company has provided Parent a copy of all
proposed definitive agreements (including all financing documents if
applicable) with respect to such Superior Proposal; (C) if requested to do so
by Parent, for a period of four (4) business days following delivery of such
notice, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith, and
shall have made its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good
faith, with Parents representatives any bona fide proposed modifications to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (D) no earlier than the end of
such four (4) business day period, the Company Board of Directors shall have
concluded, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or
modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such four (4)
business day period, that such Superior Proposal still constitutes a Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any change to the financial or
other material terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a notice
hereunder shall require a new notice to the Parent as provided above, but with
respect to any such subsequent notices references herein to a "four (4)
business-day period" shall be deemed references to a "three (3) business day
period") and (2) prior to effecting such an Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to an Intervening Event, (x) the Company has notified Parent in
writing that it intends to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, describing
in reasonable detail the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change; (y)
if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of four (4) business days
following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have discussed and
negotiated in good faith, and shall have made its Representatives available to
discuss and negotiate in good faith, with Parents representatives any bona
fide proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
(z) no earlier than the end of such four (4) business day period, the Company
Board of Directors shall have determined in good faith, after considering
the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement
proposed by Parent during such four (4) business day period, that the failure
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would still be inconsistent with
the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law. Any such Adverse Recommendation Change
shall not change the approval of the

 



\- 41 -  Company Board of Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover
statute or other state Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger.

 

5.3 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Section 5.3, (i) the term "Covered Employees" shall
mean employees (other than Covered Union Employees) who are employed by the
Company or its subsidiaries at the Effective Time and whose employment will
continue with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or one of their respective
subsidiaries following the Effective Time; and (ii) the term "Continuation
Period" shall mean the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on
the second anniversary of the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, an
employee who is a Covered Union Employee as of the Effective Time who ceases
to be a Covered Union Employee during the Continuation Period but remains an
employee of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or one of their respective
subsidiaries shall be a Covered Employee for purposes of this Section 5.3.

 

(b) _Base Compensation; Annual Target Bonus Opportunity; Post-Effective Time
Bonus Payments_. For the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each Covered Employee, an annual
base salary or hourly rate of pay and an annual target cash bonus opportunity
(expressed as a percentage of base salary) that, in each case, is no
less than the base salary or hourly rate of pay or the annual target bonus,
as applicable, that such Covered Employee received from the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each Covered Employee who remains
employed through the last day of the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs, an annual bonus payment for such year that is not less than their pro-
rata annual target bonus for the period commencing on the Effective Time and
ending on the last day of the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs.

(c) _Benefit Plans_. During the Continuation Period, Parent shall maintain or
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain employee benefit plans, programs,
policies, arrangements and agreements including without limitation severance
plans, arrangements and agreements for Covered Employees that are no less
favorable in the aggregate (and individually, with respect to any severance
plan or arrangement) to the Company Plans that were in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than the bonus plans described in Section
5.3(b) above, long-term incentives, change in control, retention, transaction,
stay or similar arrangements); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) with respect
to employees who are subject to Collective Bargaining Agreements and who are
employed by the Company or its subsidiaries at the Effective Time and whose
employment will continue with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or one of
their respective subsidiaries following the Effective Time ("Covered Union
Employees"), employee benefits shall be provided in accordance with the
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements, (ii) Parents obligations under
this Section 5.3 shall be subject to such modifications as are necessary to
comply with applicable Laws of the foreign countries and their political
subdivisions, and applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements, and (iii)
Parent shall have no obligation to offer any Covered Employee or any
Covered Union Employee the opportunity to participate in any of Parents or
its subsidiaries employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements.

 



\- 42 - (d) _Crediting of Payments_. In the event any Covered Employee first becomes
eligible to participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or
arrangement of the Parent or Surviving Corporation ("Parent Employee Benefit

Surviving Corporation to use reasonable best efforts to, (i) waive any pre-
existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Covered Employee
under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, or vision
benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the employee benefit plan Covered Employee participated in
immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan;
and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage under any Parent
Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such amount was paid,
to the same extent such credit was given under the employee benefit plan

Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan.

(e) _Service Crediting_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize, all service of each
Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company and its

including, but not limited to, under any pension or post-retirement benefit
plans; (ii) the level of non-elective employer contributions under any 401(k)
plan of Parent or (iii) eligibility to participate in, or the level of
benefits under, any Parent retiree medical program in which any Covered
Employee participates after the Effective Time. In no event shall anything
contained in this Section 5.3(e) result in any duplication of benefits for the
same period of service.

(f) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company and
its subsidiaries shall, following consultation with Parent, use their
reasonable best efforts to satisfy all notice, consultation and consent
requirements with respect to the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries

Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time,
the Company and its subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company Plan or
other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement in accordance
with its terms, nor shall anything in this Section 5.3 be construed
to require Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including, following the
Effective Time, the Company and its subsidiaries) to retain the employment of
any particular Covered Employee or Covered Union Employee for any fixed period
of time following the Effective Time.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the
Effective Time, the terms and conditions of employment for any Covered Union
Employee, to the extent applicable and in accordance with the terms of the
relevant Collective Bargaining Agreement, shall continue to be governed by
such Collective Bargaining Agreement until its expiration, modification or
termination in accordance with its terms and applicable Laws.

 



\- 43 - (i) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.5, the provisions of this
Section 5.3 are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto, and no current
or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party

Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto. The
Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the

amendment or supplement thereto), the Company shall provide Parent, Sub and
their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document
and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions, or
changes suggested thereto by Parent, Sub and their counsel. Parent shall
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Sub as may be
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement,
including such information that is required by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the
Proxy Statement, and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in
the preparation of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the
SEC. The Company shall establish a record date for the Company Stockholders

6.2 _Meeting of Stockholders of the Company_. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders
Meeting") for the purpose of seeking

 



\- 44 -  the Company Stockholder Approval and, unless the Company Board of Directors
shall have effected a Change of Recommendation, use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit approval of this Agreement. The Company shall schedule the
Company Stockholders Meeting to be held within forty-five (45) days of the
initial mailing of the Proxy Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company may postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting: (i)
with the consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed or (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure required
under applicable Laws and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated to and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company may, and at the instruction
of Parent shall, postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting

meeting to adopt this Agreement to allow reasonable additional time for
solicitation of proxies for purposes of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , that (x) Parent shall require no more than two such
postponements, recesses or adjournment, which together shall last no more than
twenty (20) business days and (y) acting without the consent, or at the
direction, of Parent, the Company may not postpone, recess or adjourn the
meeting more than two times, which together shall last no more than twenty

6.3 _Access to Information_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall be

access to the assets, properties, records, business and operations of the
Company as is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with Parents
investigation of the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and with respect to Parents integration planning and transaction
structuring. Any such investigation and examination shall be conducted at
reasonable times during business hours upon reasonable advance notice and
under reasonable circumstances so as to minimize disruption to or impairment
of the Companys business. No investigation by Parent or the Company
(whether conducted prior to or after the date of this Agreement) shall
diminish or obviate any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Company or Parent contained in this Agreement. In order that
Parent may have a reasonable opportunity to make such investigation, the
Company shall furnish the representatives of Parent during such period with
such information and copies of such documents concerning the affairs of the
Company as such representatives may reasonably request and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its officers, employees, consultants, agents,
accountants and attorneys to reasonably cooperate with such representatives in
connection with such investigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not be required to provide access to or disclose (a) any
information or documents which would (in the reasonable judgment of the
Company) be reasonably likely to (i) constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client or other privilege held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
(ii) violate any applicable Laws or (iii) breach any agreement of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries with any third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required
consents and take such other reasonable action (such as the entry into a joint
defense agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss of attorney-client
privilege) to permit such access or disclosure; or (b) if the Company or any
of its affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its affiliates, on
the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, any information that is
reasonably pertinent thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Parent shall not be entitled to undertake

 



\- 45 -  any environmental sampling or testing in connection with its investigation
of the Companys (or its subsidiaries) properties, business and operations.
The information and documents so provided shall be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.4 _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning the Merger
shall be a joint press release and, thereafter, so long as this Agreement is
in effect, neither Parent, Sub nor the Company will disseminate any press
release or other announcement concerning the Merger or this Agreement or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as may be
required by Law, without the prior consent of each of the other parties
hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without prior consent of the other
parties, each party (a) may communicate information that is not confidential
information of any other party with financial analysts, investors and media
representatives in a manner consistent with its past practice in compliance
with applicable Law and (b) may disseminate the information included in a
press release or other document previously approved for external distribution
by the other parties. Each party agrees to promptly (and in any event within
two (2) business days) make available to the other parties copies of any
written communications made without prior consultation with the other parties.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) no party will be
required to consult with the other party in connection with any such press
release or announcement if the Company Board of Directors has effected any
Adverse Recommendation Change or shall have resolved to do so and (ii)
the requirements of this Section 6.4 shall not apply to any disclosure by the
Company or Parent of any information concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a determination by the
Company in accordance with Section 5.2(b) that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or may constitute, a Superior Proposal or any dispute between the
parties regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent and the Company each agree to (i) file a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and to make filings required by
applicable foreign Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger within thirty
(30) business days of the date of the Agreement (and Parent may "pull and
refile" any such form or filing, if in its reasonable good faith judgment in
consultation with and considering in good faith the views of counsel for the
Company, such step is consistent with expeditiously obtaining a required
approval), and (ii) to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material required pursuant to the HSR Act or any
foreign Antitrust Law. Parent and the Company may agree to postpone any
filings required under Section 6.5(a)(i) based on input from counsel.

(b) Parent and the Company will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and
provide to the other in advance (to the extent legally permissible), any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals
made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in

 



\- 46 -  connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. Without
limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree (A) to give each other
reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Authority
relating to any Antitrust Laws, (B) to give each other an opportunity to
participate in each of such meetings, (C) to the extent practicable, to give
each other reasonable advance notice of all substantive oral communications
with any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws, (D) if any
Governmental Authority initiates a substantive oral communication regarding
any Antitrust Laws, to promptly notify the other party of the substance of
such communication, (E) to provide each other with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon all written communications (including
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals) with a Governmental Authority regarding any Antitrust Laws and (F)
to provide each other with copies of all written communications from any
Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any such disclosures or
provision of copies by one party to the other may be made on an outside
counsel basis if appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
(after consulting with and considering in good faith the views of the Company)
in its sole discretion control all aspects of the Companys efforts to gain
regulatory clearance under any applicable Antitrust Law either before any
Governmental Authority or in any action brought to enjoin the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to any Antitrust Law.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and subject to
the good faith cooperation of the Company and its subsidiaries, Parent
agrees, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and affiliates, to take any
and all actions necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or approvals
required under or in connection with the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade, the creation or strengthening of a
dominant position or the significant impediment of effective competition or
similar effects (collectively "Antitrust Laws") to enable all waiting periods
under applicable Antitrust Laws to expire, and to avoid or eliminate
impediments under applicable Antitrust Laws asserted by any Governmental
Authority, in each case, to cause the Merger to occur prior to the Termination
Date, including but not limited to (1) promptly complying with or modifying
any requests for additional information (including any second request) by any
Governmental Authority, (2) if necessary to obtain clearance by any
Governmental Authority before the Termination Date, offering,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any
and all of the capital stock, assets, rights, products or businesses of Parent
or the Company and their respective subsidiaries and any other restrictions
on the activities of Parent or the Company and their respective subsidiaries
and (3) contesting, defending and appealing any threatened or pending
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or
statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would prevent closing of the
Merger; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to sell, divest or
otherwise dispose of, hold separate, enter into any license or similar
agreement with respect to, restrict the ownership or operation of, or agree to
sell, divest or otherwise dispose of, hold separate, enter into any license or
similar agreement with respect to, or restrict the ownership or operation of
any assets or businesses of either Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective subsidiaries, to the extent that such sale, divestiture,
disposition or agreement would, individually or together with other sales,
divestitures,

 



\- 47 -  dispositions or agreements, involve assets owned by either Parent or the
Company, or any of their respective subsidiaries, that generated revenue in
excess of $450,000,000 during the twelve (12) months ended September 30,
2014, it being understood that such limitation shall not apply to any sale,
divestiture, disposition or agreement that, but for the fact that Parent or
any of its subsidiaries entered into or consummated any acquisitions,
mergers, consolidations or other business combinations by Parent after the
date hereof, would not have been necessary to obtain clearance by a
Governmental Authority or otherwise remove a Restraint prior to the
Termination Date (it being understood that the subject company or business in
any such transaction shall be deemed to be a subsidiary of Parent for purposes
of this Section 6.5(c).

 

(d) Each party will bear its own expenses and costs incurred by such party in
connection with any filings and submissions pursuant to Antitrust Laws.

(e) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority
challenging the Merger, each of Parent, Sub and the Company will cooperate in
all respects with each other and will use its reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger; _provided_ that
Parent, in its sole discretion, may determine to settle such challenge
provided that the terms of such settlement do not prevent or unreasonably
delay consummation of the Merger prior to the Termination Date.

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, each party will use reasonable best efforts
to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of third parties with respect to
any Contracts to which it is a party as may be necessary for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or required by the terms of
any Contract as a result of the execution, performance or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event
will the Company or its subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the
Effective Time, any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party to
obtain any consent, approval or waiver required with respect to any such
Contract, unless Parent agrees to reimburse the Company such amount in the
event this Agreement is terminated.

 

6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose occurrence or
non-occurrence, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition set forth in Section 7.3 not to be satisfied at any time from the
date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, and the Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose
occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, would reasonably be expected
to cause any condition set forth in Section 7.2 not to be satisfied at any
time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date. No such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties, the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement or the remedies available to the party receiving such
notification.

6.7 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall, as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances, after it has notice of any of the
following notify the Parent of actions, suits, claims, governmental
investigations or proceedings instituted or threatened against the Company 

 



\- 48 -  or any of its directors, officers or affiliates, including by any
stockholder of the Company (by any stockholder and relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, "Stockholder Litigation"), before
any court or Governmental Authority, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting the Company, any of its affiliates, or any of its subsidiaries
which, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, or seeking damages or discovery in
connection with such transactions. Subject to entry into a customary
joint defense agreement, Parent shall have the right to participate in the
defense of any such actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings, the
Company shall consult with Parent regarding the defense of any such actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings, and the Company may not settle
or compromise any Stockholder Litigation without the prior written consent of
Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

6.8 _Resignations; Integration Planning_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, at the written request of Parent, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any director and any officer of
the Company and each subsidiary of the Company identified by Parent in such
written request (by name, category or other reasonable manner of
identification) to execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her
resignation as a director or officer (but not as an employee and without
prejudice to such persons rights) of such entity effective as of the
Effective Time. At the written request of Parent, the Company will use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to effect the replacement of
any such directors and officers selected by Parent at the Effective Time.

(b) The Company shall obtain Parents prior written consent (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) before broadly
disseminating to the Companys employees any written communications regarding
compensation, benefits or other treatment they will receive in connection
with or following the Merger, unless any such communications are consistent
with prior directives or documentation provided to the Company by Parent (in
which case, the Company shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide
Parent with prior notice of and the opportunity to review and comment upon any
such communications).

(c) After the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall establish a mechanism, subject to applicable Law, reasonably
acceptable to both parties by which the parties will confer on a regular and
continued basis regarding the general status of the ongoing operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries and integration planning matters and communicate
and consult with specific persons to be identified by each party to the other
with respect to the foregoing. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company
shall reasonably cooperate with Parent to the extent reasonably required in
connection with any Tax matters relating to the Merger including with respect
to its structure and Parents integration planning (including by the
provision of reasonably relevant records or information and the using
reasonable best efforts to make available relevant third party advisors).

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
use reasonable best efforts to do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of NYSE to cause the delisting of the Company 

 



\- 49 -  Common Stock from NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event no more than ten (10) days following the Effective Time (such
period between the Effective Time and the date of which shares of the Company
Common Stock are delisted, the "Delisting Period"), and deregistration of the
Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
such delisting. The Company shall take no action that would cause the Company
Common Stock to be delisted from the NYSE prior to the Effective Time. If the
Surviving Corporation is reasonably likely to be required to file any periodic
reports pursuant to the Exchange Act during the Delisting Period, then the
Company will use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent at least five
(5) business days prior to the Closing a substantially final draft of any such
periodic reports reasonably likely to be required to be filed during the
Delisting Period.

(e) The parties agree that any action taken or not taken with respect to the
matters contemplated by this Section 6.8 will not be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether any condition in Section 7 is satisfied or
whether any right of termination arises under Section 8, and will not in any
event give rise to liabilities or obligations of the Company or its
subsidiaries.

6.9 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) Parent and Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification
(and all rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto) for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger), now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided
in the Company Charter Documents or in any Contract between such Indemnitee
and the Company listed on Section 6.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter (in
each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with respect to (x) all acts
or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior to
the Effective Time or (y) any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of
or pertains to the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions contemplated
hereby, in either case, in each of (x) and (y) to the extent provided in the
Company Charter Documents or in any Contract between such Indemnitee and the
Company listed in Section 6.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter (in each case
as in effect on the date of this Agreement). For a period of six (6) years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and limitation of director, officer and employee liability that are no less
favorable to the Indemnitees than those set forth in the Company Charter
Documents as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Sub shall obtain and fully pay the premium
for a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnitees

 



\- 50 -  than the existing directors and officers insurance policies and the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies ("DandO Insurance")
with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that neither
Sub nor Parent shall be required to pay for such "tail" prepaid policy more
than three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for its DandO Insurance. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect for its full term. If the Surviving
Corporation is unable to, or otherwise does not, obtain such "tail" prepaid
policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue
to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after
the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement or, if such insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO
Insurance in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance; provided, further, that if
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(c) The Indemnitees to whom this Section 6.9 applies shall be express third-
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Section 6.9
shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be
binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnitees. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall ensure that proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed
to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall guaranty, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants and agreements contained in this Section 6.9.

 

6.10 _Company Notes; Credit Facility; Financing Cooperation_. Subject in each
case to Section 6.10(d) and (e):

 

(a) From the date hereof, if Parent requests in writing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to comply with the terms of the Indenture with
respect to, subject to applicable Law, (i) conditioned upon the Closing, the

\- 51 -  the Company Notes from the holders thereof at the "make-whole" price set
forth in the Indenture, including the delivery of any and all appropriate
notices required by the terms of the Indenture, or (ii) the solicitation of
consents from the holders of the Company Notes regarding the amendment,
conditioned upon the Closing and effective as of the Effective Time, of
certain covenants in the Indenture. Prior to taking any of the foregoing
actions, the Company shall consult with and reasonably cooperate with Parent
with respect to the action and the intended manner and form thereof.

 

(b) At the written request of Parent at least ten (10) days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Credit Facility as of the
Effective Time, and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain at the
Effective Time a payoff letter (or confirmation that no amounts are then
outstanding under the Credit Facility) from the agent under the Credit
Facility in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
Parent with respect thereto.

(c) After the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its representatives,
including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors, to, provide Parent
with reasonable cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent
and reasonably necessary and customary in connection with Parent obtaining
debt financing, the proceeds of which would solely be used to finance the
Merger and related fees and expenses (the "Financing"), including, to the
extent reasonably requested and reasonably necessary, customary, and not
otherwise publicly available, using reasonable best efforts to (i) furnish
Parent with (x) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries for the three most recently completed fiscal years,
and related audited statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows
of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the three most recently
completed fiscal years, in each case ended at least 90 days prior to the
Effective Time and (y) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related
statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company and
its consolidated subsidiaries for each fiscal quarter (other than the fourth
quarter) ended after the close of its most recent fiscal year and at least 45
days prior to the Effective Date; provided that in no event shall the Company
be required to provide pro forma financial statements or adjustments
or projections), in the case of this clause (i) to the extent such
information is (1) reasonably available to the Company and its subsidiaries,
(2) prepared in the ordinary course of the Companys business, and (3)
customarily required and necessary for the preparation of the documents
required to close the Financing, (ii) provide reasonable assistance to Parent
in the preparation of one or more confidential information memoranda,

in this Agreement to the contrary, the actions contemplated in this Section
6.10 or under any other provision of this Agreement do not and shall not (A)
require such cooperation to the extent it would require the Company, any of
its subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives to waive
or amend any terms of this Agreement, incur any actual or potential
liabilities (of any kind), pay any fees, reimburse any expenses, or provide
any indemnity, or enter into any definitive agreement, in each case, with
respect to any Financing, any actions with respect to the Company Notes or
Credit Facility or any cooperation provided pursuant to this Section 6.10, in

prior reimbursement by or on behalf of Parent, or take any actions that would
cause the Company or any of its subsidiaries to breach this Agreement or
become unable to satisfy a condition to the Closing, (B) require such
cooperation from the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any of its or their
respective Representatives to the extent it would reasonably be expected to
interfere in any material respect with the ongoing operations of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, (C) cause the Company, any of its subsidiaries,
or any of its or their respective Representatives to incur any actual or
potential liability under any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or

the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective
Representatives to be the issuer of any securities or issue any offering

subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives, or to
deliver or require to be delivered any solvency or similar certificate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.10, the parties
agree that any action taken or not taken with respect to the
matters contemplated by this Section 6.10 will not be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether any condition in Section 7 is satisfied or
whether any right of termination arises under Section 8, and will not in any
event give rise to liabilities or obligations of the Company or its
subsidiaries. All non-public or other confidential information provided by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives to
Parent or any of its affiliates pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the terms set forth in the Confidentiality

them, directly or indirectly relating to, arising out of or resulting from
the arrangement of the Financing, any other cooperation pursuant to this
Section 6.10, and/or the provision of information utilized in connection
therewith to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except to the
extent such Losses arise out of the willful misconduct or intentional fraud of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Parent shall from time to time (and
upon request by the Company) promptly reimburse the Company for any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs (including reasonable out-of-
pocket attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the Companys
or its subsidiaries or Representatives obligations under Section 6.10. This
Section 6.10(e) shall survive the Effective Time or earlier termination of
this Agreement.

take all such steps as may be required and permitted to cause any dispositions
of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such
Company Common Stock) by each director or officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.12  _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company and the Company Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and
take such actions within the Companys control as are permitted and necessary
so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

6.13 _Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to cause Sub to comply with
this Agreement, perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement and

\- 57 - 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1
hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and be of no
further force or effect, and there shall be no liability on the part of
Parent, Sub or the Company (or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, agents or representatives), except for the
Confidentiality Agreement and as set forth in the last sentence of Section
6.3, Section 6.10(e), this Section 8.2 and Section 9, each of which shall
remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability
for fraud or the intentional breach of any of its covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled
to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity, including liability
for damages determined taking into account all relevant factors, including the
loss of the benefit of the transactions contemplated hereby to the party, any
lost stockholder premium, any lost synergies, the time value of money, and
any benefit to breaching party or its stockholders arising from such
intentional breach. For purposes of this Agreement, "intentional breach" of a
covenant or agreement shall mean an action or omission taken or omitted to be
taken that the breaching person intentionally takes (or fails to take) and
knows (or should reasonably have known) would, or would reasonably be expected
to, cause a material breach of such covenant or agreement.

 

(b) If Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e),
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent within two (2) business
days of such termination a termination fee of $500,000,000 (the "Termination
Fee"). If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), it
shall, concurrently with and as a condition to such termination, pay or cause
to be paid the Termination Fee to Parent. If (i) this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii), Section 8.1(b)(iii) or Section 8.1(c) with
respect to the breach of a covenant or agreement, (ii) after the date of this
Agreement and (x) prior to the time of termination in case of such a
termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) or Section 8.1(c) or (y) prior to
the Company Stockholder Meeting in the case of a such a termination pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(iii), an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
announced or otherwise communicated to the Company Board of Directors and not
withdrawn prior to the time of termination or prior to the Company
Stockholder Meeting, as applicable, and (iii) within twelve (12) months after
the date on which this Agreement shall have been so terminated, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated (for purposes of this Section
8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "twenty
percent (20%)" shall be deemed references to "fifty percent (50%)"),
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Termination Fee upon
the earlier of the execution of such definitive agreement or consummation of
such Acquisition Proposal. All amounts due hereunder shall be payable by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to such account as Parent may
designate in writing to the Company. If the Company fails to promptly make any
payment required under this Section 8.2(b) and Parent commences a suit to
collect such payment, the Company shall indemnify Parent for its reasonable
fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred
in connection with such suit and shall pay interest on the amount of the
payment at the prime rate in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
the payment was payable pursuant to this Section 8.2(b). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (ii) if
Parent

 



\- 58 -  receives the Termination Fee in accordance with this Section 8.2(b), such
payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Sub hereunder,
and upon such payment, the Company shall have no further liability (in
contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of, or with respect to, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to Parent, Sub or any of
their respective affiliates.

 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, including
Section 6.10(e), all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated; provided,
however, that if (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(ii), Section 8.1(b)(iii) or Section 8.1(c) with respect to the breach
of a covenant or agreement, and (ii) after the date of this Agreement and (x)
prior to the time of termination in case of such a termination pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(ii) or Section 8.1(c) or (y) prior to the Company Stockholder
Meeting in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii), an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
communicated to the Company Board of Directors and not withdrawn prior to the
time of termination or prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, as
applicable, the Company shall reimburse Parent and Sub within five (5)
business days following Parents written request for $20,000,000 for expenses
incurred or paid by or on behalf of Parent in connection with this Agreement
or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Expenses"); provided further that for purposes of this Section 8.3, (A)
all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "twenty percent
(20%)" shall be deemed references to "fifty percent (50%)", and (B) any such
Expenses paid to the Company shall be credited against the Termination Fee
when the Termination Fee is paid.

8.4  _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and as otherwise provided in the
Agreement, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and
all respects, whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the
Company contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by
action taken by their respective Boards of Directors, but after the approval
of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be
made which by Law requires further approval by such stockholders without
obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Sub, on the other hand, hereto may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other party or parties (as applicable) hereto or (b) waive compliance with any
of the agreements of any other party or parties (as applicable) or any
conditions to its own obligations, in each case only to the extent such
obligations, agreements and conditions are intended for its benefit; provided,
that any such extension or waiver shall be binding upon a party only if
such extension or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by such party.

contain the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the Merger and

among the parties with respect thereto.

 

9.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions arising under or in
connection therewith shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 

9.5 _Binding Effect; No Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties, except that (i) the Sub may assign, in its sole discretion and
without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations hereunder to Parent, and (ii) each of Parent and the Sub may
assign, in their respective sole discretion and without the consent of any
other party, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to
one or more direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent (each,
an "Assignee"), in each case, so long as such assignment would not delay,
impair or prevent consummation of the Merger or otherwise result in a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Any such Assignee shall be a "party" for purposes
of this Agreement and may thereafter assign, in its sole discretion and
without the consent of any other party, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations hereunder to one or more additional Assignees. Subject to the
preceding sentences, but without relieving any party hereto of any obligation
hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
Notwithstanding any such assignment contemplated by this Section 9.5(a),
nothing herein shall relieve Parent or Sub of any obligation under this
Agreement.

(b) Other than the provisions of Section 2 (which, from and after the
Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock,
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Units, Company Performance Share
Awards and Company Restricted Shares as of the Effective Time to the extent
necessary to receive the consideration due such persons thereunder), and
Section 6.9, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any person other than Parent, Sub and the Company and their
respective successors and permitted assigns any right, benefit or remedy of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



\- 61 - 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

9.7 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain
in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. The
parties further agree to attempt to replace such invalid or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable provision.

9.8  _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver_. Each of the Company, Parent and
Sub (and any Assignee) irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be brought and determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and any appellate
court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state
or federal court within the State of Delaware) and each of the Company,
Parent and Sub (and any Assignee) hereby irrevocably submits with regard to
any action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts
and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such
courts. Each of the Company, Parent and Sub (and any Assignee) hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect
to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that
(i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each such party
agrees that each of the other parties shall have the right to bring any
action or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment entered by the aforesaid
courts in any other court or jurisdiction.

9.9  _Enforcement_. The parties recognize and agree that if for any reason
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm
or injury would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to other remedies,
any other party shall be entitled to an injunction (without posting a bond or
other undertaking) restraining any violation or threatened violation of the

III-15 ARTICLE X

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

 _Section 10.1. __Directors and Officers._ The Corporation shall indemnify
its directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by the
Delaware General Corporation Law; provided, however, that the Corporation may
modify the manner of such indemnification by individual contracts with its
directors and officers; and, provided, further, that the Corporation shall
not be required to indemnify any director or officer in connection with any
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such
indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding
was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, (iii) such
indemnification is provided by the Corporation, in its sole discretion,
pursuant to the powers vested in the Corporation under the Delaware General
Corporation Law or (iv) such indemnification is required under a contract not
inconsistent with subsection 10.4.

_Section 10.2. _ _Expenses._ __The Corporation shall advance to any person
who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a
director or officer, of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director or executive officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final
disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefore, all
expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with such
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to
repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is
not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise. __

 



III-16 _Section 10.3. __Enforcement._ __Without the necessity of entering into an
express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and
officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be
effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the
corporation and the director or officer. Any right to indemnification or
advances granted by this Bylaw to a director or officer shall be enforceable
by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of competent
jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is denied, in
whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety
(90) days of request therefore. The claimant in such enforcement action, if
successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting his claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification,
the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action
that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it
permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the
corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or
its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth
in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the
corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or
its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought
by a director or officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director or
officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses,
under this Article X or otherwise shall be on the corporation. __

disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The
Corporation is specifically authorized to indemnify and provide advances to
any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents to the fullest
extent not prohibited by the Delaware General Corporation Law. The terms and
conditions of such indemnification or advances may, in each case, but need not
be, set forth in a contract between the Corporation and the
indemnified party.

_Section 10.5. __Survival of Rights._ The rights conferred on any person by
this Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person.

Delaware General Corporation Law, the Corporation, upon approval by the Board
of Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw. __

 

 _Section 10.7. __Amendments._ __Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw
shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in
effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act
that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the Corporation __

 

 _Section 10.8. __Saving Clause._ If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall

extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not
have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

_Section 10.9. __Certain Definitions._ For the purposes of this Bylaw, the
following definitions shall apply:

was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or
is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position
under the provisions of this Bylaw with respect to the resulting or surviving
corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if
its separate existence had continued.

 



III-19 (d) References to a "director," "executive officer," "officer," "employee,"
or "agent" of the Corporation shall include, without limitation, situations

services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
