Subsidiaries; 

 

 

WHEREAS,  to effect such transaction, Buyer desires to purchase from Seller,
and Seller  desires to sell to Buyer, all of the issued and outstanding

WHEREAS,  simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer is
entering into  an  employment agreement with each of Paul Damiano, Lawrence

NOW,  THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the
representations,  warranties, covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth,
and intending to  be  legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

 

 

ARTICLE  I

 

 

_PURCHASE  AND SALE OF THE SHARES_

 

 

1.1 _Purchase  and Sale of the Shares_.  Upon  the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the closing  provided for in Section 1.3
hereof (the "Closing"), Seller shall sell,  convey, assign, transfer and
deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase, acquire  and accept from Seller,
all of Seller\'s right, title and interest in and to  the  Shares free and
clear of all Liens.

 

 

1.2 _Purchase  Price_.

 

 

(a) Upon  the  terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, in
consideration of  the  aforesaid sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and
delivery of the Shares,  at  the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to $117,000,000  (the "Base Amount"), plus or minus the
Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment  (as adjusted, the "Purchase

(as defined below) as of the  Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital") and (y) the amount  of  Cash as of 11:59 p.m. on the
Closing Date, net of Seller's good faith estimate  of any tax and currency
exchange costs to Seller or the Company attributable  to  repatriating to
the United States any portion of such Cash which is held outside  the United
States (such net amount, the "Estimated Closing Cash"). If the  Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working  Capital,
then the Base Amount shall be increased by such excess. If the  Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working  Capital,
then the Base Amount shall be decreased by such deficiency. In  addition, the
Base Amount shall be increased by the amount of the Estimated  Closing Cash.
"Net Working Capital" means, on a consolidated basis, the  Company\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' (i) current assets minus (ii) current  liabilities, in each
case excluding Cash, Inter-company Accounts, Income Taxes  payable or
receivable and any deferred Income Tax assets or liabilities, and  shall be
determined in accordance with the methodology illustrated in Schedule  1.2(b)
and, to the extent not inconsistent with such methodology, in accordance 
with GAAP and consistent with the methodology and principles used in the 
preparation of the Financial Statements.  The cash  overdraft in accounts
payable will be eliminated from the Estimated Closing  Net  Working Capital
and the Closing Net Working Capital (as defined below). The  cash  overdraft
is included in Target Net Working Capital.

 

 

(ii) As  soon  as practicable, but in no event later than 75  days 
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement 
containing, in reasonable detail, the Net Working Capital as of the Closing 
(the  "Closing Net Working Capital"), together with the workpapers used in
the  preparation thereof.

 

 

(iii) Seller  shall have 30 days within which to review the statement of the
Closing Net  Working Capital after Buyer\'s delivery thereof. If Seller
disputes the Closing  Net Working Capital, Seller shall notify Buyer in
writing of its objection  to  the Closing Net Working Capital within such
30-day period, together with a  description of the basis for such dispute in
reasonable detail. Buyer and Seller  shall, within 30 days following receipt
of such notice (the "Resolution  Period"), attempt to resolve their
differences in good faith and any resolution  by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive.  If,  at the conclusion of
the Resolution Period, any amounts remain in dispute,  then  each of Buyer
and Seller shall submit all items remaining in dispute to  Deloitte and Touche
LLP or such other nationally recognized firm of  independent accountants
mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller (the "Independent  Accounting Firm")
for resolution by delivering to the Independent Accounting  Firm their
position with respect to such items. All fees and expenses relating  to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall  be 
borne equally between Seller and Buyer. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall  determine, based solely on the submissions by Seller and Buyer, and
not by  independent review, only those issues still in dispute. The
Independent  Accounting Firm\'s determination shall be requested to be made
within 30 days  of  submission as provided above and shall be set forth in a
written statement  delivered to Seller and Buyer and shall be final, binding
and conclusive. The  term "Final Net Working Capital", as hereinafter used,
shall mean the definitive  Closing Net Working Capital agreed to by Buyer and
Seller or the definitive  Closing Net Working Capital resulting from the
determinations made by the  Independent Accounting Firm (in addition to those
items theretofore agreed  to by  Seller and Buyer).

(iv) Within  three Business Days after the Final Net Working Capital is
agreed to or any  remaining disputed items are ultimately resolved pursuant
to Section  1.2(b)(iii): (y) if the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Closing  Net Working Capital, Buyer shall pay Seller the amount of
such excess by wire  transfer in immediately available funds to an account
specified by Seller;  and  (z) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital
exceeds the Final Net Working  Capital, Seller shall pay Buyer the amount of
such excess by wire transfer  in  immediately available funds to an account
specified by Buyer.

 

 

(c) (i)  As soon  as practicable, but in no event later than 15 Business
Days following the  Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement
containing, in  reasonable detail, the amount of Cash as of 11:59 p.m. on the
Closing Date,  net  of Buyer\'s good faith estimate of any tax and currency
exchange costs to Buyer  attributable to repatriating to the United States
any portion of such Cash  which  is held outside the United States (such net
amount, the "Closing Cash"), and  the  amount of Indebtedness as of the
Closing (the "Closing Indebtedness"), together  with the workpapers used in
the preparation thereof.

 

 

(ii) Seller\'s  review of the statement of Closing Cash and Closing
Indebtedness and the  resolution of any disputes between Seller and Buyer
with respect to Closing  Cash  and Closing Indebtedness shall be governed by
the same procedure as set forth  in  Section 1.2(b)(iii). The  terms 
"Final Closing Cash" and "Final Closing Indebtedness", as hereinafter used, 
shall mean the definitive Closing Cash and Closing Indebtedness,
respectively,  agreed to by Buyer and Seller or the definitive Closing Cash
and Closing  Indebtedness, respectively, resulting from the determinations
made by the  Independent Accounting Firm (in addition to those items
theretofore agreed  to by  Seller and Buyer).

 

 

(iii) Within  three Business Days after the Final Closing Cash and the Final
Closing  Indebtedness are agreed to or any remaining disputed items are
ultimately  resolved pursuant to Section 1.2(c)(ii): (w) if the Final Closing
Cash exceeds  the Estimated Closing Cash, Buyer shall pay Seller such excess
by wire transfer  in immediately available funds to an account specified by
Seller; (x) if the  Estimated Closing Cash exceeds the Final Closing Cash,
Seller shall pay Buyer  such excess by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to an account  specified by Buyer; (y) if the Final Closing
Indebtedness is a positive amount,  Seller shall pay Buyer such amount by
wire transfer in immediately available  funds to an account specified by
Buyer; and (z) if the Final Closing  Indebtedness is a negative amount, Buyer
shall pay Seller such amount by wire  transfer in immediately available funds
to an account specified by Seller.  If  any portion of the Final Closing
Cash is denominated in a non-U.S. currency,  Buyer may at its election pay
such amount in such currency.

(ii) Buyer\'s  review of the statement of Closing Inter-company Balances and
the resolution  of  any disputes between Seller and Buyer with respect to

company Balances agreed to by Buyer and Seller or  the  definitive Closing
Inter-company Balances resulting from the determinations  made  by the
Independent Accounting Firm (in addition to those items theretofore  agreed

Balances are agreed  to  or any remaining disputed items are ultimately
resolved pursuant to Section  1.2(d)(ii): (y) if there are any Final Closing
Inter-company Balances owing  to  the Company or any Subsidiary by Seller or
any of its subsidiaries (other than  the Company or any Subsidiary), Seller
shall pay Buyer such amounts by wire  transfer in immediately available funds
to an account specified by Buyer; and  (z) if there are any Final Closing
Inter-company Balances owing to Seller or  any  of its subsidiaries (other
than the Company or any Subsidiary) by the Company  or  any Subsidiary,
Buyer shall pay Seller such amounts by wire transfer in  immediately
available funds to an account specified by Seller.

where any such conflicts, violations or  defaults  as to  which requisite
waivers or consents will have been obtained prior to the Closing  and which,
individually or in the aggregate, are immaterial and do not and  would  not
reasonably be expected to materially impair or materially delay Seller\'s 
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

to  declare, make or pay any dividends or distributions, whether current or 
accumulated, or due or payable, on any Shares.

Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed  to do business as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity and is in good  standing, where applicable,
in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,  leased or operated by it
or the nature of the business conducted by it makes  such qualification
necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure  to  be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing, where applicable, would  not
subject the Company and its Subsidiaries to material Liabilities. Seller 
has  heretofore made available to Buyer complete and correct copies of the 
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or other similar organizational 
documents, of the Company and each Subsidiary, as in effect as of the date 
of  this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term "Subsidiary" shall

Company, enforceable against the Company  in  accordance with its terms,
except that such enforcement may be subject to the  Enforceability

(b) Neither  the Shares, nor any Subsidiary Shares, were issued in violation
of, or are  subject to, any preemptive, subscription or similar rights. There

sentence, sets forth a complete list  as  of the date hereof of all: (i)
registered Patents and pending Patent  applications, (ii) registered and

with respect to each registered item and each item subject to  an 
application for registration, the registration or application number and all

retroactive to the date of this Agreement,  including without limitation for
purposes of Section 9.3 and Article XI. Except  for the Licensed Marks and
the Intellectual Property used by Company and its  Subsidiaries pursuant to
the Transition Services Agreement, none of the Seller  nor any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) own,  license,
maintain rights in or otherwise provide any Intellectual Property  used  in
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except the Copyrights

Subsidiaries  uses any Trade Secrets that are material to their business and
that will not  be  available to the Company or its Subsidiaries after the

Agreement, on the same  terms as such Trade Secrets were available to the
Company and its Subsidiaries  prior to the Closing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) (i)  Each  of the Company and its Subsidiaries owns: (y) to the
knowledge of Seller,  Copyright registrations not listed on Section 4.9(a) of
the Company Disclosure  Schedule, and (z) all other Intellectual Property
registrations, in each of  (y)  and (z) that are registered in the name of
the Company or its Subsidiaries  and  are used in the conduct of their
respective businesses as conducted on the  date  hereof in the jurisdictions
in which such Intellectual Property is registered  on  the date hereof, all
of which rights shall survive unchanged by the consummation  of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) to the knowledge of  the 
Seller, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries owns or has the right to
use  all of the Intellectual Property used in the conduct of their
respective  businesses as conducted on the date hereof in the jurisdictions
in which such  Intellectual Property is used by them on the date hereof but
is unregistered,  all of which rights shall survive unchanged by the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) with
respect to Scheduled  Intellectual Property and all other Intellectual
Property owned by the Company  and its Subsidiaries (the "Owned Intellectual
Property"), the Company or a  Subsidiary exclusively owns (beneficially, and
of record where applicable)  all  such Intellectual Property, free and clear
of all Liens, exclusive licenses  and  non-exclusive licenses not granted in
the ordinary course of business except  where the failure to have such
ownership is immaterial; and (iv) to the  knowledge of Seller, all Owned
Intellectual Property is valid, subsisting and  enforceable, and is not
subject to any outstanding order, judgment, decree  or  agreement adversely
affecting the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' use of, or  its  rights to,
such Intellectual Property.

 

 

(c) As  of the  date hereof, there is no material litigation, opposition,
cancellation,  proceeding, objection or claim pending, asserted or, to the
knowledge of Seller,  threatened against the Company or the Subsidiaries
concerning the ownership,  validity, registerability, enforceability,
infringement or use of, or licensed  right to use any Owned Intellectual
Property, and to the knowledge of Seller,  any other Intellectual Property.
To the knowledge of Seller, no valid basis  for  any such litigation,
opposition, cancellation, proceeding, objection or claim  exists. To the
knowledge of Seller, no person is violating any Owned  Intellectual Property.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) The  Company and the Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to
protect the  material Owned Intellectual Property, and to protect the
confidentiality of  all  material Trade Secrets that are owned by the
Company or the Subsidiaries, or  that are used or held by the Company or the
Subsidiaries to the extent used  or  held by them, and, to the knowledge of
Seller, such Trade Secrets have not  been  used, disclosed to or discovered
by any person except pursuant to valid and  appropriate non-disclosure and/or
license agreements which have not been  breached. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable  steps to protect their
material Owned Intellectual Property and, with immaterial  exceptions, any
employees, consultants, contractors and agents that made a  contribution to
any Owned Intellectual Property have executed or are subject  to  agreements
under which such Intellectual Property rights are assigned to and  owned
exclusively by the Company or the Subsidiaries and such employees, 
consultants, contractors and agents are bound to maintain the
confidentiality  of  all confidential information of any material value to
the Company and the  Subsidiaries.

 

 

(e) To  the  knowledge of Seller, no person has gained unauthorized access
to the IT Assets  within twelve months prior to the date hereof. The Company
and its Subsidiaries  have implemented reasonable backup and disaster
recovery technology consistent  with industry practices. The IT Assets owned,
used or held for use by the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries have not
materially malfunctioned within  the  three years prior to the date hereof,
or if they have, such malfunctions have  been resolved to enable the
Company\'s operations to continue. The consummation  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have no adverse effect  on the
Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' access to and use of any material IT 
Assets, except to the extent that services provided under the Transition 
Services Agreement will no longer be available to the Company or its 
Subsidiaries following the termination or expiration of such  agreement.

 

 

(f) Section  4.9(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) all
material agreements  under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
licensed or otherwise  permitted by a third party to use any Intellectual
Property (other than "shrink  wrap" or "click through licenses), (ii) all
material agreements under which  a  third party is licensed or otherwise
permitted to use any Owned Intellectual  Property, and (iii) any other
material agreements to which the Company or any  of  its Subsidiaries is a
party and which involve Intellectual Property (including  without limitation
non-assertion agreements, settlement agreements, trademark  coexistence
agreements and trademark consent agreements) (collectively,  "Intellectual
Property Contracts").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Seller  has provided to Buyer complete copies of all of the Intellectual
Property  Contracts that are in writing. Each Intellectual Property Contract
is in full  force and effect and is valid and binding on the Company or its
Subsidiary,  as  applicable, in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability  Exceptions, and will continue to be so immediately following
the consummation  of  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None
of the Company, any  Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of Seller, any other
person who is a party  thereto is in material breach or violation of, or
default under, any  Intellectual Property Contract and to the knowledge of
Seller, no event has  occurred which would result in a breach of or default
under, require any consent  or other action by any person under, or give rise
to any penalty or right of  termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
right or obligation of the  Company or any Subsidiary or to a loss of any
benefit to which the Company  or  any Subsidiary is entitled under (in each
case, with or without notice or lapse  of time, or both) any Intellectual
Property Contract. No Intellectual Property  Contract is subject to any
outstanding order, judgment, decree or agreement  adversely affecting the
Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' use thereof or its rights  thereto. No claim
has been threatened or asserted in writing that the Company  or  its
Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of the Company, another person has 
breached any Intellectual Property Contract. No party to any Intellectual 
Property Contract has given notice of its intention to cancel, terminate,
change  the scope of rights under, or fail to renew such contract. None of
the Company  or its Subsidiaries, nor to the knowledge of the Seller any
other party to  any  Intellectual Property Contract, has repudiated in
writing any material provision  thereof. Consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will  not place the Company or its
Subsidiaries in breach or default of any material  Intellectual Property
Contract, or trigger any modification, termination or  acceleration
thereunder, or create any license under or Lien on Intellectual  Property
owned or held by the Company.

 

 

4.10 _Litigation_.  As of  the date hereof, there are no material claims,
actions, suits, investigations  or  proceedings pending or, to the knowledge
of Seller, threatened against or  affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or
any of their respective assets,  at  law or in equity, by or before any
Governmental Authority, or by or on behalf  of  any third person.  As of 
the date hereof, to the knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred or 
circumstance exists that would reasonably be likely to serve as a basis for 
the  commencement of any material claims, actions, suits, investigations or 
proceedings that would challenge the validity of this Agreement or the 
transactions contemplated hereby.

reasonable best efforts to obtain all  authorizations or waivers required
under the HSR Act and any applicable foreign  antitrust laws to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, including,  without limitation, making
all filings with the Antitrust Division of the  Department of Justice (the

other  party and discuss the contents of the disclosure before issuing any
such report,  statement or press release.

 

 

6.8 _Access  to Books and Records Following the Closing_.  Following the
Closing, Buyer shall permit Seller and its authorized  representatives,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to  have reasonable
access to, and examine and make copies of, all books and records  of the

representatives reasonable access as  contemplated by Section 6.3 and
requested by Buyer that is necessary, proper  or  advisable in connection
with the financing of the Purchase Price, the pledging  of the Company\'s and
the Subsidiaries\' assets as collateral for such financing,  and the other

(a) cooperating with Buyer\'s lenders in connection with their due diligence 
and other review (including a field examination) of the assets of the
Company  and the Subsidiaries and (b) assisting with Buyer\'s preparation
of  certificates and other documents required in connection with such

this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer  shall file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to  all  sales, use, transfer, gains,
stamp, value added, duties, recording and similar  Taxes incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. Buyer and
Seller shall each be responsible for one half of the taxes  covered under
this Section 7.2 and any expenses incurred in complying with  this Section

Tax Returns or such other documentation.

7.4 _Return  Filings_.

 

 

(a) Seller  shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be
filed, on  a  timely basis (in each case, at its sole cost and expense) all
Income  Tax Returns with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary for taxable
periods  ending on or prior to the Closing Date (the "Prior Period Income Tax
Returns").  Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Income Taxes with
respect to the  Company shown to be due on the Prior Period Income Tax
Returns. In addition,  except to the extent of any reserves for Non-Income
Taxes included on the  Closing Date Balance Sheet, Seller shall pay, or cause

expense) all Tax Returns  with  respect to the Company or any Subsidiary
(other than Tax Returns described  in  Section 7.4(a)), including Tax
Returns, if any, for the Straddle Period (the  "Straddle Period Returns") as
well as all Tax Returns for taxable periods  beginning on or after the
Closing Date. Except as provided in Section 7.4(a)  and  7.4(c), Buyer shall

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Buyer  shall provide Seller with copies of any Straddle Period Returns at
least thirty  (30) Business Days prior to the due date thereof (giving effect
to any  extensions thereto), accompanied by a statement calculating in
reasonable detail  the portion of any Taxes shown due on such return for
which Seller is  responsible pursuant to Section 7.7(b)(1) hereof. Seller
shall have the right  to  review such Straddle Period Returns and the
calculation of its share of any  Taxes shown due thereon prior to the filing
of such Straddle Period Returns.  If  Seller disputes the amount calculated,
Seller and Buyer shall consult and  resolve in good faith any issues arising
as a result of the review of such  Straddle Period Return. If Seller agrees
to the amount, Seller shall pay to  Buyer an amount equal to Seller\'s
portion of the Taxes shown on such Straddle  Period Return not later than
three Business Days before the due date (including  any extensions thereof)
for payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle  Period Return. If the
parties are unable to resolve any dispute within fifteen  Business Days after
Seller\'s receipt of such Straddle Period Return, such  dispute shall be
resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm which shall resolve  any issue in
dispute as promptly as practicable and whose cost shall be borne  by  the
parties in proportion to their proportionate liability for Taxes with 
respect to such Straddle Period Return pursuant to Section 7.7. If the 
Independent Accounting Firm is unable to make a determination with respect 
to  any disputed issue prior to the due date (including any extensions) for
the  filing of the Straddle Period Return in question, (A) Buyer shall file,
or  shall  cause to be filed, such Straddle Period Return without such
determination having  been made and (B) Seller shall pay to Buyer, not later
than five days before  the  due date (including any extensions thereof) for
the payment of Taxes with  respect to such Straddle Period Return, an amount
determined by Seller as the  proper amount chargeable to Seller pursuant to
this Section 7.4. Upon delivery  to Seller and Buyer by the Independent
Accounting Firm of its determination,  appropriate adjustments shall be made
to the amount paid by Seller in accordance  with the immediately preceding
sentence in order to reflect the decision of  the  Independent Accounting
Firm. The determination by the Independent Accounting  Firm shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties.

 

 

(d) Seller  and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective  affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives reasonably  to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns (including amended returns  and claims for refund) pursuant to this
Section 7.4, including maintaining  and  making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes  reported on such Tax Returns and
in resolving all disputes and audits with  respect to all taxable periods
relating to such Tax Returns. Buyer and Seller  recognize that Seller will
need access, from time to time, after the Closing  Date, to certain
accounting and Tax records and information held by the Company  to the extent
such records and information pertain to events occurring prior  to  the
Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees that for a period of the later to 
occur of (i) seven years from the Closing Date or (ii) the expiration of the 
applicable statute of limitations (taking into account any applicable
extensions  or tollings), (A) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company
not to,  dispose of or destroy any of the business records and files of the
Company  relating to Taxes in existence on the Closing Date without first
offering to  turn over possession thereof to Seller by written notice to
Seller at least  thirty days prior to the proposed date of such disposition
or destruction and  (B) Buyer shall, in its reasonable discretion, allow
Seller and its agents  and  representatives (and agents and representatives
of its affiliates) to inspect,  review and make copies of such records as
Seller requests from time to time,  such activities to be conducted during
normal business hours and at Seller\'s  cost and expense.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Except  to  the extent reflected in the Final Net Working Capital, any
refunds and credits  of Taxes of the Company with respect to (A) any taxable
period ending on or  before the Closing Date shall be for the account of
Seller, and if received  or  utilized by Buyer or the Company, shall be paid
to Seller within five Business  Days after Buyer or the Company receives such
refund or utilizes such credit,  net of any out-of-pocket costs to Buyer
incurred in recovering such refund  and  net of any Tax detriment incurred
by Buyer as a result of claiming such refund,  (B) any taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the account  of Buyer, and if
received or utilized by Seller or any of its affiliates shall  be paid by
Seller to Buyer within five Business Days after Seller or any of  its 
affiliates receives such refund or utilizes such credit and (C) except as 
provided in the next sentence, any Straddle Period shall be apportioned
between  Seller and Buyer on the basis of an "interim closing of the books."
In the  case  of a refund or credit attributable to any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic  basis and are attributable to the Straddle Period,
other than Taxes based upon  or related to income, the refund or credit of
such Taxes of the Company for  the  Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed to be
the amount of such refund or credit  for  the Straddle Period multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the  number of days in the Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date and the  denominator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period.

 

 

7.5 _Carrybacks_.  Buyer  shall not be entitled to carry back any Tax
Benefit of the Company arising in  any taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date or to amend any Pre-Closing  Period or Straddle Period Tax
Return without the prior written consent of Seller  (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld).

 

 

7.6 _Tax  Elections_.  Buyer  shall not, and shall cause the Company not
to, make, amend or revoke any Tax  election without the prior written consent
of the Seller (such consent not  to be  unreasonably withheld) if such
action could reasonably be expected to have  a  material adverse effect on
any member of the Seller Group with respect to any  taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date or for the Pre-Closing  Period or any Tax refund
with respect thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Buyer shall not, and
shall cause the Company not to, revoke Seller's election  with respect to B and
J Music Ltd. to close its tax year on the close of  business on the Closing
Date.

 

 

7.7 _Tax  Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except to
the extent treated as  an  asset in the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Buyer shall  indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and
its affiliates, at any time  after  the Closing, from and against any
liability for Taxes of the Company or any  Subsidiary (i) for any taxable
year or period beginning after the Closing Date  and with respect to any
taxable year or period beginning before and ending  after  the Closing Date,
the portion of such taxable year or period beginning after  the  Closing
Date (except for Taxes governed by Section  7.2 or  7.3) and (ii) Taxes paid
by Seller for which Buyer is liable under Section  7.2.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless  Seller and its
affiliates from and against any liability for Taxes of the  Company arising
on the Closing Date (and after the Closing) that are  attributable to
activities of Buyer outside of the ordinary course of  business.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except to
the extent treated as  a  liability in the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Seller shall  pay, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer
and its affiliates from and  against any liability for (i) Taxes for any
taxable year or period ending on  or  before the Closing Date and with
respect to any taxable year or period beginning  before and ending after the
Closing Date, the portion of such taxable year  or  period ending on or
before the Closing Date, including, without limitation,  any  obligation to
contribute to the payment of a tax determined on a consolidated,  combined,
unitary or affiliated basis with respect to a group of corporations  that
includes or included the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) Taxes 
resulting from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ceasing to be a member 
of  the Seller\'s Group or attributable to the election to be made under
Section  338(h)(10) of the Code and any state or foreign law equivalents,
(iii) Taxes  paid by Buyer for which Seller is liable under Section 7.2  and
(iv)  in the event that the Sales Tax Certificate Target is not met as of the
Closing  Date, any Covered Sales Taxes; provided, however, that Seller shall
be liable  to  indemnify Buyer for Non-Income Taxes only after the aggregate
amount of all  Buyer's claims for indemnification for Non-Income Taxes for
which Seller would  otherwise be liable pursuant to this Section 7.7(b)
("Non-Income Tax Claims")  exceeds $100,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only
to the extent that such  Non-Income Tax Claims exceed the Deductible. For
purposes of the foregoing,  (x)  the "Sales Tax Certificate Target" shall be
deemed to be met if, as of the  Closing Date, the Company or a Subsidiary, as
applicable, shall have valid  Sales  Tax Certificates from a sufficient
number of its U.S. customers so that the  Company\'s sales to such customers
shall have been at least 50% of the Company\'s  sales to all of its U.S.
customers ending with the most recent twelve full  months for which sales
information is then available, (y) "Covered Sales Taxes"  means any sales
Taxes with respect to transactions occurring during the period  beginning on
the day after the Closing Date and ending at the end of the  180th  day 
after the Closing Date, but only to the extent that any such sales Tax is 
attributable to a failure of the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, to 
possess a valid Sales Tax Exemption Certificate as of the Closing Date and 
assessed at any time after the Closing Date by the relevant state authority 
responsible for collecting sales Taxes, and (z) "Sales Tax Exemption 
Certificate" means any certificate or other documentation that would entitle
the  holder under applicable law to sell property without collecting sales
Tax from  the purchaser thereof in a transaction in which the holder would
otherwise  be  required to collect sales Tax. Seller agrees that it shall
cause the Company  to  use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the Sales
Tax Certificate Target  prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) In  the  case of any Straddle Period, except as provided in subparagraph
(d) below and  in  Section 7.4, the liability for Taxes of the Company for
the Pre-Closing Period  shall be computed as if such taxable period ended on
and included the Closing  Date.

 

 

(d) In  the  case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are
payable for  the  Straddle Period, other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or Taxes  described in Section 7.3, the liability for such Taxes of
the Company for the  Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the  Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number  of  days in the Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the  denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Buyer  shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by Buyer, the
Company  or  any Subsidiary of notice of any pending or threatened federal,
state, local  or  foreign income or franchise tax audits or assessments
which may materially  affect the Tax liabilities for which Seller would be
required to indemnify  Buyer  pursuant to Section 7.7(b), _provided_  
that  failure to comply with this provision shall not affect Buyer\'s right
to  indemnification hereunder unless and to the extent Seller is materially 
adversely prejudiced as a consequence of such failure. Seller shall have the 
right to represent the Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s interests in any tax
audit  or administrative or court proceeding relating solely to taxable
periods ending  on or before the Closing Date or with respect to any Covered
Sales Taxes, and  to  employ counsel of its choice at its expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Buyer shall be entitled to participate in any
such proceeding and Seller shall  not be entitled to settle, either
administratively or after the commencement  of  litigation, any claim for
Taxes which would adversely affect the liability  for  Taxes of the Buyer,
the Company or any Subsidiary for any period after the  Closing Date to any
extent (including, but not limited to, the imposition of  income tax
deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments,  the 
lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of 
amortization or depreciation deductions, or the reduction of loss or credit 
carryforwards) without the prior written consent of Buyer. Such consent
shall  not be unreasonably withheld, and shall not be necessary to the extent
that  Seller has indemnified the Buyer against the effects of any such 
settlement.

 

 

(f) Seller  shall be entitled to participate at its expense in the defense of
any claim  for  Taxes for a year or period ending after the Closing Date
which may be the  subject of indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section
7.7(b) (other than  any  claim under Section 7.7(b)(iv), which shall be
governed by Section 7.7(e)),and,  with the written consent of Buyer, and at
its sole expense, may assume the  entire defense of such tax claim. None of
the Buyer, the Company or any  Subsidiary may agree to settle any tax claim
for the portion of the year or  period ending on the Closing Date which may
be the subject of indemnification  by  Seller under Section 7.7(b) without
the prior written consent of Seller, which  consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 

 

(g) Each  of  Buyer and Seller shall (and shall cause their affiliates and
agents to)  cooperate with the other in contesting any tax controversy
(without charge),  which cooperation shall include, without limitation, the
retention and the  provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such  controversy, and making employees available to provide
additional information  or  explanation of any material provided hereunder
or to testify at proceedings  relating to such controversy.

 

 

(h) Any  indemnity payment payable by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to Seller
pursuant  to  this Section 7.7 shall be paid within thirty days after the
indemnifying party\'s  written request therefor (or, if later, ten days prior
to the date such Tax  is  required to be paid), _provided_   that  such
request shall be accompanied by a copy of the applicable Tax Return or  a 
final audit determination and, if necessary, a statement reflecting the 
calculation of the amount for which the indemnifying party is liable. Within 
thirty days following the receipt of a request for any indemnity payment 
hereunder, together with a computation by the indemnified party of the
indemnity  amount payable hereunder, the indemnifying party shall either (i)
pay such  amount in immediately available funds in the manner designated by
the  indemnified party to the indemnifying party or (ii) if such amount is
payable  with respect to a Tax Return filed pursuant to Section 7.4(a) or
7.4(b) (other  than Straddle Period Returns), request in writing the
Independent Accounting  Firm to determine whether such computation and amount
are correct. After each  party has had the opportunity to consult with the
Independent Accounting Firm,  upon receipt thereof, the indemnified party
shall deliver to the indemnifying  party a statement from the Independent
Accounting Firm setting forth the  determination by the Independent
Accounting Firm of such computation and the  amount payable hereunder as an
indemnity. The determination by the Independent  Accounting Firm in
conformity with the provisions of this Agreement shall be  final, conclusive
and binding on the parties hereto. Within five Business Days  after delivery
to the indemnifying party of the statement of determination  by  the
Independent Accounting Firm of such amount, the indemnifying party shall 
pay  such amount in immediately available funds to the indemnified party in

(i) Any  tax  allocation or sharing agreement or arrangement, whether or not
written, that  may  have been entered into by Seller or any member of

(all  such elections being referred to collectively as the "Section

each Subsidiary for  which a 338(h)(10) Election has been made), and (ii) a
complete set of IRS  Forms  8883 (and any comparable forms required to be
filed under Applicable Law) and  any additional data or materials required to
be attached thereto pursuant to  the  Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 338 of the Code (the "Allocation  Schedules"). The Allocation
Schedules shall be prepared in accordance with  Section 338(h)(10) of the

set forth on Section 7.8(b) of the Company Disclosure  Schedule.

 

 

(c) Seller  shall have thirty (30) days following receipt by it of the
Allocation Schedules  during which to dispute any item contained in the
Allocation Schedules. If  Seller fails to notify Buyer of any such dispute
within such 30-day period,  the  Allocation Schedules shall be deemed to
have been accepted by Seller. If Seller  timely notifies Buyer of any such
dispute, and Buyer and Seller cannot resolve  any such dispute within twenty
(20) days of receipt by Buyer of such notice,  such dispute shall be resolved
by the Independent Accounting Firm; the  determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm with respect to such dispute  shall be made as promptly as

otherwise, except as required  otherwise by any judgment or any settlement or
closing agreement with any  Governmental Authority. Neither Buyer nor Seller
shall take any action to modify  any of the forms or reports (including any
corrections, amendments or  supplements thereto) that are required for the
making of the Section 338(h)(10)  Elections after their execution or to
modify or revoke any of the Section  338(h)(10) Elections following the

which consent shall not be unreasonably delayed  or  withheld.

 

 

(e) Buyer  shall not make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code (or
comparable  provision of state, local or foreign law) without the prior
consent of Seller,  which consent may be withheld in Seller\'s sole and
absolute discretion. From  and  after the Closing Date and until the end of
Seller\'s short taxable year that  begins after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not take any action which would  result in the dividend or other distribution
by B and J Music Ltd. of any of B and J Music Ltd.\'s earnings and profits to
Buyer, any affiliate of Buyer or of  B and J Music Ltd. or to any other person.

_ADDITIONAL  AGREEMENTS_

 

 

8.1 _Company  Employees; Employee Contracts and Benefits_.

 

 

(a) _Employees_.  Buyer  intends that (i) each person employed by the
Company (including such employees  who are not actively at work on account of
(A) leave of absence or (B) any  disability, meaning any illness or injury,
of less than six months duration  as  of the Closing Date, but excluding
such employees who are totally and  permanently disabled under the terms of
the Kaman Pension Plan (as hereinafter  defined)) as of the Closing Date
(such employees, "Kaman Employees") and (ii)  each person employed by each
Subsidiary (including such employees who are not  actively at work on account
of (A) leave of absence or (B) any disability,  meaning any illness or
injury, of less than six months duration as of the  Closing Date, but
excluding such employees who are totally and permanently  disabled under the
terms of the Kaman Pension Plan) as of the Closing Date  (a  "Subsidiary
Employee") shall continue as an employee of the Company, or each  Subsidiary,
as the case may be, following the Closing Date. Buyer and Seller  agree that
the foregoing sentence shall not require Buyer, the Company, or  any 
Subsidiary to continue the employment of any particular such employee after 
the  Closing Date. Buyer agrees (i) that effective immediately as of the
Closing  Date, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
provided with  medical, dental and other welfare benefits that are
substantially comparable  in  the aggregate to the medical, dental and other
benefits (which benefits in  effect as of the date hereof are set forth on
Schedule 8.1(a)) provided to  employees of Buyer (including, but not limited
to, Buyer\'s applicable severance  pay plans and policies), in each case, as
in effect from time to time, on  substantially the same terms and conditions
as similarly situated employees  of  Buyer and with a waiver of any
preexisting condition or delayed eligibility  or  participation restrictions
(to the extent any such restrictions were satisfied  under a similar Company
Plan), and will provide such Kaman Employees and their  dependents credit for
any deductibles and co-insurance incurred under Seller\'s  medical and dental
benefit plans during the current plan year before the Closing  Date, (ii) to
recognize for all purposes under Buyer\'s severance pay plans  or  policies
the service of Kaman Employees or Subsidiary Employees with Seller,  the 
Company or each Subsidiary before the Closing Date, (iii) that each Kaman 
Employee and Subsidiary Employee whose employment with Buyer and its
Affiliates  is terminated within nine (9) months following the Closing Date
shall be  provided with severance payments and benefits in accordance with
the terms  of  Schedule 8.1(a)(iii) hereto, and (iv) to permit Kaman
Employees to take vacation  during 2007 to the extent of any unused vacation
entitlement under Seller\'s  vacation plans, or reimburse such Kaman
Employees for the loss thereof at the  rate of pay not less than that in
effect at Closing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Assumption  of Agreements_.  Buyer  agrees to honor, and to cause the
Company to honor, in accordance with their  terms, each of the severance
agreements with those individuals identified in  Section 8.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule,  and  shall be solely responsible for any WARN
Act obligations or similar obligations  under applicable state laws that may
be applicable in connection with the  termination of employment on or after
the date hereof of any Kaman Employees  or  Subsidiary Employees.

 

 

(c) _Defined  Contribution Plans_.  (i)  Following the Closing Date, the
Kaman Employees and the Subsidiary Employees  shall be eligible to
immediately participate in Buyer\'s 401(k) plan ("Buyer\'s  401(k) Plan"), as
in effect from time to time, on substantially the same terms  and conditions
as similarly situated employees of Buyer, (ii) Kaman Employees  and
Subsidiary Employees shall be eligible to make direct rollovers of their 
applicable account balances in the Kaman Corporation Thrift and Retirement 
Plan  ("Seller\'s Thrift Plan") into Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan, (iii) Kaman
Employees and  Subsidiary Employees shall be eligible to make direct rollover
of any loan  that  is outstanding under Seller's Thrift Plan as of the
Closing Date to Buyer's  401(k) Plan, provided that, in each case, (A) such
employee has submitted a  completed and signed rollover form to the Buyer's
Benefits Department no later  than 30 days following the Closing Date, and
(B) at the same time as such  employee rolls over his or her outstanding
loan(s), such employee also rolls  over his or her entire account balance
under Seller's Thrift Plan to Buyer's  401(k) Plan, and (iv) Buyer\'s 401(k)
Plan shall recognize for all purposes  all  service of the Kaman Employees
and the Subsidiary Employees that was recognized  under Seller\'s Thrift Plan
as if it were service rendered to Buyer. At the  Closing, in accordance with
the terms of Seller\'s Thrift Plan, the Company  and  each applicable
Subsidiary shall cease being a participating company in Seller\'s  Thrift
Plan and both employer and employee contributions to such plan shall  cease
at the Closing Date for all Kaman Employees and Subsidiary Employees; 
provided, however, that as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, 
the  Company shall make a final matching contribution to Seller's Thrift Plan
for  each participating Kaman Employee and Subsidiary Employee for the
portion of  the  payroll period that occurs prior to the Closing Date. In
addition, each of  Seller and Buyer agrees to take any actions reasonably
necessary (including  any  necessary plan amendment) to effect direct
rollover to Buyer's 401(k) Plan of  any loans outstanding under Seller's
Thrift Plan.

 

 

(d) _Incentive  Bonus Plans_.  Buyer  will establish an incentive bonus
plan for all Kaman Employees for 2008 that  is  substantially comparable in
the aggregate (including target bonus opportunity  and the difficulty of
achieving performance targets) to the annual incentive  bonus plan in place
for such employees with respect to calendar year 2007.  Buyer  agrees that
it shall pay to Kaman Employees and Subsidiary Employees, no later  than
March 15, 2008, annual incentive bonuses with respect to calendar year 
2007  to the extent such amounts are accrued as of the Closing Date, and
otherwise  in  accordance with Section 8.1(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

 

(e) _Severance_.  Buyer  shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify
Seller and its Affiliates from  and  against, any Liabilities incurred by
Seller or any of its Affiliates directly  resulting from the termination of
services of any Kaman Employees as of or  prior  to the Closing Date, which
termination of services is at the written request  of  Buyer. Buyer shall be
responsible for, and shall indemnify Seller and its  Affiliates from and
against, any Liabilities incurred by Seller or any of its  Affiliates
directly resulting from the employment or discharge of any Kaman  Employee or
Subsidiary Employees by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates following  the
Closing Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) _No  Amendment, Third Party Beneficiary Rights or Agreement to Maintain
Plans or  Retain Employees_.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall (i) be treated  as  an amendment of any particular
Company Plan or employee benefit plan of Buyer,  (ii) give any third party
any right to enforce the provisions of this Section  8.1 or (iii) obligate
Buyer or any of their Affiliates to (x) maintain any  particular Company Plan
or employee benefit plan of Buyer or (y) retain the  employment of any
particular employee.

 

 

(g) _Authority  over Certain Insured Claims_   Buyer  agrees that Seller
shall have the sole authority over administering and settling  any claims
constituting Buyer Claims under Section 11.2(v) (it being understood  that
settlement of any such Buyer Claims is subject to the last sentence of 
Section 11.2) and Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with Seller in
connection  therewith.

 

 

8.2 _Non-Solicitation_.  Seller  agrees that, for a period of two years from
and after the Closing Date, it  shall  not, and shall cause its Affiliates
not to, without the prior written consent  of  Buyer, directly or indirectly
through another person, (i) solicit to hire,  (ii)  hire, (iii) enter into a
consulting agreement with or (iv) encourage, entice  or  induce to terminate
an employment relationship with any employee of or any  consultant to the
Company or the Subsidiaries at the Closing Date; provided,  that, for
purposes of this Section 8.2, "consultants" shall be limited to  individuals
or to firms whose consulting services have been limited to the  Music 
Business. The foregoing restrictions shall not preclude (a) general 
solicitations or hiring pursuant to general solicitations in newspapers or 
similar mass media not targeted toward employees or consultants of the
Company  or its Subsidiaries or (b) soliciting any person who has left the
employment  of  the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to Seller soliciting
such person (which  person is not in breach of his or her contract of service
with the Company  or  Subsidiary, as applicable).

 

 

8.3 _No  Shop_.  During  the period from the date hereof through the
earlier to occur of (i) the Closing  Date and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section  10.1,  Seller and the Company will

to the Company\'s  or any Subsidiary\'s properties, books and records to, any
person in connection  with any possible proposal for the acquisition of all
or any substantial portion  of the Shares, other capital stock of the Company
or any Subsidiary, or the  assets or business of the Company or any
Subsidiary (whether through a purchase,  merger, consolidation, share
exchange, recapitalization, business combination  or  other similar
transaction). If  the  Closing shall occur, Seller shall promptly thereafter
notify Buyer of the  receipt of any such proposal or any request for
information relating to the  Company or any of the Subsidiaries by any person
who has informed Seller that  such person is considering making, or has made,
such a proposal. Such notice  shall identify the person making, or
considering making, such proposal and  shall  set forth the material terms
of any such proposal received, and Seller will  inform the Buyer in
reasonable detail of the terms, status and other pertinent  details of any
such proposal or request.

agreement,  substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto, to be entered into
by Buyer,  the  Company and Seller at the Closing (the "Trademark Assignment
Agreement") and  (e)  the trademark license agreement, substantially in the
form of Exhibit E hereto,  to be entered into by Buyer, the Company and
Seller at the Closing (the  "Trademark License Agreement"), all of the
agreements and commitments (whether  written or oral) between the Company or
any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and  Seller or any of its subsidiaries, on
the other hand, and all products and  services provided to the Company or any
Subsidiary by Seller or any of its  subsidiaries will terminate without any
further action or liability on the  part  of the parties thereto.  The 
provision of any services by Seller or any of its subsidiaries to the
Company  or  any Subsidiary from and after the Closing shall be for the
convenience, and  at  the expense, of Buyer only and shall be furnished
without any liability on  the  part of Seller or any of its subsidiaries
with respect thereto, _provided_   that the  provision of any services in
connection with any Ancillary Agreement shall  be  governed by the terms of
such Ancillary Agreement.

 

 

8.5 _Dispute  Resolution_.

 

 

(a) _Negotiations_.  Buyer  and Seller shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any dispute arising out of  or  relating to this Agreement (a
"Dispute") within thirty days after one party  notifies the other of such
Dispute (the "Negotiation Period"). All such  negotiations shall be
confidential, and shall be treated as compromise and  settlement negotiations
for all evidentiary purposes, including but not limited  to for purposes of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and any state rules of  evidence.

 

 

(b) _Other  Remedies_.  Buyer  and Seller shall not, and shall not permit
their respective Affiliates to,  initiate litigation with respect to any
Dispute unless the Dispute has not  been  resolved within the Negotiation
Period; _provided_   that  Buyer or Seller may at any time and without
notice file a complaint or seek  an  injunction or provisional judicial
relief, if in its sole judgment such action  is necessary to avoid
irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo  (including, but not limited
to, for statute of limitations reasons or to  preserve any defense based upon
the passage of time). Despite such action,  Buyer  and Seller will continue
to participate in the procedures specified in this  Section 8.5 for so long
and to the extent so specified.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.6 _Certain  Accounts and Payments_. 

 

 

(a) _Disbursement  Accounts_.  Buyer  acknowledges and agrees that all U.S.
disbursement accounts of Seller that  contain both Cash of the Company and
the Subsidiaries and Cash of Seller\'s  other  subsidiaries will be retained
by Seller.

 

 

(b) _Notices_.  Prior  to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Subsidiaries  to, notify in writing all customers, vendors
and other persons doing business  with the Company and the Subsidiaries who
customarily make payments, to which  the Company or any Subsidiary is
entitled, to an account retained by Seller  pursuant to Section 8.6(a). All
such notices shall contain information relating  to where payments from such
persons should be directed following the Closing,  which shall be provided by
Buyer, and shall otherwise be in form and substance  reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer. Any such notices given prior to the Closing  may state that the new
payment account direction shall only take effect once  a  further written
notice is given by the Company to confirm that the Closing  has  occurred.

 

 

(c) _Payments_.  If at  any time following the Closing Seller or any of its
subsidiaries receives  payment to which the Company or any Subsidiary is
entitled, Seller shall, and  shall cause its subsidiaries to, promptly
forward such payment to  Buyer.

 

 

8.7 _Transition  Assistance_.  Seller  shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist and cooperate with  Buyer  following the
Closing, from time to time upon Buyer\'s reasonable request and  at 
Buyer\'s expense, in its efforts to transition and integrate the business of 
the  Company and the Subsidiaries, including functions such as tax,
employee  benefits, human resources, supply chain and legal (but excluding
information  technology, which shall be subject to the Transition Services
Agreement). The  parties agree that the foregoing undertaking shall not
require Seller to provide  assistance other than during normal working hours
by its then current employees  or to a degree that is disruptive to Seller\'s
conduct of its own  business.

 

 

8.8 _Assumption  of Indemnification Obligations_.  If  Seller enters into
any transaction, or a series of related transactions,  resulting in a sale of
Seller or all or substantially all of the assets of  Seller and its
respective subsidiaries taken as a whole (whether through a  purchase,
merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, business 
combination or other similar transaction), Seller shall cause the acquiring 
entity of such assets or, in the case of a merger, the surviving entity in 
such  transaction to directly assume and be jointly and severally responsible
for  the  obligations of Seller under Article XI, provided that the
foregoing requirement  shall only apply should such sale occur within ten
years after the Closing  Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
any such sale is negotiated with  a  private equity firm or firms, it is
understood that the acquiring entity or  surviving entity that would be
responsible for the obligation described in  the  previous sentence shall
mean the acquisition vehicle or vehicles formed for  purposes of the
acquisition and not the private equity firms or the funds that  would provide
the equity financing for such acquisition.

the conditions of this Article XI, Seller shall  indemnify, defend and hold

from or relating to the matters identified  in  Section 11.2(ii) of the

pursuant to Section 11.2(i) shall be effective only after  the aggregate

indemnification exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Threshold"), in which  case Seller
shall indemnify Buyer from the first dollar; provided further that  in no

representation or  warranty of Buyer contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement; or (ii)  other  than such for which indemnification is provided
in Section 7.7, non-fulfillment  of any agreement or covenant of Buyer
(collectively, "Seller  Claims").

 

 

11.5 _Buyer\'s  Limitation of Liability_.  Any  provision in this Agreement

11.6 _Procedures  for Indemnification_.  If an  indemnified party shall
desire to assert any claim for indemnification provided  for under this
Article XI other than a claim in respect of, arising out of  or  involving a
Third-Party Claim, such indemnified party shall notify the  indemnifying
party in writing in reasonable detail (taking into account the  information
then available to such indemnified party) of such claim promptly  after
becoming aware of the existence of such claim; _provided_   that the 
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided  for hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall
have been  materially and actually prejudiced by such failure. If the
indemnifying party  does not respond to such notice within 30 days after its
receipt, it will have  no further right to contest the validity of such
claim.

 

 

11.7 _Conditions  of Indemnification With Respect to Third-Party Claims_. 
The  obligations and liabilities of Seller and Buyer with respect to Buyer
Claims  and  Seller Claims, respectively, which arise or result from claims

to the following terms  and conditions:

 

 

(a) The  indemnified party will give the indemnifying party prompt notice of
any such  Third-Party Claim, setting forth therein in reasonable detail the
basis for  such  Third-Party Claim, and the indemnifying party shall have
the right to undertake  the defense thereof by counsel chosen by it and
reasonably satisfactory to  the  indemnified party, _provided_ ,  that 
failure to provide such prompt notice shall not affect the indemnifying
party\'s  obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the indemnifying
party is  materially and actually prejudiced by such failure; and _provided_
,  _further_ ,  that  the indemnified party will reasonably cooperate with
the indemnifying party  in  defending such Third Party Claim. If the
indemnifying party undertakes such  defense, the indemnified party shall have
the right to participate in the  defense thereof and to employ counsel, at
its own expense, separate from the  counsel employed by the indemnifying
party, it being understood that the  indemnifying party shall control such
defense.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) If  the  indemnifying party, within a reasonable time after notice of
any such  Third-Party Claim, fails to defend the indemnified party against
which such  Third-Party Claim has been asserted, the indemnified party shall
(upon further  notice to the indemnifying party) have the right to undertake
the defense,  compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim for the
account and risk  of  the indemnifying party; and

 

 

(c) Any  provision in this Article XI to the contrary notwithstanding, (A) if
there  is a  reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may materially
and adversely  affect the indemnified party other than as a result of money
damages or other  money payments, the indemnified party shall have the
absolute right, at its  own  cost and expense, to defend, compromise or
settle such Third-Party Claim;  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that if  such
Third-Party Claim is settled without the indemnifying party\'s consent, 
the  indemnified party shall be deemed to have waived all rights hereunder
against  the indemnifying party for money damages arising out of such Third-
Party Claim;  and (B) the indemnifying party shall not, without the written
consent of the  indemnified party, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim
or consent to  the  entry of any judgment which (i) does not include as an
unconditional term  thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to
the indemnified party  a  release from all liability in respect to such
Third-Party Claim, (ii) subjects  the indemnified party to any injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy or  (iii) includes a statement or admission
of fault, culpability or failure to  act  by or on behalf of any indemnified
party.

 

 

11.8 _Net  Payments_. 

 

 

(a) Any  indemnification payable pursuant to this Article XI shall be net of
any amounts  actually recovered (after deducting related costs and expenses)
by the  indemnified party for the Damages for which such indemnification
payment is  made, under any warranty or indemnity from any third party.

 

 

(b) If  the  indemnified party determines not to pursue any such recovery,
the indemnified  party shall promptly so notify the indemnifying party, and
the indemnifying  party (in its name or in the name of the indemnified party)
shall be entitled  to  pursue such recovery directly and the indemnified
party shall use reasonable  efforts to cooperate with the indemnifying party
in its pursuit of such  recovery, _provided_   that (x)  such recovery
shall not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the  business of the
indemnified party and (y) the indemnifying party shall defend,  indemnify and
hold harmless the indemnified party from and against, and shall  pay or
reimburse the indemnified party for, any Damages which it may incur  or to 
which it may be subjected, resulting from or arising out of or otherwise
based  upon the indemnifying party\'s efforts to pursue any such recovery.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.9 _Sole  Remedy_.  Buyer  acknowledges and agrees that its sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to  any  and all claims, including, without
limitation, Buyer Claims (whether Third-Party  Claims or otherwise), relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement shall  be  pursuant to the
provisions set forth in this Article XI other than in the event  of actual
fraud. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer hereby waives, to the  fullest
extent permitted under Applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and  causes
of action it may have against Seller or the Company arising under any 
federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation 
(including, without limitation, any such right, claim or cause of action
arising  under or based upon common law or otherwise) other than in the event
of actual  fraud.

 

 

11.10 _Environmental  Indemnification_.  In  addition to Seller\'s
obligations set forth in Section 11.2, Seller shall defend,  indemnify and
hold harmless Buyer and its officers, directors, employees, agents  and
affiliates (including the Company, from and after the Closing) at any time 
after the Closing, from any (i) actions required under applicable
Environmental  Laws (including the Connecticut State Transfer Act) relating
to the  investigation, remediation, monitoring, closure and post-closure
obligations  for  environmental conditions existing prior to the Closing
Date at the Barkhamsted  Site, the Bloomfield Warehouse, the Ovation Site, or
any property that Seller,  the Company or any Subsidiary formerly owned or
operated (collectively, the  "Environmental Indemnity Sites"), (ii) fines,
charges, penalties or other  regulatory assessments incurred for any non-
compliance with any Environmental  Laws resulting from any environmental
conditions at the Environmental Indemnity  Sites that existed as of the
Closing Date, and (iii) Damages arising from  alleged human exposure to
Hazardous Substances at the Environmental Indemnity  Sites prior to the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims made  under this Section
11.10 shall be subject to the provisions of Article XI,  including, without
limitation, Sections 11.3, 11.6 and 11.7, except that the  Threshold
described in Section 11.3 shall not apply. Any remedial or other  actions
conducted hereunder shall employ the most cost-effective, commercially 
reasonable methods which may include, where applicable, commercial or
industrial  cleanup standards, deed restrictions, institutional controls,
natural  attenuation and risk assessments.

 

 

11.11 _Exclusive  Remedy for Taxes_.  The  foregoing provisions of this
Article XI shall not apply to indemnification  with  respect to Taxes, which
shall be governed solely by Article VII.

 

 

11.12 _Tax  Treatment_.  All  indemnity payments made pursuant to Article
VII and this Article XI shall be  treated as an adjustment to Purchase Price
for all tax purposes. Any such  payment made to an indemnified party pursuant
to this Agreement shall be  reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal
to the present value of any  tax  benefits net of the present value of any
tax detriments realized by such  indemnified party by reason of the liability
giving rise to the payment or  by  reason of such indemnity payment. The
present value of tax benefits or tax  detriments projected to be allowed in
years subsequent to such liability shall  be determined by discounting such
tax benefits or tax detriments, as the case  may be, back from the end of
each year in which such benefits or detriments  are  projected to be allowed
(or incurred) to the end of the year of such liability,  using an annual
discount rate of 6.5%.

(1)  With  regard to the FlexForm, Informix, Cognos, VSI-Fax and Fourgen
software products  listed in row 11 of Schedule 2.1, as soon as reasonably

the extent that any additional fees are requested  by these providers for
such consents, Buyer will pay all such fees; provided  that Seller involves
Buyer in the negotiations for such fees and Buyer consents  to the fees to be
paid; provided further that if Buyer does not consent to  paying a particular
fee, then Seller shall be relieved of its obligation  to  provide the
Services with respect to that particular software.

 

 

(3)  With  regard to any other software products as to which Seller has
agreed to provide  Services pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent that
consents are necessary  for Seller to provide the Services in respect of such
software pursuant to  this  Agreement, Seller will use reasonable best
efforts to obtain such consents,  and  to the extent that any additional
fees are requested by these providers for  such  consents, Buyer will pay
all such fees; provided that Seller involves Buyer  in  the negotiations for

particular software.

 

 

In  the  event that any such consent referred to above where Seller is
required to  use  reasonable best efforts to obtain such consent, is not
obtained despite Seller  using such efforts to obtain the consent, the
parties shall discuss in good  faith, as applicable, alternative arrangements
or modifications to the Services  in order to meet a mutually agreed
alternative standard. All costs associated  with such consents, alternative
arrangements and modifications shall be borne  by  Buyer solely, provided

fees to be paid to a third party and shall afford  Buyer  the opportunity to
procure alternative arrangements.

parties to provide  all or part of any Service or the Services. In the event
of any subcontracting,  Seller shall remain liable for (i) the provision of
the Services in accordance  with this Agreement, and (ii) all conduct of the
subcontractors, and Buyer  shall  retain all its rights under this Agreement
in relation to such Services,  on the  same basis as if such subcontracted
Services were being provided directly  by  Seller.

3

other than the  Company and the Subsidiaries.

conversions on its behalf.

and/or any  of the  Subsidiaries, if they cease being Affiliates of Buyer.

suspend  the  provision of the Services (or any part thereof), from time to
time, to enable  it  to perform routine or emergency maintenance to those
parts or components  of  buildings, plant, machinery, information technology
systems, or other assets  of  Seller required to provide the Services,
provided that: (i) Seller shall  perform  such routine maintenance outside
of the normal business hours of Buyer, the  Company and the Subsidiaries;
(ii) Seller shall provide Buyer and the Company  with reasonable prior notice
of such suspension and the anticipated duration  of  the suspension, in each
case to the extent practicable; (iii) Seller shall  use  commercially
reasonable efforts to carry out the applicable maintenance and  resume
provision of the relevant Services efficiently and promptly; and (iv)  Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid any unnecessary

enable  Seller to provide routine maintenance shall be consistent with past
practice  of  Seller with respect to the Services.

Section  2.6 _Failures  to Meet the Service Standards_ : It shall not be
deemed to be a breach of this  Agreement if Seller fails to meet the Service
Standards because of:

 

 

(a) Changes  in technology used to provide a Service, which technology is
also used by  Seller  in connection with its provision of a service to
itself or to one or more  of its  Affiliates, provided that such impact on
the Service Standards is not otherwise  reasonably avoidable by Seller. In
the event that Seller anticipates such  a  change in technology that would
reasonably be expected to degrade the quality  and level of Services below
the Service Standards, Seller shall use reasonable  best efforts to maintain
the quality and level of Services in accordance  with  the Service Standards
by either: (i) securing the technology from another  third  party provider,
or (ii) securing alternative technology. If Seller is  nonetheless unable to
maintain the quality and level of Services in accordance  with the Service
Standards, it shall inform Buyer of such change and the  parties  shall
discuss in good faith modifications to the Services in order to meet  a 
mutually agreed alternative standard. If such changes in technology were 
initiated by Seller (other than in response to requirements of Buyer, the 
Company or a third party), then Seller shall bear all costs associated with 
such  alternative arrangements. If such changes in technology were not
initiated  by  Seller (or were initiated by Seller in response to
requirements of Buyer,  the  Company or a third party), then Buyer shall
bear all costs associated with  such  alternative arrangements as follows:
(i) to the extent feasible, Buyer will  purchase the technology itself for
its own benefit, and will pay to the third  party technology provider
directly the costs for and retain said technology;  or  (ii) if given the
nature of the technology it is not feasible or desirable  for  Buyer to
purchase the technology itself for its own benefit, then Seller  shall 
negotiate for the purchase of the technology at favorable rates and may pass 
on  to Buyer any and all costs charged by the third party technology
provider  for  such purchase, to the extent that Seller would not otherwise
have incurred  such  costs for its own business or the business of its
Affiliates, provided that  Seller shall first obtain Buyer's consent, not to
be unreasonably withheld,  prior to incurring any costs to be passed on to
Buyer; and (iii) if Seller  is  required by a third party vendor to
implement the change in technology for  itself or any of its Affiliates, then
the cost passed on to Buyer will be  prorated accordingly.

 

 

(b) Emergencies  or other exceptional circumstances affecting Seller\'s own
business or the  business of its Affiliates which require the allocation of
resources normally  used for the provision of the Services, provided that
such emergencies or  exceptional circumstances could not have been reasonably
foreseen or avoidable,  and limited to the duration of the emergency. In the
event that such emergency  or exceptional circumstance occurs, Seller shall
inform Buyer and the Company  of  such emergency or exceptional circumstance
in accordance with past practice  and  the parties shall discuss in good
faith the manner in which the Services  will be  provided until the
emergency or exceptional circumstance is solved. During  such  discussions
Seller shall, consistent with past practices, use reasonable  best  efforts
to resume providing the Services in accordance with the Service  Standards as
soon as reasonably practicable. All costs associated with such  arrangements
shall be borne by Seller solely.

 

 

(c) Force  Majeure Events described  in Section 9.1,  which  do not give
rise to the termination of this Agreement under Section 4.3(c). 

 

 

Section  2.7 _Cooperation_

 

 

(a) Each  party will perform all obligations under this Agreement in good
faith and  use  reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other in order to
facilitate the  provision and receipt of the Services.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Without  limiting the foregoing, and subject to Section  7.2,  (i) 
Buyer and the Company shall follow the reasonable workplace, security and 
data  privacy policies, procedures and practices of Seller as applicable to
the  Services to the extent that the Company was obligated to follow such
policies,  procedures and practices prior to the Closing, and (ii) Seller
shall follow  the  reasonable workplace, security and data privacy policies,
procedures and  practices of the Company as applicable to the Services to the
extent that  Seller  was obligated to follow such policies, procedures and
practices prior to  the  Closing; provided in the case of (i) and (ii)
above, that none of the foregoing  parties shall be obligated to follow any
policies, procedures and practices  to  the extent in doing so it would be
in violation of Applicable Law, provided  that  the foregoing shall in no
way limit a party's obligations to obtain consents  pursuant to Section
2.3(c). Seller represents and warrants that, to the  knowledge of Seller,
none of the foregoing policies, procedures and practices  violate any
Applicable Law.

 

 

(c) Buyer  and  the Company shall provide Seller and its employees, agents,
consultants and  contractors reasonable access at reasonable times to
facilities, hardware,  equipment, systems, Intellectual Property and related
items and personnel  of  Buyer and the Company, at no cost to any Seller, as
is reasonably necessary  in  order for such Seller to provide such Services
pursuant to the terms hereof;  provided, however, that (i) Seller shall
ensure that all such employees,  agents,  consultants and contractors comply
with the Company's reasonable workplace,  security and data privacy policies,
procedures and practices to the extent  that  Seller was obligated to follow
such policies, procedures and practices prior  to  the Closing; (ii) Seller
shall ensure that all commercially reasonable efforts  are made to avoid and
mitigate any interruption of or interference with Buyer\'s  and the Company's
business activities; and (iii) all such access shall be  subject to any legal
or contractual obligations of the Company.

 

 

(d) A  failure  of Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer or the Company, on the
other hand, to  act  in accordance with this Section 2.7 that prevents or
materially inhibits  the  other party(s) ability to provide a Service or
meet its obligations hereunder,  including the failure to comply with
security policies, practices or procedures  with which it is obligated to
comply hereunder, shall relieve such party(s)  from  such obligation until
such time as the failure has ceased, provided that  the  foregoing shall not
apply to relieve Seller of an obligation to provide a  Service to the extent
that such failure existed immediately prior to Closing  and  Seller provided
such Service notwithstanding such failure.

 

 

(e) Seller  shall, or shall cause its relevant Affiliates to, provide Seller
with  introductions to its contacts at Seller's or its Affiliates' third
party  providers from which Buyer or the Company will procure services in
connection  with the transition of Services to the Music Business after
Closing, and  will,  subject to applicable confidentiality obligations,
provide information to  Buyer  and the Company regarding the services it
receives from such third parties,  and  will use reasonable good faith
efforts to facilitate Buyer's negotiations with  such providers for such
Services.

 

 

Section  2.8 _Divestiture,  Sale or Transfer of Assets_.  Nothing  in this
Agreement shall be deemed to limit Seller\'s ability to divest, sell  or 
otherwise transfer any of its assets, including contracts and Intellectual 
Property licenses, necessary to provide the Services; provided, that
Seller\'s  obligation to provide or cause to be provided the Services to
Buyer in  accordance with this Agreement for the duration of the Term shall
not be  abrogated or affected thereby.

Section  2.9 _Compliance  with Law_.  Each  party shall perform all of its
obligations hereunder in accordance with  applicable Law.

 

 

**ARTICLE  III**

 

 

**_PRICING_**

 

 

Section  3.1 _Payment  for Services_.  As  compensation for the Services
and the Disengagement Assistance, Buyer shall  pay  Seller (a) a resource
unit fee, as further described in Schedule 3.1, (b)  an  amount equal to
Seller's out-of-pocket expenses incurred that are directly  attributable to
providing the foregoing (including pro-rata shares of expenses  incurred in
connection with providing the foregoing as well as providing  services to
other Seller businesses), and (c) to the extent that the level  of  effort
exerted by Seller in connection with providing the foregoing exceeds  the 
level of effort exerted by Seller to provide the same service to the Company 
immediately prior to the Closing as explained in Schedule 3.1, an
incremental  charge as shown in Schedule 3.1, ((a), (b) and (c),
collectively, the  " _Fees_ "). In the event that Buyer terminates any
Service, the applicable  fee for that Service will be prorated on the next
invoice for the actual  time  the Service was provided, and such fee will be
eliminated from all future  invoices. If Buyer exercises its option to renew
this Agreement in accordance  with Section 4.1, the Fees may be increased for
the renewal term by an amount  not to exceed ten percent (10%) over the
existing Fees.

 

 

Section  3.2 _Taxes_.  In  addition to the other amounts payable under this
Agreement, for any Services  for  which Seller charges Fees hereunder, Buyer
and/or the Company, as the case  may  be, shall be obligated to pay, or
reimburse Seller for, the amount of any  present or future Taxes levied
against, upon or in respect of the Services  and/or payable by Seller on
amounts earned (if any, including the full amount  of  any interest or
penalties levied upon any such amounts, to the extent the  interest or
penalties result from the failure by Buyer and/or the Company,  to  pay
Seller any amounts pursuant to this Section 3.2 when due) in connection 
with  the provision of any Services or to the use of such Services by Buyer,
other  than Taxes associated with Seller's income, property or employment.
Invoices  issued pursuant to Section 3.3 shall separately state any taxes
payable by  Buyer  and/or the Company, as the case may be. Seller shall
ensure that all Taxes  withheld by it are timely and properly paid to the
relevant taxing authority,  and shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
the Company for any failure  to  do so (if any, including the full amount of
any interest or penalties levied  upon any such amounts).

 

 

Section  3.3 _Billing  and Cash Settlement_.  Any  amounts due under this
Agreement shall be billed and paid for in the following  manner: (i) Seller
shall invoice the Company on a monthly basis for all Services  delivered
during the preceding month, including one twelfth of any amounts  expressed
in Schedule 3.1 as annual charges, and all Taxes incurred in the  preceding
month; (ii) each such undisputed invoice shall be payable within  thirty (30)
days of the Company\'s receipt thereof; and (iii) payment of all  invoices in
respect of the Services provided hereunder shall be made in U.S.  Dollars ($)
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such  account or
accounts as may be designated from time to time by Seller. In  the  event
that Buyer and/or the Company fails to pay in full any invoice when  due, 
interest shall accrue daily on the unpaid and undisputed amount, as well  as
any  disputed amounts that subsequently are determined to have been properly
invoiced  and due to Seller, until such amounts are paid. The applicable
interest rate  shall be 12% per annum.

**ARTICLE  IV**

 

 

**_TERM;  TERMINATION_**

 

 

Section  4.1 _Term;  Renewal Option_.  The  initial term of this Agreement
shall commence on the Closing Date and shall  end  on the one year
anniversary date thereafter, provided that, Buyer shall have  the  option to
renew the term for one additional year exercisable by written notice  to
Seller not less than 30 days before the expiration of the initial term 
(the  initial and renewal terms are collectively referred to as the
"Term").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Term of this Agreement will end
before  the  term described in the previous sentence with respect to any
particular system  application on that date that it has been installed in the
Buyer\'s system  hardware (a "Migration") and all Seller\'s responsibilities
under this Agreement  shall end with respect to such system application on
each such date, so long  as  the Company no longer needs such assistance
from Seller and has informed  Seller  of the same in writing. The Fees
charged by Seller shall then be reduced  by the  amount applicable to such
Services that end, and if Buyer and/or the Company  had  prepaid any such
amounts, those amounts shall be credited towards future  invoices or refunded
at Buyer's discretion.

 

 

Section  4.2 ___Partial  Termination of the Services_ : To the extent that a
portion of the Services  can be terminated without requiring termination of
all Services, without  causing  a material disruption to the services
provided by a third party, Seller will,  at  a mutually agreeable time no
less than 10 days or more than 30 days after  Buyer  gives written notice,
cease performance of any Service or Services as to  which  Buyer has given
notice that it no longer wants to use. As from the moment  such  Service(s)
cease, the Fees shall be appropriately reduced, and if Buyer and/or  the
Company had prepaid any such amounts, those amounts shall be credited 
towards future invoices or refunded at Buyer's discretion. ****

 

 

Section  4.3 _Termination  of the Agreement_.  This  Agreement or any
Service hereunder may also be terminated:

 

 

(a) By  either  Seller or Buyer upon written notice to the other party if

Agreement;  provided, however, that the breaching party shall have thirty
days from receipt  of written notice thereof to cure such breach, at which
time this Agreement  or  Service, as applicable, shall terminate upon
written notice if the breach  has  not been cured;

 

 

(b) By  the  party not relying upon Section 9.1 to excuse performance, upon
written notice  to  the other party, if  performance of this Agreement or
any Service has been rendered impossible  or  impracticable for a period of
sixty (60) days as a direct result of the  occurrence of any Force Majeure
Event described in Section 9.1;

 

 

(c) By  Buyer  with regard to a portion of the Services as provided under
Section  4.2.

 

 

Section  4.4 _Effect  of Termination_.  Upon  any termination of this
Agreement, neither party will have any further  obligation to the other
(including with respect to the provision of any  Services), except:

 

 

(a) No  termination of this Agreement will prejudice any claim either party
may have  under this Agreement that arises prior to the effective date of
such  termination;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Such  termination will not terminate or otherwise affect (i) any
obligations to  pay  monies due or which become due for Services performed
prior to the date of  expiration or termination; (iii) the provisions of
Articles V, VI, VII, VIII  and  IX; and/or (iii) any other obligations under
this Agreement which specifically  survive or are to be performed after the

the right to access and use, and to access and  use  such Systems only to
the extent reasonably necessary to provide or to receive  the Services, as
the case may be.

 

 

Section  7.3 _Remedies_ _._   The parties acknowledge, understand and agree
that a breach of this Article  VII  may cause irreparable injury to the non-
breaching party and that there may  be no  adequate or complete remedy at
law is available for such breach. Accordingly,  the parties (i) agree that

VII by injunction and (ii) irrevocably waive  any  defense based on the
adequacy of the remedy at law which might be asserted  as a  bar to such

interrupted or suspended, by reason of events beyond  its reasonable control
(which may include without limitation acts of God,  fire,  explosion,

Event. The duties and obligations  of the Buyer, and the duties and
obligations of Seller with regard to the  Services hereunder, that are
directly affected by such Force Majeure Event  shall  be tolled for the
duration of the Force Majeure Event, but only to the extent  that the Force
Majeure Event prevents the affected party from performing  its  duties and
obligations hereunder and in no event shall such duties and  obligations be
tolled beyond expiration of the Term. During the duration  of the  Force

**A.** Landlord  agrees to maintain (i) insurance against loss or damage to
the Premises by  fire  and such other risks and hazards as are generally
insurable under available  forms of "all risk" insurance policies in
Connecticut as are consistent with the  insurance maintained by Landlord in
connection with (1) the Premises immediately  prior to the date hereof and/or
(2) the remainder of the business campus of  which the Premises is a part at
any given time and (ii) a policy of commercial  general liability insurance
with minimum limits of liability in amounts  comparable to insurance
maintained by Landlord in connection with (1) the  Premises immediately prior
to the date hereof and/or (2) the remainder of the  business campus of which
the Premises is a part at any given time. Tenant shall,  as additional rent
hereunder and on each Rent Payment Date, reimburse Landlord  for all
insurance premiums that Landlord has paid in connection with the  insurance
coverage described in this paragraph, excepting premiums which have 
previously been reimbursed by Tenant.

maintain, or cause to  be  maintained, policies of insurance against loss or
damage to Tenant's personal  property by fire and the risks embraced by
extended coverage, vandalism and  malicious mischief endorsements and from
such other hazards as may be covered  by  then standard all risk insurance
(including specifically flood insurance if  available and if carried for
similar properties under The National Flood  Insurance Program as it may be
changed or replaced, and, if the same shall  be  available from a
governmental agency or corporation and is carried for similar  properties,
damage by war or nuclear action or reaction end radioactive  contamination,
and supplementary perils with backup of sewer and drains and  water main
breaks) all in an amount sufficient to cover full replacement cost  (without
depreciation) of Tenant's personal property and fixtures but in any  event,
in an amount not less than 100% of the then replacement  cost.

 

 

**C.** Tenant  shall furnish Landlord with certificates evidencing the
aforesaid insurance  coverage (including evidence of waivers of subrogation),
and renewal  certificates shall be furnished to Landlord at least thirty (30)
days (or ten  (10) days' in the case of termination for non-payment of
premium) prior to the  expiration date of each policy for which a certificate
was theretofore  furnished.

 

 

**D.** Tenant  shall not cause or permit any action or condition that would
(i) invalidate  or  conflict with Landlord's insurance policies or specific
binding recommendations  of Landlord\'s insurers regarding the Premises, (ii)
violate applicable rules,  regulations and binding guidelines of any
authority having jurisdiction over  the  Premises, (iii) cause an increase
in the premiums of insurance for the Premises,  or (iv) result in Landlord's
insurance companies' refusing to insure the  Premises or any property therein
in amounts and against risks as reasonably  determined by Landlord. If
insurance premiums increase as a result of Tenant's  failure to comply with
the provisions of this paragraph, Tenant shall promptly  cure such failure
and shall reimburse Landlord for the increased insurance  premiums paid by
Landlord as a result of such failure by Tenant.

 

 

**E.** Tenant  shall procure and maintain in force and effect an appropriate
clause in, or  endorsement on, any property insurance covering the Premises
and/or any of  the  personal property, fixtures and equipment located
therein or thereon and any  business interruption insurance carried by
Tenant, pursuant to which the  insurance companies waive subrogation. Tenant
and Landlord each hereby releases  and will not make any claims against or
seek to recover from the other party  for  any loss or damage to its
property (including personal property) resulting  from  fire or other
hazards customarily covered by general liability or available  forms of "all
risk" insurance policies. The waiver of subrogation in this  paragraph shall
extend to all affiliates of Landlord and Tenant.

 

 

**F.** At  Landlord's request, Tenant shall provide Landlord and/or
Landlord's insurance  carrier access to the Premises to conduct such
inspections of the Premises  as  Landlord's insurance carrier may require.
Such access shall be provided to  Landlord during normal business hours upon
reasonable advance notice. Landlord  shall use  commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize interference with Tenant's permitted  use of the
Premises.

the elements or other  casualty, Landlord shall at its sole discretion
determine if repairs to the  Premises will be made. If Landlord elects not to
proceed with repairs or  restoration then the Lease will terminate as of the
date of the  casualty.

 

 

**B.** Landlord  shall not be liable for any loss of business, inconvenience
or annoyance arising  from any repair or restoration of any portion of the
Premises as a result of  any  damage from fire or other casualty.

express prior  written consent of Licensor, use the Marks in combination with
any name,  Trademark, word (in English or any other language), symbol, domain
name, email  address, letter or design in such a manner as could create a
joint or  combination Trademark that incorporates any of the Marks, provided
that Licensor  acknowledges that "KMC" is not confusingly similar to any of
the  Marks.

 

 

(c) Licensee  shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, in connection
with its use  of  the Marks or otherwise hold itself out as having any
affiliation with Licensor  or any of its Affiliates, except to the extent
required for informational  purposes and in no event in connection with any
marketing or other commercial  activities. Licensor acknowledges and agrees
that, subject to Licensee's  compliance with Section 3(d),  Licensee's use
of the Marks in connection with products and services and the  marketing
thereof consistent with the terms of the license granted in Section  2(a)
will not violate this clause.

 

 

(d) All  uses  of the Marks by Licensee shall, where reasonably practicable,
be accompanied  by  the following legend: "Kaman Music Corporation and the
Kaman name are Trademarks  of Kaman Corporation and are used under limited
license. Kaman Music Corporation  is not affiliated with Kaman Corporation."
The foregoing sentence shall not  apply to any existing inventory, which may
be depleted as is, provided that  Licensee shall, in its reasonably prudent
business judgment, use commercially  reasonable efforts to disclaim any
affiliation with Licensor in such other  manner as is suitable under the
circumstances.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-2-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Licensee  agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to deplete
within the Term  the  inventory of materials existing as of the Closing Date
that bear the  Marks.

 

 

**4.** **_Domain  Name_**.

 

 

During  the Term, Licensor shall maintain on its Internet website at 
http://www.kaman.com a reference to "Kaman Music" in substantially the 
equivalent manner and format as the reference that has appeared on that
website  prior to the Closing, along with (i) an explanation mutually
agreeable to  Licensor and Licensee stating that the Company is a separate
company no longer  affiliated with Licensor; and that Licensor is not
responsible for the content  of any website operated by the Licensee or the
Company; and (ii) a hyperlink  to  http://www.kamanmusic.com and/or such
other domain name or Uniform Resource  Locator ("URL") that may be provided
by Licensee to Licensor in writing from  time to time.

 

 

**5.** **_Ownership;  Effect of Use_**.

 

 

(a) As  between the Parties, Licensor is the sole and exclusive owner of all
right,  title and interest in and to the Marks. Licensee acknowledges that,
other than  the rights and licenses granted herein, Licensee, the Company and
the  Subsidiaries acquire no right, title or interest in and to the  Marks.

 

 

(b) All  goodwill associated with use of the Marks by Licensee, the Company
and the  Subsidiaries shall inure to the benefit of Licensor. To the extent
that any  rights in and to the Marks are deemed to accrue to Licensee
pursuant to this  Agreement or otherwise, Licensee hereby assigns any and all
such rights, at  such  time as they may be deemed to accrue, to Licensor.

 

 

**6.** **_Representations  and Warranties_**.

 

 

(a) Licensor  hereby represents and warrants that: (i) it has registered the
name "Kaman Music  Corporation" as the Company's corporate name in the
jurisdiction in which the  Company is incorporated; (ii) it is the owner of
all right, title and interest  in and to any registrations for the Marks,
"Kaman Music" and "Kaman" in the  jurisdictions in which such Marks are
registered; and (iii) in any jurisdictions  in which the Marks "Kaman Music"
and "Kaman" are not registered, but in which  such marks are used by the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof,  Licensor is not aware of
any third party claim that the use of such Marks  infringes a third party's
rights, and has no reason to believe there is a valid  basis for such claim.

 

 

(b) EXCEPT  AS  EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN THE MARKS ARE LICENSED ON AN "AS
IS" BASIS WITHOUT  WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, AND NO PARTY MAKES ANY
REPRESENTATIONS OR  WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO THE  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR  PURPOSE.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-3-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

**7.** **_Maintenance_**.

 

 

To  the  extent that any of the Marks are registered trademarks of Licensor
as of the  Effective Date, Licensor shall in accordance with past practice
maintain such  trademark registrations during the Term. At Licensor's
reasonable request and at  Licensor's sole cost and expense, Licensee shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates  to, execute any documents reasonably
requested by Licensor to confirm Licensor's  ownership of its rights in and
to the Marks. Licensee shall, and shall cause  its  Affiliates to,
reasonably cooperate with Licensor's reasonable requests in  connection with
the filing, maintenance, renewal, enforcement and protection  of  all
applications and registrations for the Marks, at Licensor's sole cost and 
expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing and without in any way obligating 
Licensor to make such filings (but Licensor will in good faith confer with 
Licensee on such matters), should Licensor at Licensee's request agree to
make  filings in connection with the Marks in jurisdictions or classes for
which  registrations of the Marks were not in effect at the Closing, then the
costs  of  making and maintaining such filings during the Term shall be at
Licensee's sole  cost and expense.

 

 

**8.** **_Term  and Termination_**.

 

 

(a) The  term  of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and
shall continue for  a  period of three (3) years (the " _Term_ ").

 

 

(b) Licensor  may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Licensee in
the event that  Licensee materially breaches any of its obligations under
this Agreement and:  (i) fails to cure such breach within forty-five (45)
days after Licensee's  receipt of written notice thereof, or (ii) fails to
commence a commercially  reasonable program under which to cure in the event
of a breach which may not  reasonably be cured within such forty-five (45)
day period, provided that  Licensee shall take commercially reasonable
efforts to cure such breach as  expeditiously as possible, and that in the
case of paragraph (ii) Licensor  may  terminate this Agreement if Licensee
fails to cure such breach within sixty  (60)  days after Licensee's receipt
of written notice thereof. Licensee may terminate  this Agreement upon no
less than ten (10) days prior written notice to  Licensor.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  Section 8(a), Licensee is permitted to use the name
"Kaman" on a standalone  basis: (i) only in conjunction with inventory
existing as of the Closing Date,  and (ii) for no longer than twelve (12)
months after the date hereof, providing  that if such existing inventory is
depleted prior to the date that is twelve  (12) months after the date hereof,
Licensee\'s right to use the name "Kaman"  on a  standalone basis shall
expire on the date that such existing inventory was  depleted.

**9.** **_Effect  of Termination_**.

 

 

Upon  expiration of the license granted in Section 2(a) or termination of
this  Agreement as provided above: (i) any and all rights to the Marks
granted to  Licensee hereunder shall cease and without further act or
instrument revert  to  Licensor; and (ii) Licensee shall terminate all
further use of the  Marks.

 

 

**10.** **_Indemnification  and Liability_**.

 

 

(a) Licensor  shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensee, its
Affiliates and their  respective officers, directors, employees and agents
("Licensee Indemnified  Parties") from and against any and all Damages
asserted against, resulting to,  imposed upon or incurred by a Licensee
Indemnified Party by reason of or  resulting from any claim, action, cause of
action, suit, proceeding or  investigation brought or threatened by any third
party arising out of or  resulting from (i) Licensee's use of the Marks in
compliance with the license  set forth in Section 2(a) hereof, including any
claims that such use infringes,  violates or misappropriates the rights of
any third party, or (ii) from any  product or service sold prior to, or
inventory existing as of, the Closing  Date,  _provided_   that  Licensor
shall have no obligation to indemnify any Licensee Indemnified Party  for any
Damages arising out of (x) facts or circumstances that constitute a  breach
of any of the representations or warranties of Licensee set forth in  Article
IV of the SPA, (y) any claim arising out of Licensee's material breach  of
the license granted in Section 2(a), or (z) defects in any new product or 
service offered by Licensee after the Closing Date that bears the Marks. The 
foregoing indemnity shall not apply, and Licensor shall not be obliged to 
defend, indemnify or hold harmless, any of the Licensee Indemnified Parties 
from  or against any Damages asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or
incurred  by them that arises out of or results from Licensee\'s use of any
Mark in any  territory that the Company and the Subsidiaries have not used
such Mark prior  to  the Effective Date.

 

 

(b) Licensee  shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensor, its
Affiliates and their  respective officers, directors, employees, and agents
("Licensor Indemnified  Parties") from and against any and all Damages
asserted against, resulting to,  imposed upon or incurred by a Licensor
Indemnified Party by reason of or  resulting from any claim, action, cause of
action, suit, proceeding or  investigation brought or threatened by any third
party arising out of or  resulting from (i) Licensee's use of the Marks in
violation of the license  granted in Section 2(a), or (ii) any new product or
service offered by Licensee  after the Closing Date that bears the Marks,
provided that Licensee shall have  no obligation to indemnify any Licensor
Indemnified Party for any Damages  arising out of (x) facts or circumstances
that constitute a breach of any of  the  representations or warranties of
Licensor set forth in Article III of the SPA,  (y) any claim that Licensee's
and its Subsidiaries' use of the Marks after the  Closing, in the same
territories and in connection with the same goods and  services offered as
Licensee and its Subsidiaries used the Marks prior to the  Closing, infringes
the Intellectual Property rights of a third party, or (z)  defects in
products or services sold prior to, or inventory existing as of,  the 
Closing Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-5-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Indemnification  claims shall be governed by the procedure in Sections
11.6 and 11.7 of the  SPA.

circumstances other than those as to  which  it is held invalid or
