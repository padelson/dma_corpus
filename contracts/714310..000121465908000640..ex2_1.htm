registered bank holding company ("Valley") and Greater Community Bancorp, a

RECITALS

 

 

Valley desires to acquire Greater Community, and Greater Community's Board of
Directors has determined, based upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth, that the acquisition is in the best interests of Greater Community and
its shareholders. The acquisition will be accomplished by merging
Greater Community into Valley with Valley as the surviving corporation and,
at the same time, merging Greater Community Bank, a New Jersey state-
chartered commercial bank ("CB") and wholly-owned subsidiary of Greater
Community into Valley National Bank, a national banking association ("VNB")
and wholly-owned subsidiary of Valley, with VNB as the surviving bank, and
Greater Community shareholders receiving the consideration hereinafter
set forth. The Boards of Directors of Greater Community and Valley have duly
adopted and approved this Agreement, and the Board of Directors of
Greater Community has directed that it be submitted to its shareholders
for approval. The Board of Directors of each of CB and VNB shall approve the
Bank Merger (as hereinafter defined) promptly after this Agreement
is executed.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I

1.1. The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time (as hereafter defined), Greater Community shall be merged
with and into Valley (the "Merger") in accordance with the New Jersey
Business Corporation Act (the "NJBCA") and Valley shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). Immediately following the
Effective Time, CB shall be merged with and into VNB as provided in Section
1.7 hereof.

 

 

1.2. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall be considered the same business and corporate entity as each of Valley
and Greater Community and thereupon and thereafter, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of each of Valley and Greater Community
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall
be subject to and be deemed to have assumed all of the debts, liabilities,
obligations and duties of each of Valley and Greater Community and shall have
succeeded to all of each of their relationships, as fully and to the same
extent as if such property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises, debts,
liabilities, obligations, duties and relationships had been originally
acquired, incurred or entered into by the Surviving Corporation. In addition,
any reference to either Valley or Greater Community in any contract or
document, whether executed or taking effect before or after the Effective
Time, shall be considered a reference to the Surviving Corporation if not
inconsistent with the other provisions of the contract or document; and any
pending action or other judicial proceeding to which either of Valley or
Greater Community is a party shall not be deemed to have abated or to have
discontinued by reason of the Merger, but may be prosecuted to
final judgment, order or decree in the same manner as if the Merger had
occurred; or the Surviving Corporation may be substituted as a party to such
action or proceeding, and any judgment, order or decree may be rendered for
or against it that might have been rendered for or against either of Valley
or Greater Community if the Merger had not occurred.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.3. Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation of
Valley as it exists immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be
amended by the Merger, but shall continue as the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until otherwise amended as provided by law.

in form and substance satisfactory to Valley and Greater Community, with the
Department of Treasury of the State of New Jersey (the "Certificate
of Merger"). The Certificate of Merger shall specify as
the "Effective Time" of the Merger a date and time following the Closing
agreed to by Valley and Greater Community (which date and time the parties
currently anticipate will be the close of business on the Closing Date).

CB and VNB shall vest in the Surviving Bank and the Surviving Bank shall be
subject to and be deemed to have assumed all of the debts, liabilities,
obligations and duties of each of CB and VNB and shall have succeeded to all
of each of their relationships, fiduciary or otherwise, as fully and to the
same extent as if such property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
debts, liabilities, obligations, duties and relationships had been originally
acquired, incurred or entered into by the Surviving Bank. Upon the
consummation of the Bank Merger, the articles of association and bylaws of
VNB shall become the articles of association and bylaws of the Surviving
Bank, the officers and employees of VNB and the officers and employees of CB
shall be the officers and employees of the Surviving Bank with such additions
as officers as the Board of Directors of VNB shall determine, and the
directors of VNB shall be the directors of the Surviving Bank. Within two
weeks of the date of execution of this Agreement, Greater Community and
Valley shall cause the Boards of Directors of CB and VNB, respectively to

ARTICLE II

 

 

CONVERSION OF GREATER COMMUNITY COMMON STOCK

 

 

Each share of common stock, $0.50 par value per share, of Greater Community
("Greater Community Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, including, without limitation any shares of restricted
Common Stock issued and outstanding pursuant to Greater Community's 2006
Long-Term Stock Compensation Plan, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted or cancelled at
the Effective Time in accordance with this Article II.

 



 

2.1 Conversion of Greater Community Common Stock; Exchange Ratio; Cash in
Lieu of Fractional Shares. (a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other
provisions of this Section 2.1 and Section 2.2, each share of Greater
Community Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares (as such term is
hereinafter defined)), shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Greater Community, Valley or the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding and shall be converted into and become the right to receive, (i)
0.95 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of no par value common stock of Valley
("Valley Common Stock") plus (ii) 0.10 of a warrant to purchase Valley Common
Stock (the "Warrants") at a price per share equal to the Average Closing
Price plus $2.00 per share (the "Exercise Price"). Each Warrant shall be
exercisable for a period beginning two years after the Effective Time and
ending seven years from the Effective Time in accordance with the warrant
agreement (the "Warrant Agreement") and form of Warrant attached hereto as
Exhibit B. No fractional shares of Valley Common Stock will be issued, and
in lieu thereof, each holder of Greater Community Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional interest will receive an amount
in cash determined by multiplying such fractional interest by the Average
Closing Price as defined below. No fractional Warrants shall be issued. In
lieu of fractional Warrants, Valley shall pay to each Greater Community
shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional Warrant
an amount in cash equal to (A) the fair market value of the Warrant as agreed
by the respective Chief Executive Officers of Valley and Greater Community,
based on all relevant factors, including the Black-Scholes model, which model
shall take into account a discount with regard to the lack of exercisability
of the Warrant for the first two years, multiplied by (B) the fraction of a
Warrant such Greater Community shareholder would otherwise have been entitled
to receive. For purposes of this Section 2.1, the following terms shall have
the following meanings:


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) "Closing Price" shall mean the closing sale price of Valley Common Stock
on a Trading Day as supplied by the New York Stock Exchange (as reported in
The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another mutually agreed
to authoritative source).

 

 

(ii) "Trading Day" shall mean a day for which a Closing Price is
so supplied.

 

 

(iii) "Average Closing Price" shall mean the average of the Closing Prices on
the ten (10) Trading Days immediately preceding the date which is five (5)
Trading Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) At the Effective Time, all shares of Greater Community Common Stock held
by Greater Community in its treasury or owned by Valley or by any of Valley's
Subsidiaries (other than shares held as trustee or in a fiduciary capacity
and shares held as collateral on or in lieu of a debt previously contracted)
("Excluded Shares") shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no shares
of Valley Common Stock or Warrants shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(c)  On and after the Effective Time, holders of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Greater Community Common Stock (the "Certificates") shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of Greater Community, except the right to receive the
consideration set forth in this Section 2.1 for each such share held by them.
The Valley Common Stock and Warrants which any one Greater Community
shareholder may receive pursuant to this Section 2.1 is referred to herein as
the "Merger Consideration" and total number of Valley Common Stock and
Warrants which all of Greater Community shareholders are entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 2.1 is referred to herein as the "Aggregate
Merger Consideration".

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if, during the
period from the date hereof to the Effective Time, the shares of Valley
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be
declared with a record date within said period, appropriate adjustments shall
be made to the Exchange Ratio and the Warrants, if necessary, to provide the
Greater Community shareholders with the equivalent value of the Merger
Consideration set forth in Section 2.1.

 

 

2.2 Exchange of Shares. (a) Greater Community and Valley hereby appoint
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company as the exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for purposes of effecting the conversion of Greater
Community Common Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record (a "Record Holder") a
Certificate or Certificates, a letter of transmittal in form mutually agreed
upon by Valley and Greater Community (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Valley Common Stock and Warrants (and cash in lieu of fractional shares and
Warrants) as provided in Section 2.1 hereof.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Upon surrender of Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
executed, the Record Holder shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange
for such Certificates the consideration as provided in Section 2.1
hereof and the Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. The
Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver or cause to be delivered to
any Record Holder the consideration to which such Record Holder would
otherwise be entitled until such Record Holder surrenders the Certificates
for exchange or, in default thereof, an appropriate Affidavit of Loss and
Indemnity Agreement and/or bond as may be required in each case by Valley.
Notwithstanding the time of surrender of the Certificates, Record Holders
shall be deemed shareholders of Valley for all purposes from the Effective
Time, except that Valley shall withhold the payment of dividends from any
Record Holder until such Record Holder effects the exchange of Certificates
for Valley Common Stock and Warrants. (Such Record Holder shall receive such
withheld dividends, without interest, upon effecting the share exchange.)

 

 

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Greater Community of the shares of Greater Community Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and, if
any Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration as provided in Section
2.1 hereof.

 

 

(d) If payment of the consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof is to be
made in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment
that the Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the payment to a person other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 

 

2.3 Stock Options. (a) All options which may be exercised for issuance of
Greater Community Common Stock (each, a "Stock Option" and collectively the
"Stock Options") are described in the Greater Community Disclosure Schedule
and are issued and outstanding pursuant to the Greater Community stock option
plans described in the Greater Community Disclosure Schedule (collectively,
the "Greater Community Stock Option Plans") and the forms of agreements
pursuant to which such Stock Options were granted (each, an "Option
Grant Agreement"). True and complete copies of Greater Community's Stock
Option Plans relating to outstanding Stock Options will be delivered
to Valley promptly after execution of this Agreement. At the Effective Time,
each Stock Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
thereto, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be canceled and all
rights thereunder shall be extinguished and the holder thereof shall only be
entitled to receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.3(b).


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Holders of unexercised Greater Community Stock Options will be entitled
to receive, in cancellation of their Stock Options, a cash payment from
Greater Community immediately prior to the Effective Time, in an amount equal
to the product of (A) the number of shares of Greater Community Common Stock
into which such Stock Options are convertible and (B) the excess, if any, of
(x) the sum of (i) the Average Closing Price times the Exchange Ratio, plus
(ii) the fair market value of 0.10 of a Warrant, based on all relevant
factors, including the Black-Scholes model, which model shall take into
account a discount with regard to the lack of exercisability of the Warrant
for the first two years, over (y) the exercise price per share provided for
in such Greater Community Stock Option (the "Cash Option Payment"), which
cash payment shall be treated as compensation and shall be net of any
applicable federal and state withholding taxes. At the time of receipt of
such cash payment, each holder of a Greater Community Stock Option shall
acknowledge in writing, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Valley that such
cash payment is in full satisfaction of such holder's rights under such
Greater Community Stock Option.

 

 

2.4. Valley Shares. The shares of Valley Common Stock outstanding at
the Effective Time shall not be affected by the Merger, but along with
the additional shares of Valley Common Stock to be issued as provided in
Section 2.1 hereof, shall become the outstanding common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

 

2.5. Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Section 368 of the Code.

 

 

2.6. Changes in Structure. As executed by the parties, this
Agreement contemplates the merger of Greater Community into Valley and the
merger of CB into VNB. In the event that (a) prior to the date on which the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) is mailed to Greater
Community's shareholders, Valley proposes an alternative structure for the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) such alternate structure does not
adversely affect Greater Community's shareholders in any financial respect or
in any other material respect, then Greater Community shall negotiate in good
faith with Valley and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
restructure the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with such
proposal.

of the disclosure schedules required by this Article III, dated as of the
date hereof and referenced to the specific sections and subsections
of Article III of this Agreement, which have been delivered on the date
hereof by Greater Community to Valley or will be delivered pursuant to
Section 5.11 by Greater Community to Valley. Greater Community hereby
represents and warrants to Valley as follows:


 

3.1. Corporate Organization. (a) Greater Community is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of New Jersey. Greater Community has the corporate power and authority to own
or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or in good standing would
not have, or would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined) on
Greater Community. Greater Community is registered as a bank holding company
under The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the "BHCA").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with
respect to Valley or Greater Community, as the case may be, an effect which
(i) is materially adverse to the business, results of operations, assets or
financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis, or (ii) materially impairs the ability of such party and its
Subsidiaries to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely
basis; provided, however, that "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be
deemed to include the impact of (a) changes in laws and regulations affecting
banks or thrift institutions or their holding companies generally, or
interpretations thereof by courts or governmental agencies, (b) changes in
GAAP or regulatory accounting principles generally applicable to financial
institutions and their holding companies, (c) actions and omissions of a
party hereto (or any of its Subsidiaries) taken with the prior written
consent of the other party, (d) the impact of the announcement of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and compliance with this

made to employees at or subsequent to the Closing Date) incurred by the
parties hereto in consummating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and any loss of personnel subsequent to the date of this
Agreement), (e) changes in national or international political or social
conditions including the engagement by the United States in hostilities,
whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or war, or
the occurrence of any military or terrorist attack upon or within the United
States, or any of its territories, possessions or diplomatic or consular
offices or upon any military installation, equipment or personnel of the
United States, unless it uniquely and disproportionately affects either or
both of the parties or any of their Subsidiaries, (f) any change in the value
of the securities or loan portfolio, or any change in the value of the
deposits or borrowings, of Valley or Greater Community, or any of their
Subsidiaries, respectively, resulting from a change in interest
rates generally, or (g) changes relating to securities markets in general
(including any disruption thereof and any decline in the price of any

good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation or organization.

Greater Community has the power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Greater Community. The Greater Community Disclosure Schedule sets forth true
and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation, articles of
association, bylaws or other comparable formation and governing documents
(together the "Charter Documents") of Greater Community and of each Greater
Community Subsidiary as in effect on the date hereof. Except as set forth in

control, directly or indirectly, any equity interest in any corporation,
company, association, partnership, joint venture or other entity and owns no

benefit plan", within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA (the "Greater

of ERISA.

 

 

(b) Greater Community has delivered to Valley in the Greater Community
Disclosure Schedule a complete and accurate copy of each of the following

recent actuarial valuation prepared by such Greater Community Pension Plan's
actuary, did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such plans
allocable to such accrued benefits. To Greater Community's knowledge, the
actuarial assumptions then utilized for such plans were reasonable and
appropriate as of the last valuation date and reflect then current market
conditions.

Plan have been paid. All contributions required to be made to each Greater

liabilities of Greater Community and its Subsidiaries which have not been
paid have been properly recorded on the books of Greater Community and its
Subsidiaries.

 

 

(f) Except as disclosed on the Greater Community Disclosure Schedule, each
of the Greater Community Pension Plans, the Greater Community Welfare Plans
and each other plan and arrangement identified on the Greater Community
Disclosure Schedule has been operated in compliance in all respects with the
provisions of ERISA, the Code, all regulations, rulings and announcements
promulgated or issued thereunder, and all other applicable governmental laws
and regulations. Furthermore, the IRS has issued a favorable determination or
opinion letter, which takes into account the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act and (to the extent it mandates currently applicable
requirements) subsequent legislation, with respect to each of the Greater
Community Pension Plans and Greater Community is not aware of any fact or
circumstance which would disqualify any such plan).

unfunded benefits obligations which are not accounted for by reserves shown
on the Greater Community Financial Statements and established under GAAP, or
otherwise noted on such financial statements.

 

 

(m) With respect to each Greater Community Pension and Welfare Plan that is
funded wholly or partially through an insurance policy, there will be no
liability of Greater Community or any Greater Community Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time under any such insurance policy or ancillary agreement with
respect to such insurance policy in the nature of a retroactive rate
adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other actual or contingent liability
arising wholly or partially out of events occurring prior to or at the
Effective Time.

 

 

(n) Except as may hereafter be expressly agreed to by Valley in writing or as

supplemental retirement plan or arrangement): (i) true and complete copies of

the insurer with respect to the payment, funding or assignment of such
policy. To Greater Community's knowledge, neither Greater Community nor any
Greater Community Pension Plan or Greater Community Welfare Plan owns any
individual or group insurance policies issued by an insurer which has been

Disclosure Schedule lists all examinations of CB conducted by the Department
and the FDIC since January 1, 2005 and the dates of any responses thereto
submitted by CB.

 

 

3.11. Greater Community and CB Information. The information relating to
Greater Community and its Subsidiaries to be provided by Greater Community
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, any filing pursuant to Rule
165 or Rule 425 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") or

conduct of its business under and pursuant to each, and has complied with and
is not in default in any respect under any, applicable law, statute, order,
rule, regulation, policy and/or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating
to Greater Community or any of its Subsidiaries, including, without
limitation, consumer, community and fair lending laws (other than where such
defaults or non-compliances will not, alone or in the aggregate, result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Greater Community) and neither Greater Community
nor any of the Greater Community Subsidiaries has received notice of
violation of, and Greater Community does not know of any violations of, any
of the above.


 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, to Greater Community's knowledge (i) CB
has complied in all material respects with the Community Reinvestment Act
("CRA") and (ii) no person or group would object to the consummation of this
Merger due to the CRA performance of or rating of CB. Except as listed on the
Greater Community Disclosure Schedule to Greater Community's knowledge, no
person or group has adversely commented upon CB's CRA performance.

case, where such invalidity, failure to be binding, failure to so perform or
breach or default, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Greater Community.

subsequent filing), the Greater Community SEC Reports complied, and each such
Greater Community SEC Report filed subsequent to the date hereof will comply,
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and did not or will not, as
the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

control of Greater Community or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including
all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive

with existing assets at regular intervals; and (v) accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. Greater Community (A) has designed disclosure controls and
procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-14(e) and 14d-14(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Greater
Community and its Subsidiaries is made known to the management of Greater
Community by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act with respect to the Greater Community SEC
Reports, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to Greater Community's auditors and the audit committee of
Greater Community's Board (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or
operation of internal controls which could adversely affect in any material
respect Greater Community's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for Greater Community's auditors
any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in Greater Community's internal controls. Greater Community
has made available to Valley a summary of any such disclosure made by
management to Greater Community's auditors and the audit committee of Greater
Community's Board since January 1, 2003. Greater Community is in compliance
with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge
of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Greater Community or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any material
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Greater Community or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (y) no attorney representing Greater Community or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Greater Community or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Greater Community or

Effect on Valley.

Agreement nor the transactions contemplated hereby require the approval of
the shareholders of Valley.

 

 

4.13. Employee Benefit Plans.

materials, the violation of which would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Valley.

upon past loan loss experiences and potential losses in the current portfolio
to cover all known or anticipated loan losses.

manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or reserve policies or its
management, nor has Valley been advised by any Governmental Entity that it is
contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of

discussions or negotiations should be commenced or such information should be
furnished. Greater Community shall promptly communicate to Valley the terms
of any proposal, whether written or oral, which it may receive in respect of

5.5. Access to Properties and Records; Confidentiality.

 

 

(a) Greater Community and CB shall permit Valley and its representatives, and
Valley and VNB shall permit Greater Community and its representatives,
accompanied by an officer of the respective party, reasonable access to their
respective properties, and shall disclose and make available to Valley and
its representatives or Greater Community and its representatives as the case
may be, all books, papers and records relating to their respective assets,
stock ownership, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities,
including, but not limited to, all books of account (including the general
ledger), Tax records, minute books of directors' and shareholders' meetings,
Charter Documents, material contracts and agreements, filings with any
regulatory authority, independent auditors' work papers (subject to the
receipt by such auditors of a standard access representation letter),
litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any other business
activities or prospects in which Valley and its representatives or Greater
Community and its representatives may have a reasonable interest. Neither
party shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where
such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of any
customer or would contravene any law, rule, regulation, order or judgment.
The parties will use their best efforts to obtain waivers of any such
restriction and in any event make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. Greater Community acknowledges that Valley may be involved in
discussions concerning potential acquisitions of banks and other entities and
Valley shall not be obligated to disclose such information to Greater
Community except as such information is publicly disclosed by Valley.

 

 

(b) All information furnished by the parties hereto previously in connection
with transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall be
used solely for the purpose of evaluating the Merger contemplated hereby and
shall be treated as the sole property of the party delivering the information
until consummation of the Merger contemplated hereby and, if such Merger
shall not occur, each party and each party's advisors shall return to the
other party all documents or other materials containing, reflecting or
referring to such information, will not retain any copies of such
information, shall use its best efforts to keep confidential all such
information, and shall not directly or indirectly use such information for
any competitive or other commercial purposes. In the event that the Merger
contemplated hereby is abandoned, all documents, notes and other writings
prepared by a party hereto or its advisors based on information furnished by
the other party shall be promptly destroyed. The obligation to keep such
information confidential shall continue for five years from the date the
proposed Merger is abandoned but shall not apply to (i) any information which
(A) the party receiving the information can establish by convincing evidence
was already in its possession prior to the disclosure thereof to it by the
other party; (B) was then generally known to the public; (C) became known to
the public through no fault of the party receiving such information; or (D)
was disclosed to the party receiving such information by a third party not
bound by an obligation of confidentiality; or (ii) disclosures pursuant to a
legal requirement or in accordance with an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Without limiting the rights provided under Section 5.5(a), each of
Valley and Greater Community, for a period of 45 calendar days following
the date of this Agreement, shall have the right to conduct a full and
complete acquisition audit and to perform such due diligence as it deems
appropriate, using its own officers and employees or third parties, for
purposes of determining whether there is a material breach of any
representation or warranty hereunder or a material adverse change in the
business or financial condition of the other party. Such acquisition audit or
due diligence shall not be limited or restricted by virtue of any audit or
due diligence performed before the date hereof or for any other reason, but
shall not unduly interfere with the business of the other party.

 

 

5.6. Regulatory Matters.

necessary in connection with the offering of the Valley Common Stock and the

reasonable efforts to qualify the offering of such stock and Warrants under
applicable state securities laws at the earliest practicable date. Greater
Community shall promptly furnish Valley with such information regarding
Greater Community shareholders as Valley requires to enable it to determine

business discretion based upon the cost of such listing and the listing
standards. Valley shall make the listing decision as soon as practical and,
if possible, before the Proxy Statement-Prospectus is finalized for mailing.

 

 

(g) The parties hereto will cooperate with each other and use all reasonable
efforts to prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary
filings and to obtain all necessary permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and governmental bodies necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Valley and VNB shall use their
best efforts to cause their applications to the OCC and the FRB to be filed

deliver to Valley within ten (10) days of the date hereof all information
necessary to complete such application as requested in writing by Valley.
Valley shall provide to Greater Community drafts of all filings and

use its reasonable efforts to cause its attorneys and accountants to provide
Valley and any underwriters for Valley with any consents, comfort letters,

registration statements and applications for any such acquisition or issuance
of securities. Valley shall reimburse Greater Community for
reasonable expenses thus incurred by Greater Community should this
transaction be terminated for any reason. Valley shall not file with the SEC
any registration statement or amendment thereto or supplement thereof
containing information regarding Greater Community unless Greater Community
shall have consented in writing to such filing, which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed or withheld.

 

 

(j)   Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Greater
Community shall cooperate with Valley to reasonably conform Greater
Community's policies and procedures regarding applicable regulatory matters,
to those of Valley as Valley may reasonably identify to Greater Community
from time to time, provided that any required change in Greater Community's
practices need not be effected (A) more than five days prior to the Effective

subject to the qualification set forth in Section 5.3 hereof and the right
not to make a recommendation or to withdraw a recommendation if Greater
Community's Board of Directors, after consulting with counsel, determines in
the exercise of its fiduciary duties that such recommendation should not be
made or should be withdrawn, recommend to the shareholders of Greater
Community the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as
practicable, such approval, and (iii) cooperate and consult with Valley
with respect to each of the foregoing matters. Within five days of the date

5.8. Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
satisfy the conditions to the Closing and to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, using reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any
injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the
ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and using its best efforts to prevent the breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such party contained or
referred to in this Agreement and to promptly remedy the same. In case at any
time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors
of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action. Nothing
in this section shall be construed to require any party to participate in any
threatened or actual legal, administrative or other proceedings (other than
proceedings, actions or investigations to which it is otherwise a party or
subject or threatened to be made a party or subject) in connection with
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless such
party shall consent in advance and in writing to such participation and the
other party agrees to reimburse and indemnify such party for and against any
and all costs and damages related thereto.

 

 

5.9. Public Announcements. The parties hereto shall cooperate with each
other in the development and distribution of all news releases and other
public disclosures with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except as may be otherwise required by law or regulation
or as to which the party releasing such information has used its best efforts
to discuss with the other party in advance.

 

 

5.10. Failure to Fulfill Conditions. In the event that Valley or Greater
Community determines that a material condition to its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or
prior to November 30, 2008 (the "Cutoff Date") and that it will not waive
that condition, it will promptly notify the other party. Except for any
acquisition or merger discussions Valley may enter into with other parties,
Greater Community and Valley will promptly inform the other of any facts
applicable to Greater Community or Valley, respectively, or their respective
directors or officers, that would be likely to prevent or materially delay
approval of the Merger by any governmental authority or which would otherwise
prevent or materially delay completion of the Merger.

 

 

5.11. Disclosure Delivery and Disclosure Supplements.

 

 

(a) Promptly, and in any event within ten days of the date hereof, Greater
Community shall deliver to Valley and its counsel a binder containing true
copies of all documents specifically required to be attached as set forth in
the applicable Greater Community Disclosure Schedule. From time to time
prior to the Effective Time, Greater Community shall deliver to Valley and
its counsel true copies of such other documents referred to or described in
the Greater Community Disclosure Schedule, or otherwise, as requested by
Valley and/or its counsel.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) From time to time prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto will
promptly supplement or amend (by written notice to the other) its respective
Disclosure Schedules delivered pursuant hereto with respect to any matter
hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Schedules or which is necessary to correct any information in such Schedules
which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. If the disclosure
contained in any such supplement (i) relates to events occurring before
execution of this Agreement or (ii) alone or together with other supplements
or amendments materially adversely affects the representation to which the
amendment or supplement relates, the party receiving the amendment or
supplement may determine not to accept it as a modification of the
relevant representation. Notice of such determination, if made, shall be
given by the receiving party to the other party not later than 15 days after
it received the disclosure in question. If such notice is not timely given,
or if the disclosure in question did not contain any matter of the
nature specified in clause (i) or (ii) of the second preceding sentence, the
relevant representation shall be deemed modified by the disclosure in the
amendment or supplement with the same effect as though that disclosure had
been included in the relevant Disclosure Schedule as furnished prior to
execution of this Agreement.

 

 

5.12 Transaction Expenses of Greater Community.

 

 

(a) For planning purposes, Greater Community shall, within 30 days from the

the method by which the fees of its investment bankers and counsel in
connection with this transaction are to be determined, and has disclosed to
Valley the fees of its counsel in connection with this transaction through a

costs of investigation, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of legal
counsel and other advisers and experts as incurred), judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement, asserted against, incurred by or
imposed upon any Greater Community Indemnitee ("Costs") by reason of the
fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of Greater Community or
acted as a director or officer of a third party at the request of Greater
Community, in connection with, arising out of or relating to any threatened,
pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative) (each a "Claim" and collectively,
"Claims"), including without limitation any Claim which is based upon, arises
out of or in any way relates to the Merger, this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Greater Community
Indemnitee's service as a member of the Board of Directors of Greater
Community or any committee thereof, the events leading up to the execution of
this Agreement, any statement, announcement, recommendation or solicitation
made in connection therewith or related thereto and any breach of any duty in
connection with any of the foregoing, in each case to the fullest extent
which Greater Community would have been permitted under any applicable law
and its Charter Documents had the Merger not occurred (and Valley shall also
advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent so permitted).

 

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Valley shall assume and honor any
obligation of Greater Community immediately prior to the Effective Time with
respect to the indemnification of the Greater Community Indemnitees arising
out of the Charter Documents of Greater Community or arising out of any
written indemnification agreements between Greater Community and such persons
disclosed in the Greater Community Disclosure Schedule, as if such
obligations were pursuant to a contract or arrangement between Valley and
such Greater Community Indemnitees.

 

 

(c) In the event Valley or any of its successors or assigns (i) reorganizes
or consolidates with or merges into or enters into another business
combination transaction with any other person or entity and is not the
resulting, continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation, merger or transaction, or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person
or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Valley assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 5.14.

 

 

(d) Valley shall cause Greater Community's officers and directors to be
covered, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, at Valley's
option, under (i) Valley's then current officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy (providing substantially similar coverage to Greater
Community's officers and directors such officers and directors had under
Greater Community's existing policy), or (ii) an extension of Greater
Community's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance policy.
However, Valley shall only be required to insure such persons upon terms and
for coverages substantially similar to Greater Community's existing officers'
and directors' liability insurance, and if such coverage over a six year
period would in the aggregate cost more than 200% of the annual premium
currently paid by Greater Community for such coverage, then Valley shall be
required only to obtain such coverage as may be obtained by an expenditure
equal to 200% of the annual premium currently paid by Greater Community for
such coverage.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Any Greater Community Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 5.14 shall promptly notify Valley upon learning of any Claim,
but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Valley of any liability it may
have to such Greater Community Indemnitee if such failure does not materially
prejudice Valley. In the event of any Claim (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time) as to which indemnification under this Section 5.14
is applicable, (x) Valley shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and Valley shall not be liable to such Greater Community Indemnitees for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred
by such Greater Community Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Valley elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for the
Greater Community Indemnitees advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Valley and the Greater Community Indemnitees,
the Greater Community Indemnitees may retain counsel satisfactory to them,
and Valley shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Greater Community Indemnitees as statements therefor are received; provided,
however, that Valley shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 5.14(e)
to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Greater Community Indemnitees in
any jurisdiction with respect to a matter unless the use of one counsel for
multiple Greater Community Indemnitees would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest that is not waivable by the Greater Community
Indemnitees, and (y) the Greater Community Indemnitees will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter. Valley shall not be liable for settlement of any
claim, action or proceeding hereunder unless such settlement is effected with
its prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.14, Valley shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Greater Community Indemnitee
when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that
the indemnification of such Greater Community Indemnitee in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law or public policy.

 

 

5.15.   Employment and Director Matters.

 

 

(a) Following consummation of the Merger, Valley will honor the existing
written employment and severance contracts with officers and employees of
Greater Community and CB that exist on the date hereof and are included in
the Greater Community Disclosure Schedule.

 

 

(b) Before or following consummation of the Merger, Valley will decide
whether to continue each of CB and/or Greater Community's pension and welfare
plans for the benefit of employees of CB and Greater Community, or to have
such employees become covered under a Valley Pension and Welfare Plan.
Subject to the foregoing, following consummation of the Merger, Valley shall
make available to all employees and officers of Greater Community who become
employed by VNB coverage under the benefit plans generally available to VNB's
employees and officers (including pension and health and hospitalization) on
the terms and conditions available to VNB's employees and officers with no
uninsured waiting periods for enrollment in Valley or VNB medical and dental
plans for Greater Community employees and their dependents. No prior existing
condition limitation not currently imposed by Greater Community or CB medical
or dental plans shall be imposed with respect to Valley's or VNB's medical
and dental plans on Greater Community or CB employees. Greater Community and
CB employees shall receive credit for any deductibles paid under Greater
Community and CB existing medical and dental plans. Greater Community
employees will be given credit for voting and eligibility purposes (but not
for benefit and accrual purposes) under Valley's or VNB's medical, life,
vacation, sick leave, disability and other welfare plans for prior service
with Greater Community, and Greater Community's employees will be granted
credit for such prior service with Greater Community, solely for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under Valley's or VNB's 401(k) plan. No Greater
Community employee will be given credit for prior service under Valley's or
VNB's Pension Plan.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)   Valley intends to give priority consideration to Greater Community and
CB Employees for open positions at Valley and its Subsidiaries to the extent
their jobs with Greater Community or CB are eliminated in connection with the
Merger.

 

 

(d)   Following the consummation of the Merger and for one year thereafter,
VNB shall, to the extent not duplicative of other severance benefits, pay
severance to Greater Community and CB employees in accordance with Valley's
written severance policy (except that Greater Community and CB employees will
receive 2 weeks of salary for each year of service without cap) and shall
provide out placement assistance to each employee with a position of Vice
President or above at no cost to such employees, provided, however,
that Valley shall not be required to expend more than $5,000 per employee
with regard to such out placement assistance.

 

 

(e)   Greater Community shall be entitled to name one non-management
director to the Valley Board of Directors, subject to the Valley Board of
Directors' Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee approval process.
Valley shall use its best efforts to take all applicable corporate action to
commence the approval process so that such individual is added to the Valley
Board of Directors upon or promptly following the Closing Date.

 

 

(f)   Each non-management Greater Community director, other than
the individual appointed to the Valley Board of Directors, shall be offered
the opportunity to participate in a Valley regional advisory board which will
be established in the Passaic County, New Jersey area.

 

 

5.16. Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment. Neither Valley nor Greater
Community shall intentionally take, fail to take or cause to be taken or not
taken, any action within its control, which would disqualify the Merger as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 

5.17. Bank Policies and Bank Mergers. Notwithstanding that Greater Community
believes that it has established all reserves and taken all provisions for
possible loan losses required by GAAP and applicable laws, rules and
regulations, Greater Community recognizes that Valley may have
adopted different loan, accrual and reserve policies (including loan
classifications and levels of reserves for possible loan losses). From and
after the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time and in order to
formulate the plan of integration for the Bank Merger, Greater Community and
Valley shall consult and cooperate with each other with respect to (i)
conforming to the extent appropriate, based upon such consultation, Greater
Community's loan, accrual and reserve policies and Greater Community's other
policies and procedures regarding applicable regulatory matters, including
without limitation Federal Reserve, Bank Secrecy Act and FDIC matters, to
those policies of Valley as Valley may reasonably identify to Greater
Community from time to time, and (ii) conforming, based upon such
consultation, the composition of the investment portfolio and overall
asset/liability management position of Greater Community and CB to the extent
appropriate; provided that any required change in Greater Community's
practices in connection with the matters described above need not be effected
(A) more than five days prior to the Effective Time and (B) unless and until
all necessary regulatory, governmental and shareholder approvals and consents
have been received, all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof have
expired, Valley agrees in writing that all conditions precedent to the
Closing have occurred (other than the delivery of certificates, opinions and
other instruments and documents to be delivered at the Closing), and Valley
has provided the Closing Notice. No accrual or reserve made by Greater
Community or any Greater Community Subsidiary pursuant to this subsection, or
any litigation or regulatory proceeding arising out of any such accrual or
reserve, shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach or violation of any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of
this Agreement or to constitute a termination event within the meaning of
Section 7.1(e) or Section 7.1(f) hereof.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.18 Certain Tax Matters. With respect to each compensatory agreement and
arrangement of Greater Community, each Greater Community Pension Plan and
each Greater Community Welfare Plan, in each case subject to Section 409A of
the Code (if any), Greater Community shall amend each such plan or cause each
such plan to be amended to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A
of the Code prior to the Effective Time. Such amendments shall be provided to
Valley and its counsel at least ten days prior to their proposed adoption by
Greater Community or CB and shall be subject to the prior written approval of
Valley, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

 

5.19. Valley Board Observer. From the date hereof, Greater Community and
CB shall provide Valley with reasonable advance notice of any meetings or
other proceedings of the Board of Directors of Greater Community and CB and
Valley shall have the right to have an observer present at any such meetings
or proceedings. Greater Community and CB shall provide Valley and
its counsel with the written minutes of any such meetings or proceedings.

 

 

ARTICLE VI

 

 

CLOSING CONDITIONS

 

 

6.1. Conditions of Each Party's Obligations Under this Agreement. The
respective obligations of each party under this Agreement to consummate the
Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction, or, where permissible under
applicable law, waiver at or prior to the Effective Time of the following
conditions:

 

 

(a) Approval of Shareholders; SEC Registration. This Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been approved by the requisite
vote of the shareholders of Greater Community. The Registration Statement
shall have been declared effective by the SEC and shall not be subject to a
stop order or any threatened stop order.


 

(b) Regulatory Filings. All necessary regulatory or governmental
approvals and consents (including without limitation any required approval of
the OCC and any approval or waiver required by the FRB) required to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained
without any term or condition which would materially impair the value of
Greater Community and CB, taken as a whole, to Valley. All conditions
required to be satisfied prior to the Effective Time by the terms of such
approvals and consents shall have been satisfied; and all statutory waiting
periods in respect thereof shall have expired. Both VNB and CB shall have
taken all necessary action to consummate the Bank Merger immediately after
the Effective Time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Suits and Proceedings. No order, judgment or decree shall be
outstanding against a party hereto or a third party that would have the
effect of preventing completion of the Merger; no suit, action or other
proceeding shall be pending or threatened by any governmental body in which
it is sought to restrain or prohibit the Merger or the Bank Merger; and no
suit, action or other proceeding shall be pending before any court or
governmental agency in which it is sought to restrain or prohibit the Merger
or the Bank Merger or obtain other substantial monetary or other relief
against one or more parties hereto in connection with this Agreement and
which Valley or Greater Community determines in good faith, based upon the
advice of their respective counsel, and taking into consideration insurance
coverage, if any, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Merger because any
such suit, action or proceeding has a significant potential to be resolved in
such a way as to deprive the party electing not to proceed of any of the
material benefits to it of the Merger or the Bank Merger.

and Valley shall have received an opinion of Day Pitney LLP reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to Greater Community and its counsel and

"reorganization" qualifying under the provisions of Section 368 of the Code;
and (ii) no gain or loss will be recognized for federal income tax purposes
to Valley, Greater Community, VNB or CB or to the shareholders of Greater
Community upon the exchange of Greater Community Common Stock solely for
Valley Common Stock and the Warrants. The tax opinions of Day Pitney LLP,

TERMINATION

 



 

7.1 Permissive Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters
presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of
Greater Community:

 

 

(a) by mutual consent of Greater Community and Valley;

 

 

(b) by either Valley or Greater Community upon written notice to the other
party (i) 60 days after the date on which any request or application for a
required regulatory approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the
request or recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such
approval, unless within the 60-day period following such denial or withdrawal
a petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed with the
applicable Governmental Entity, provided, however, that no party shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i)
if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to
the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein or (ii)
if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a
final nonappealable order enjoining (other than on a temporary basis) or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger;

 

 

(c) by either Valley or Greater Community, if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before the Cutoff Date unless the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

 

(d) by either Valley or Greater Community if the approval of the shareholders
of Greater Community required for the consummation of the Merger shall not
have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a
duly held meeting of such shareholders or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof;

 

 

(e) by either Valley or Greater Community (provided that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a
breach of any of the representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the other party, which breach is not cured within 20
days following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing, and which breach
of a representation or warranty, would, individually or in the aggregate with
other breaches, result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the party
committing such breach;


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) by either Valley or Greater Community (provided that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a
material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the other party hereto, which breach shall not have
been cured within thirty days following receipt by the breaching party of
written notice of such breach from the other party hereto, or which breach,
by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing;

 

 

(g) by Greater Community, if Greater Community\'s Board of Directors shall
have approved a definitive agreement reflecting an Acquisition Transaction
(the "Alternative Agreement"), but only if (1) at least 48 hours prior to
entering into the Alternative Agreement, Greater Community provides a copy of
the Alternative Agreement to Valley, (2) the Board of Directors of Greater
Community, after consultation with outside legal counsel and after
considering any response that Valley may have after reviewing the Alternative
Agreement, determines in good faith that approving the Alternative Agreement
is legally necessary for the proper discharge of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, (3) the Board of Directors of Greater Community, after
consultation with its financial advisor and after considering any response
that Valley may have after reviewing the Alternative Agreement, determines in
good faith that the transactions contemplated by the Alternative Agreement
are reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the transaction and the party offering to
enter into the Alternative Agreement, and would, if consummated, be more
favorable to the shareholders of Greater Community than the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and any transaction then being proposed by
Valley; and (4) prior to terminating this Agreement, Greater Community (A)
delivers to Valley a written acknowledgment, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Valley, that upon consummation of the first closing
contemplated by the Alternative Agreement, Greater Community (and its
successors) shall be obligated to pay to Valley the Valley Termination Fee
(as hereinafter defined) and the Valley Termination Expenses (as hereinafter
defined) and (B) delivers to Valley a release signed by the parties to the
Alternative Agreement, which release shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Valley and shall irrevocably waive any right the
releasing parties may have to challenge the payment to Valley of the Valley
Termination Fee and the payment to Valley of the Valley Termination Expenses;

 

 

(h)   by Valley, if an event occurs which may give rise to the payment of a
Valley Termination Fee and/or Valley Termination Expenses pursuant to
Section 7.3;

 

 

(i)   by Valley if the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 are not
satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the Cutoff Date; or

 

 

(j)   by Greater Community if the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1
and 6.3 are not satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied by the
Cutoff Date.

 

 

7.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Valley or Greater Community as provided in Section 7.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect except that
Sections 7.1, 7.3 and 7.4 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

7.3. Valley Termination Fee; Expenses. In the event that at any time after
the date of this Agreement (A) the Greater Community Shareholders Meeting
shall have been adjourned or canceled without the written consent of Valley,
which written consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld with
respect to an adjournment if such adjournment is sought for the sole purpose
of obtaining required Greater Community Shareholder approval of the Merger,
such adjournment not to exceed 45 days, (B) the Board of Directors of Greater
Community shall have publicly withdrawn or modified, or publicly announced
its intent to withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to Valley, its
recommendation, or shall have failed to reconfirm its recommendation, that
the shareholders of Greater Community approve the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (C) Greater Community shall have breached any covenant
or obligation contained in this Agreement and such breach would entitle
Valley to terminate this Agreement, and in any such case this Agreement is
terminated, then Greater Community shall pay to Valley on the date of such
termination an amount equal to the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Valley
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as
itemized by Valley) (the "Valley Termination Expenses"). If such termination
covered by items (A) through (C) above occurs after either (x) a bona fide
Acquisition Transaction shall have been communicated to Greater Community or
(y) after the date hereof, it shall have been publicly announced that any
person other than Valley or any Subsidiary of Valley shall have made a bona
fide proposal by public announcement or written communication that becomes
the subject of public disclosure to engage in a merger, consolidation or
similar transaction with, or a purchase or other acquisition of all or
substantially all of the assets or a majority of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock of, Greater Community, then, in any such case, Greater Community
shall, concurrent with the consummation of an Acquisition Event (as
hereinafter defined) occurring within 12 months after such termination, pay
to Valley (I) a fee of Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000) (the
"Valley Termination Fee") and (II) the Valley Termination Expenses. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Acquisition Event" shall mean the
earlier to occur of (x) the signing of a definitive agreement to enter into
an Acquisition Transaction and (y) the first closing contemplated by an
Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, payment by Greater Community of the Valley Termination Fee shall
be Valley's sole and exclusive remedy against Greater Community and/or its
Subsidiaries, or any officers, directors, employees, representatives or
agents of Valley and/or its Subsidiaries in connection with a termination of
this Agreement under this Section 7.3.

 

 

7.4 Greater Community Termination Fee. In the event that at any time after
the date of this Agreement, Valley shall have willfully and
without reasonable justification breached a covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement and such breach has resulted in a termination of this
Agreement by Greater Community in accordance with Section 7.1(f) (subject to
the right of Valley to cure set forth therein), Valley shall, pay to Greater
Community on the date of such termination an amount equal to Seven Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($700,000) (the "Greater Community Termination Fee").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Greater
Community's sole and exclusive remedy against Valley and/or its Subsidiaries,
or any officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents of Valley or
its Subsidiaries, in connection with a termination of this Agreement shall be
the right to receive the Greater Community Termination Fee.

WITNESSETH

 

 

WHEREAS, Valley and Greater Community Bancorp, a New Jersey corporation and
registered bank holding company ("Greater Community"), have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March [__], 2008 (the

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement provides that (i) Greater Community shall be
merged with and into Valley, (ii) each issued and outstanding shares of
common stock, $0.50 par value per share, of Greater Community ("Greater
Community Common Stock") (other than shares for which the holders thereof
have exercised dissenters' rights) shall be converted into 0.95 of a share of
no par value common stock of Valley ("Valley Common Stock") and 0.10 of a
warrant to acquire a share of Valley Common Stock (a "Warrant"), which
warrants shall be exercisable at a price of $[___] per share of Valley Common
Stock ("Warrant Price"), and (ii) that all validly outstanding options to
acquire Greater Community Common Stock shall be cancelled in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement and that holders of options to acquire
Greater Community Common Stock shall receive the consideration set forth in
the Merger Agreement; and

 

 

WHEREAS, an aggregate of [_____] Warrants shall be originally issued to
holders of Greater Community Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement and this Warrant Agreement, and each Warrant shall represent the
right to acquire one share of Valley Common Stock, subject to adjustment as
described herein; and

 

 

WHEREAS, Valley desires to appoint the Warrant Agent to act on its behalf in
connection with the (i) issuance, transfer and exchange of the certificates
representing the Warrants (the "Warrant Certificates"), (ii) the exercise of
the Warrants by the holders thereof (together with any registered successors
or assigns, the "Holders") and (iii) the adjustment of Warrants upon the
occurrence of certain events as contained herein;

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as

 

 

SECTION 1. APPOINTMENT OF WARRANT AGENT. Valley hereby appoints the Warrant
Agent as its agent to issue the Warrant Certificates, as set forth herein,
subject to resignation or replacement as provided herein. The Warrant Agent
agrees to accept such appointment, subject to the terms and conditions as set

pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and as provided for herein and
to notify Valley's transfer agent to issue the certificates representing the
appropriate number of shares of Valley Common Stock (or other consideration)
upon exercise of the Warrants. Valley agrees to issue and honor the Warrants
on the terms and conditions as herein set forth and to instruct its transfer
agent to issue its Valley Common Stock upon notice from the Warrant Agent of
the proper exercise of any Warrant. The Warrant Agent is hereby empowered to
enforce any rights of the Holders for the benefit of any Holder subject to
the terms and conditions contained herein.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 2. ISSUANCE OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES

 

 

2.1. Form of Warrant Certificate. All Warrants shall issued substantially in
the form of the Warrant Certificate annexed hereto as Exhibit A
attached hereto. The terms of any such Certificate are incorporated herein
by reference.

 

 

2.2. Execution of Warrants. No Warrants shall have been duly and validly
issued until a Holder has received a Warrant Certificate executed by the
Chairman, President and CEO of Valley and the Corporate Secretary of Valley
and such Certificate is countersigned by an authorized officer of the Warrant
Agent. Any Warrant Certificates may be executed by such officers of Valley by
means of a facsimile signature. The Warrant Agent shall maintain the register
of all Holders.

 

 

2.3. Maximum Number of Warrants. Valley hereby authorizes the Warrant Agent
to issue an aggregate of [______] Warrants pursuant to the terms hereof and
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to adjustment as
hereafter provided in Section 4 hereof.

 

 

2.4. Initial Holders. The Exchange Agent (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) shall deliver to the Warrant Agent a list of the names of
the persons who shall be the initial Holders of the Warrants and the number
of Warrants to which each such person is entitled. The Warrant Agent is
hereby authorized by Valley to promptly issue Warrant Certificates for
[_____] Warrants upon receipt of the written request of the Exchange Agent,
which shall include the list referred to in the preceding sentence. Valley
shall deliver to the Warrant Agent, along with this Warrant Agreement, a
sufficient number of duly executed Warrant Certificates. The Warrant
Certificates requested by the Exchange Agent shall be completed and
countersigned by the Warrant Agent and promptly delivered to the Exchange
Agent to be mailed or delivered to the Holders pursuant to the terms hereof
and pursuant to the tens of the Merger Agreement. When requested by the
Warrant Agent, from time to time hereafter, Valley will execute
additional Warrant Certificates in blank for the Warrant Agent to
issue hereunder.

 

 

2.5. Rights Of A Holder. Subject to adjustment as provided herein, each
Warrant shall, evidence the right to purchase one share of Valley Common
Stock at the Warrant Price of $[_____]. Following the Expiration Date, as
defined in Section 3.1 below, the Warrant shall be null and void.

 

 

SECTION 3. EXERCISE OF WARRANT.

 

 

3.1. Exercise Period. The Warrants may be exercised, in whole or in part,
at any time commencing two years after the Effective Time, as defined in the
Merger Agreement, but not later than 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on
[_________], 2015 (the "Expiration Date"). If the Expiration Date is not a
Business Day, it shall automatically be extended to 5:00 P.M. on the next day
which is a Business Day. Business Day means any day other than a Saturday,
Sunday, or holiday on which banks in New Jersey are authorized by law to
close.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-2-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Notwithstanding that the Warrants are not exercisable for two years following
the Effective Time, as defined in the Merger Agreement, the adjustments
provided for in Section 4.1 shall be made and the actions required by Section
4 shall be undertaken.

 

 

Notwithstanding that Warrants otherwise would not be exercisable until two
years after the Effective Time, (i) the Warrants shall be exercisable from
the Effective Time if between the date of the execution of the Merger
Agreement and the Effective Time, Valley is acquired (whether by merger,
stock sale, asset sale or otherwise) by any other person (an
"Acquisition"); (ii) if such an Acquisition is closed after the Effective
Time, the Warrants shall become exercisable immediately upon the date such an
Acquisition is closed; and (iii) the Warrants shall become exercisable
immediately upon the date Valley signs a definitive agreement with respect to
an Acquisition; and (iv) the Warrants shall become exercisable immediately
from the date Valley sends (or should have sent) notice to the Holders of the
applicable record date specified in Section 4.2 or 4.3. In the event that
the Warrants become exercisable prior to two years after the Effective Time,
Valley shall cause notice of the exercisability to be promptly given to the
all Holders.

 

 

3.2. Means of Exercise. In order to exercise a Warrant, the Holder
must present and surrender the Warrant Certificate to the Warrant Agent at
its office, with the Subscription Form on the back of the Warrant Certificate
duly executed and it must be accompanied by payment in full, in the form of
cash, by certified or official bank check payable to the order of Valley or
its successor, of the aggregate Warrant Price for the number of shares of
Valley Common Stock specified in such Subscription Form.

 

 

3.3. Issuance of Valley Common Stock. Upon the request of the Warrant Agent,
Valley shall promptly deliver or cause its transfer agent to deliver a
certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of Valley Common Stock
purchased when any Warrant is validly exercised.

 

 

3.4. Certain Exercise Provisions. If any Warrant is exercised in part only, a
new Warrant Certificate, dated the date of such exercise, evidencing the
rights of the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares of Valley
Common Stock purchasable under such original Warrant shall promptly be issued
to such Holder. Upon receipt of any Warrant Certificate by the Warrant Agent,
at its office, in proper form for exercise and accompanied by payments as
herein provided, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the
shares of Valley Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding
that the stock transfer books of Valley shall then be closed or that
certificates representing such shares of Valley Common Stock shall not then
be actually delivered to the Holder.

 

 

SECTION 4. ADJUSTMENT OF WARRANT PRICE AND NUMBER OF SHARES PURCHASABLE AND
OTHER TERMS IN CERTAIN EVENTS. The Warrant Price and the number of shares of
Valley Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of any Warrant and the other
terms and conditions of the Warrant shall be subject to adjustment and
modification as follows in the circumstances provided:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-3-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

4.1. Declaration of Stock Dividend, Splits, Reverse Splits or
Reclassification or Reorganization.

 

 

(a)  In case Valley shall declare any dividend or other distribution upon
its outstanding shares of Valley Common Stock in Valley Common Stock or
shall subdivide its outstanding shares of Valley Common Stock into a greater
number of shares, then the number of shares of Valley Common Stock which may
thereafter be purchased upon the exercise of any Warrant shall be increased
in proportion to the increase in the number of shares of Valley Common Stock
outstanding through such dividend or subdivision and the Warrant Price per
share shall be decreased in such proportion. In case Valley shall at any time
combine the outstanding shares of its Valley Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares, the number of shares of Valley Common Stock which may
thereafter be purchased upon the exercise of any Warrant shall be decreased
in proportion to the decrease in the number of shares of Valley Common Stock
outstanding through such combination and the Warrant Price per share shall be
increased in such proportion. Valley shall cause a notice to be mailed to
each Holder at least 20 days prior to the applicable record date for the
activity covered by this Section 4.1(a). Valley's failure to give the notice
required by this Section 4.1(a) or any defect therein shall not affect the
validity of the activity covered by this Section 4.1(a).

 

 

(b)   In case Valley shall at any time (i) distribute any rights, options
or warrants to all holders of shares of Valley Common Stock, (ii) issue
other securities to all holders of shares of Valley Common Stock by
reclassification of its shares of Valley Common Stock, or (iii) issue by
means of a capital reorganization other securities of Valley in lieu of the
Valley Common Stock or in addition to the Valley Common Stock, then the
number of shares purchasable upon exercise of each Warrant immediately prior
thereto shall be adjusted so that the Holder of each Warrant shall be
entitled to receive the kind and number of shares or other securities of
Valley which the Holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive
after the happening of the event described above, had such Warrant been
exercised immediately prior to the happening of such event or any record date
with respect thereto. Valley shall cause a notice to be mailed to each Holder
at least 20 days prior to the applicable record date for the activity covered
by this Section 4.1(b). Valley' failure to give the notice required by this
Section 4.1(b) or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of the
activity covered by this Section 4.1(b).

 

 

(c)   An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4.1 shall become effective
immediately after the effective date of such event retroactive to the record
date, if any, for such event.

 

 

(d)   For the purpose of this Section 4.1, the term "shares of Valley Common
Stock" shall mean (x) the class of stock designated as the Valley Common
Stock at the date of this Warrant, or (y) any other class of stock resulting
from successive changes or reclassifications of such shares consisting solely
of changes in par value, from no par value to par value or from par value to
no par value. In the event that at any time, as a result of an
adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4.1, the Holder shall become
entitled to purchase any shares of Valley other than shares of Valley Common
Stock, thereafter the number of such other shares so purchasable upon
exercise of each Warrant and the Warrant Price of such shares shall be
subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly
equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the shares
of Valley Common Stock contained in this Section 4.1.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-4-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

4.2. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Notwithstanding any other
provisions hereof, in the event of the liquidation, dissolution, or winding
up of the affairs of Valley (other than in connection with a consolidation,
merger or sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of its assets
outside of the ordinary course of business), the right to exercise this
Warrant shall terminate and expire at the close of business on the last full
business day before the earliest date fixed for the payment of any
distributable amount on the Valley Common Stock. Valley shall cause a notice
to be sent to each Holder at least 20 days prior to the applicable record
date for such payment stating the date on which such liquidation, dissolution
or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date on which it is
expected that holders of shares of Valley Common Stock of record shall be
entitled to exchange their shares of Valley Common Stock for securities or
other property or assets (including cash) deliverable upon such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up, and that each Holder may exercise outstanding
Warrants during such 20 day period and, thereby, receive consideration in the
liquidation on the same basis as other previously outstanding shares of the
same class as the shares acquired upon exercise. Valley's failure to give
notice required by this Section 4.2 or any defect therein shall not affect
the validity of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

 

 

4.3. Merger, Consolidation, etc.

 

 

(a)   In case of any consolidation with or merger of Valley into
another corporation or sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of its
assets outside of the ordinary course of business (such consolidation,
merger, sale or conveyance, a "Change of Control") then, as a condition of
such Change of Control, lawful and adequate provisions shall be made whereby
the Holders shall thereafter have the right to receive upon payment of the
Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such Change of Control, upon the
basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement
(including but not limited to all provisions contained in this Section 4),
and in lieu of the shares of Valley Common Stock purchasable upon the
exercise of the Warrants, such shares of stock, securities, cash or assets
which such Holder would have been entitled to receive after the happening of
such Change of Control had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to
such Change of Control. The provisions of this Section 4.3 shall similarly
apply to successive Change of Controls. Valley shall cause a notice to be
mailed to each Holder at least 20 days prior to the applicable record
date for the Change of Control covered by this Section 4.3(a) and shall
provide notice of the Change of Control and shall set forth the first
and last date on which the Holder may exercise outstanding Warrants.
Valley's failure to give the notice required by this Section 4.3(a) or
any defect therein shall not affect the validity of the Change of Control
covered by this Section 4.3(a).

 

 

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if as a result of such Change of Control,
holders of Valley Common stock shall receive or be entitled to receive
consideration other than solely in shares of common stock or other securities
in exchange for their Valley Common Stock, Valley may, at its sole option,
fulfill all of its obligations under this Warrant Agreement by causing the
Notice required by Section 4.3(a) hereof to include notice to Holders of the
opportunity to exercise their Warrants before the consummation date of the
Change of Control, and thereby receive consideration in the Change of
Control, on the same basis as the shares which would be acquired upon
exercise of the Warrant, immediately prior to the consummation of the Change
of Control. If the notice specified in the preceding sentence is provided to
Holders, Warrants not exercised in accordance with this Section
4.3(b) before consummation of the Change of Control shall be cancelled and
become null and void on the consummation date of the Change of Control. The
notice provided by the Warrant Agent pursuant to this Section 4.3(b)
shall include a description of the terms of this Agreement providing for
cancellation of the Warrants in the event that Warrants are not exercised by
the prescribed date. Valley's failure to give any notice required by this
Section 4.3(b) for any reason whatsoever or any defect therein shall not
affect the validity of any such Change of Control. The failure of and Holder
to receive such notice shall not void the cancellation of the Warrants and
the Warrants shall nevertheless be cancelled.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-5-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.4. Duty to Make Fair Adjustments in Certain Cases. If any event occurs as
to which in the opinion of the Board of Directors of Valley the other
provisions of this Section 4 are not strictly applicable or if strictly
applicable would not fairly protect the purchase rights of the Holders in
accordance with the essential intent and principles of this Agreement, then
the Board of Directors shall make an adjustment in the application of such
provisions, in accordance with such essential intent and principles, as to
protect the purchase rights of the Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the issuance of Valley Common Stock or any securities convertible into Valley
Common Stock by Valley either for cash or in a merger, consolidation,
exchange or acquisition shall not, by itself, constitute a basis for
requiring any adjustment in the Warrants unless specifically enumerated
herein.

 

 

4.5. Good Faith Determination. Any determination as to whether an
adjustment or limitation of exercise is required pursuant to this Section 4
(and the amount of any adjustment), and any determination of whether a Change
in Control has occurred or will occur, or whether Warrants shall be cancelled
in connection with a Change in Control, shall be binding upon the Holders if
made in good faith by the Board of Directors of Valley (or any successor
to Valley).

 

 

4.6. Notice of Adjustment. Whenever the number of shares of Valley
Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants or the Warrant
Price is adjusted, Valley shall promptly file in the custody of its Secretary
or an Assistant Secretary at its principal office and with the Warrant Agent,
an officer's certificate setting forth the number of shares of Valley Common
Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants, the Warrant Price after
such adjustment, a statement, in reasonable detail, of the facts requiring
such adjustment and the computation by which such adjustment was made. Each
such officer's certificate shall be made available at all reasonable times
for inspection by the Warrant Holders, and the Warrant Agent shall, forthwith
after each such adjustment, promptly mail a copy of such certificate to such
Holders by first class mail, postage prepaid.

 

 

4.7. No Change of Warrant Necessary. Irrespective of any adjustment in the
Warrant Price or in the number or kind of shares issuable upon exercise of
the Warrants, the Warrant Certificates may continue to express the same price
and number and kind of shares as are stated in the Warrant Certificates as
initially issued.

 

 

SECTION 5. SHARES TO BE FULLY PAID; RESERVATION OF SHARES. Valley covenants
and agrees for the benefit of the Holders:

 

 

5.1. That all shares of Valley Common Stock which may be issued upon the
exercise of the rights represented by the Warrant Certificates will, upon
issue and payment of the aggregate Warrant Price therefor, be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free and clear
of all liens and encumbrances, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-6-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.2. That during the period within which the rights represented by the
Warrant Certificates may be exercised, Valley will at all times have
authorized and reserved for the purpose of issue upon exercise of the rights
evidenced by the Warrant Certificates, a sufficient number of shares of
Valley Common Stock to provide for the exercise of the rights represented by
the Warrant Certificates.

 

 

5.3. That Valley will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that
the shares of Valley Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants
may be so issued without violation of any applicable federal law or
regulation, or of any requirements of any securities exchange upon which any
capital stock of Valley may be listed.

 

 

5.4. That Valley has filed a registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission with
respect to the issuance of the Warrants and will file a registration
statement with the SEC with respect to the Valley Common Stock issuable
thereunder prior to the date upon which the Warrants become exercisable.
Valley shall not be obligated to file or comply with the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States of America to permit the Warrants
to be exercised and no Warrant Holder shall have the right to exercise the
Warrants in a jurisdiction where such exercise would be unlawful.

 

 

SECTION 6. EXCHANGE, ASSIGNMENT OR LOSS OF WARRANT CERTIFICATE.

 

 

6.1. Exchange. The Warrants shall be exchangeable at the option of the
Holder, upon presentation and surrender of the Warrant Certificate at the
office of the Warrant Agent for other Warrant Certificates of different
denominations. Any Warrant Certificate may be divided or combined with other
Warrant Certificates into a Warrant Certificate evidencing the same aggregate
number of Warrants.

 

 

6.2. Transfer or Assignment. The Warrants and all rights of Holders thereof
are assignable and transferable in whole or in part by the Holders thereof,
in person or by duly authorized attorney, by surrender of any Warrant
Certificate to the Warrant Agent at its office with the Assignment Form
annexed thereto duly executed and funds sufficient to pay any applicable
transfer tax. In such event the Warrant Agent shall execute and deliver, in
the case of an assignment or transfer in whole, a new Warrant Certificate in
the name of the assignee or transferee, or, in the case of an assignment or
transfer in part, a new Warrant Certificate in the name of such assignee or
transferee representing the number of Warrants so assigned or transferred and
a new Warrant Certificate in the name of the assignor or transferor
representing the number of Warrants not so assigned or transferred.

 

 

6.3. Lost or Destroyed Warrant Certificates. Upon receipt by the Warrant
Agent of evidence satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or
mutilation of a Warrant Certificate, and (i) in the case of such loss, theft
or destruction, of reasonably satisfactory indemnification and bonding, or
(ii) if mutilated, upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant
Certificate, the Warrant Agent shall execute and deliver a new Warrant
Certificate of like tenor. Any such new Warrant Certificate executed and
delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part
of Valley, whether or not the Warrant Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed
or mutilated shall be at any time enforceable by anyone.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-7-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 7. NO ISSUANCE OF FRACTIONAL INTERESTS IN COMMON STOCK. Valley shall
not be required to issue fractional shares of Valley Common Stock on the
exercise of the Warrants. If any fraction of a share of Valley Common Stock
would be issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants (or any specified portion
thereof), Valley shall pay an amount in cash equal to the product of (a) such
fraction and (b) the closing price per share of Valley Common Stock as quoted
by the New York Stock Exchange, or on any other exchange on which the Valley
Common Stock is quoted, on the trading day prior to the date the Warrant is
exercised.

 

 

SECTION 8. NO RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDERS; CERTAIN NOTICES AND REPORTS TO
HOLDERS. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, nothing contained
in this Agreement or in the Warrant Certificates shall be construed as
conferring upon the Holders or any transferees the right to vote or to
receive dividends or to receive notice as shareholders in respect of any
meeting of shareholders for the election of directors of Valley or any other
matter, or any rights whatsoever as shareholders of Valley.

 

 

8.1. Reports. Valley shall transmit to all registered Holders, all reports
and other documents that Valley transmits to holders of shares of Valley
Common Stock generally, at the same time and in the same manner as such
reports and other documents are transmitted to holders of shares of Valley
Common Stock.

 

 

SECTION 9. AGREEMENT OF WARRANT HOLDERS. Every Holder of a Warrant, by his
acceptance thereof, consents and agrees with Valley, the Warrant Agent and
every other Holder of a Warrant that:

 

 

(a) The Warrants are transferable only on the registry books of Valley by the
Holder thereof in person or by his attorney duly authorized in writing and
only if the Warrant certificates representing such Warrants are surrendered
at the office of the Warrant Agent, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper
instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Warrant Agent and Valley in their
sole discretion, together with payment of any applicable transfer taxes; and

 

 

(b) Valley and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name
the Warrant certificate is registered as the Holder and as the absolute, true
and lawful owner of the Warrants represented thereby for all purposes, and
neither Valley nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice or
knowledge to the contrary.

 

 

SECTION 10. DUTIES OF WARRANT AGENT. The Warrant Agent acts hereunder as
agent and in a ministerial capacity for Valley, and its duties shall be
determined solely by the provisions hereof. The Warrant Agent shall not, by
issuing and delivering Warrant certificates or by any other act hereunder be
deemed to make any representations as to the validity, value or authorization
of the Warrant certificates or the Warrants represented thereby or of any
securities or other property delivered upon exercise of any Warrant or
whether any stock issued upon exercise of any Warrant is fully paid and
nonassessable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-8-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

The Warrant Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility
to any Holder of Warrant certificates to make or cause to be made any
adjustment of the Warrant Price provided in this Agreement, or to determine
whether any fact exists which may require any such adjustments, or with
respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment, when made, or with
respect to the method employed in making the same. It shall not (i) be liable
for any recital or statement of facts contained herein or for any action
taken, suffered or omitted by it in reliance on any Warrant Certificate or
other document or instrument believed by it in good faith to be genuine and
to have teen signed or presented by the proper party or parties, (ii) be
responsible for any failure on the part of Valley to comply with any of its
covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement or in any Warrant
Certificate, or (iii) be liable for any act or omission in connection with
this Agreement except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 

 

The Warrant Agent may at any time consult with counsel satisfactory to it
(who may be counsel for Valley) and shall incur no liability or
responsibility for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith
in accordance with the opinion or advice of such counsel.

 

 

Any notice, statement, instruction, request, direction, order or demand of
Valley shall be sufficiently evidenced by an instrument signed by the
Chairman, President and CEO, any Executive Vice President, or the Secretary
(unless other evidence in respect thereof is herein specifically prescribed).
The Warrant Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it in accordance with such notice, statement, instruction,
request, direction, order or demand believed by it to be genuine.

 

 

Valley agrees to pay the Warrant Agent reasonable compensation for its
services hereunder and to reimburse it for its reasonable expenses hereunder
and further agrees to indemnify the Warrant Agent and save it harmless
against any and all losses, expenses and liabilities, including judgments,
costs and counsel fees, for anything done or omitted by the Warrant Agent in
the execution of its duties and powers hereunder except losses, expenses and
liabilities arising as a result of the Warrant Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

 

 

The Warrant Agent may resign its duties and be discharged from all further
duties and liabilities hereunder (except liabilities arising as a result of
the Warrant Agent's own gross negligence or willful misconduct), after giving
30 days' prior written notice to Valley. At least 15 days prior to the date
such resignation is to become effective, the Warrant Agent shall cause a copy
of such notice of resignation to be mailed to the Holder of each Warrant
Certificate at Valley's expense. Upon such resignation, or any inability of
the Warrant Agent to act as such hereunder, Valley shall appoint a new
warrant agent in writing. Valley shall have complete discretion in the naming
of a new warrant agent, who may be an affiliate, subsidiary or department of
Valley, or any person used by Valley as transfer agent for the Valley Common
Stock. If Valley shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 15
days after it has been notified in writing of such resignation by the
resigning Warrant Agent, then the Holder of any Warrant Certificate may apply
to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new warrant
agent. Valley may, upon notice to the Holders, remove and replace the Warrant

After acceptance in writing of an appointment by a new warrant agent is
received by Valley, such new warrant agent shall be vested with the same
powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally
named herein as the Warrant Agent, without any further assurance, conveyance,

successor warrant agent under this Agreement without any further act. Any
such successor warrant agent shall promptly cause notice of its succession as
warrant agent to be mailed to Valley and to each Holder.

 

 

Nothing herein shall preclude the Warrant Agent from acting in any other
capacity for Valley.

not adversely affect the purchase or other material rights of the Holders of
Warrant Certificates. This Agreement shall not otherwise be modified,
supplemented or amended in any respect except with the consent in writing of
the Holders of Warrant Certificates representing not less than 50% of the
Warrants then outstanding, but no such amendment, modification or supplement
which changes the number or nature of the securities purchasable upon the
exercise of any Warrant, the Warrant Price or accelerates the Expiration
Date, shall be made without the consent in writing of each and every Holder
(but no consent shall be required for such changes as are specifically
prescribed by this Agreement as originally executed).

VALLEY NATIONAL BANCORP

 

 

 

 

        | This certifies that  FOR VALUE RECEIVED  |   |   
---|---|---|--- 
      
    or his registered  assigns (the "Holder")  is the registered owner
of  |   |   
      |   |   
      
     

Warrants  ("Warrants")  issued by Valley National Bancorp, a New Jersey
corporation and registered  bank holding company ("Valley").  The Warrants
are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this  certificate and
the Warrant Agreement (as hereinafter defined). Each  Warrant entitles the
Holder to purchase one share of common stock, no par  value ("Valley  Common
Stock"), of Valley, at any time from two years following the  initial
issuance date of the Warrants set forth above until the Expiration  Date (as
hereinafter defined), upon the presentation and surrender of this  Warrant
Certificate with the Subscription Form on the reverse side hereof  duly
executed, at the corporate office of the Warrant Agent (as hereafter 
defined), accompanied by payment of $[____] (the "Warrant  Price") in cash,
by official bank or certified check made payable  to Valley or its successor.
As provided in Section 3.1 of  the Warrant Agreement, the Warrant may also be
exercisable in specified  circumstances during the six month period
commencing with the initial  issuance date.

    
   

 

 

 

This Warrant Certificate and each Warrant represented hereby are issued
pursuant to and are subject in all respects to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Warrant Agreement (the "Warrant Agreement"), dated
________________, 2008 by and between Valley and [_____________] (the
"Warrant Agent"), a copy of which may be obtained from Valley at
[_______________] or the Warrant Agent at [_______________________], by a
written request from the Holder hereof or which may be inspected by any
Holder or his agent at the principal office of Valley or the Warrant Agent.

 

 

As provided in Section 4 of the Warrant Agreement, in certain circumstances:
(i) the Warrant Price and the number of shares of Valley Common Stock the
Holder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of any Warrants may be
adjusted; (ii) the Warrants shall automatically represent the right to
receive upon exercise consideration which is different from or in addition to
the consideration specified on the face of this Certificate; and (iii) the
Warrants, at the option of Valley under certain circumstances, may expire
prior to the Expiration Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

No fractional shares of Valley Common Stock will be issued upon exercise of
the Warrant. In the case of the exercise of less than all the Warrants
represented hereby, Valley shall cancel this Warrant Certificate upon the
surrender hereof and shall execute and deliver a new Warrant Certificate or
Warrant Certificates of like tenor, which the Warrant Agent shall
countersign, for the balance of such Warrants.

 

 

The term "Expiration Date" shall mean 5:00 P.M. (New Jersey time) on
_____________, 2015. If such date is not a Business Day, as defined in the
Warrant Agreement, the Expiration Date shall mean 5:00 P.M. (New Jersey time)
the next following Business Day. The Expiration Date may be accelerated by
Valley under certain circumstances, as provided in the Warrant Agreement.

 

 

This Warrant shall not be exercisable by a Holder in any jurisdiction where
such exercise would be unlawful.

 

 

This Warrant Certificate is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the
Holder at the corporate office of the Warrant Agent, for a new Warrant
Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor representing an equal
aggregate number of Warrants. Upon due presentment of this Warrant
Certificate for registration or transfer at such office, upon payment of any
tax or governmental charge imposed in connection therewith, a new Warrant
Certificate or Warrant Certificates representing an equal or aggregate number
of Warrants will be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor.

 

 

Prior to the exercise of any Warrant represented hereby, the Holder shall not
be entitled to any rights of a shareholder of Valley, including, without
limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends or other distributions,
and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of Valley,
except as provided in the Warrant Agreement.

 

 

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer hereof, Valley and the
Warrant Agent shall treat the Holder as the absolute owner hereof and of each
Warrant represented hereby for all purposes and shall not be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

 

 

This Warrant Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New Jersey.

 

 

This Warrant Certificate is not valid unless countersigned by the
Warrant Agent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Valley has caused this Warrant Certificate to be duly
executed, manually or in facsimile by two of its officers thereunto
duly authorized.
