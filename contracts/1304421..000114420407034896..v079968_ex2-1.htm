Meeting; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  such recommendation may be
withdrawn, modified or amended, in each case,  (x) in  accordance with
Section 6.3(c) or (y) if, other than in connection with an  Alternative
Proposal, the Company's Board of Directors shall have determined in  good
faith (after consultation with the Company's outside counsel) that the 
failure to take such action is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under 
applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that notwithstanding any 
withdrawal, modification or amendment made pursuant to this clause (y), the 
Company shall still be required to hold the Company Shareholders' Meeting 
pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(ii));

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) as  soon  as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus  has been cleared by the SEC and the Parent Registration

incorporated by reference in  the  Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Parent
Registration Statement, any amendment  or  supplement thereto or any other
document filed in connection with this Agreement  or any of the Transactions
with any Governmental Entity (in any such case  to the  extent such
information was furnished by the Company or Parent, as the case  may  be,
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein) (i) at the respective 
times that the applicable document is filed with the SEC or such other 
Governmental Entity and first mailed or otherwise disseminated to the
Company's  shareholders, (ii) in addition, in the case of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus,  at the time of the Company Shareholders' Meeting, and
(iii) in addition, in the  case of the Parent Registration Statement, at the
time the Parent Registration  Statement becomes effective and at the
Effective Time, will not contain any  untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required  to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein,  in  light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not  misleading.

 

 

(d) The  Company and the Company's counsel, and Parent and Parent's counsel,

any written comments or other  material communications that it or its counsel
receives from time to time  from  the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Parent  Registration Statement, with copies of
any written responses to, and telephonic  notification of any material verbal

respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus  or  Parent Registration
Statement, and with notice of any stop order or the  suspension of
qualification of the Parent Stock issuable pursuant to the  Merger  for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction. If at any time Parent or the Company 
shall become aware of the occurrence of any event or other circumstance
relating  to it or any of its Subsidiaries as to which an amendment or
supplement to  the  Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Parent Registration
Statement shall be required,  it shall notify the other party thereof, and
Parent and the Company shall  together, or pursuant to an allocation of
responsibility to be agreed upon  between them, promptly prepare and file
such amendment or supplement with  the  SEC and, if applicable, disseminate
such amendment or supplement to the  Company's shareholders. Neither the
Company nor Parent shall disseminate or file  any such amendment or

and its counsel.

ARTICLE  III

 

TREATMENT  OF SECURITIES

 

 

Section 3.1.  _Conversion  of Capital Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any share of capital stock  of  the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

 

 

(a) _Common  Stock of Merger Sub_.  Each  share of common stock, without
par value, of Merger Sub (" _Merger  Sub Common Stock_ ")  issued  and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted 
into  one newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the  Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b) _Cancellation  of Certain Company Common Stock_.  Each  share of common
stock, par value $0.15625 per share, of the Company  (" _Company  Common
Stock_ ")  that  immediately prior to the Effective Time is owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or  any  other Parent Subsidiary, and each share of Company
Common Stock held in the  treasury of the Company or owned by any Company
Subsidiary, shall automatically  be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist without any conversion thereof,  and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. Shares of Company  Common Stock that are
canceled and retired pursuant to this Section 3.1(b)  are  hereinafter
referred to as the " _Excluded  Shares_ ".

 

 

(c) _Conversion  of Company Common Stock_.  Each  share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to  the  Effective Time
(other than Excluded Shares) shall automatically be converted  into the right
to receive the following consideration:

 

 

(i) Each  share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive  cash  (a " _Cash  Election_ ")  has  been effectively made and
not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 3.2 (each,  a " _Cash  Electing
Company Share_ ")  shall  (subject to Section 3.3) be converted into the
right to receive $25.00 in  cash  without interest (such per share amount is
hereinafter referred to as the  " _Cash  Consideration_ ").

 

 

(ii) Each  share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive  stock  consideration (a " _Stock  Election_ ")  has  been
properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 3.2 (each,  a "
_Stock  Electing Company Share_ " and,  together with each Cash Electing
Company Share, an " _Electing  Company Share_ ")  shall  (subject to
Section 3.3) be converted into the right to receive 1.1061947  validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Stock, subject  to 
adjustment in accordance with Section 3.1(e) (such per share amount,
together  with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock to be
paid pursuant  to Section 3.1(d), is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Parent  Stock Consideration_ ").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Each  share of Company Common Stock that is not (x) an Excluded Share
or (y) a  share  of Company Common Stock with respect to which a Cash
Election or a Stock  Election has been properly made and not revoked or lost
pursuant to Section  3.2  (each, a " _Non-Electing  Company Share_ ") 
shall  be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration or the
Parent  Stock Consideration, as determined pursuant to Section 3.3.

 

 

Effective  as of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded  Shares)  shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired  and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately  prior to the Effective Time represented any
such share of Company Common  Stock  (a " _Certificate_ ")  shall  cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive  the 
Merger Consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance  with Section 3.4. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Merger  Consideration_ " with  respect to a given share of Company Common
Stock shall mean either the Cash  Consideration (with respect to a share of
Company Common Stock representing  the  right to receive the Cash
Consideration) or the Parent Stock Consideration  (with  respect to a share
of Company Common Stock representing the right to receive  the  Parent Stock
Consideration).

 

 

(d) _No  Fractional Shares_.  No  fractional shares of Parent Stock shall
be issued in respect of shares of  Company Common Stock that are to be
converted in the Merger into the right  to  receive shares of Parent Stock.
Each holder of a Certificate (other than  holders  of Certificates
representing Excluded Shares) shall be entitled to receive  in  lieu of any
fractional share of Parent Stock to which such holder would  otherwise have
been entitled pursuant to Sections 3.1(c) and 3.3 an amount  in  cash
(without interest), rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the 
product  obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share of Parent Stock to
which  such  holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account
all shares  of  Company Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior
to the Effective  Time, such holder's unrevoked Cash Elections and Stock
Elections and the  provisions of Section 3.3) by (ii) the average of the
closing price on NASDAQ  for a share of Parent Stock for the five (5)
consecutive trading days  immediately preceding the Effective Time.

 

 

(e) _Adjustments_.  If, on  or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, Parent  pays  a dividend in, splits, combines into a
smaller number of shares, or issues  by  reclassification any shares of
Parent Stock, then the Parent Stock Consideration  and any dependent items
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the  holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated  by this  Agreement prior to
such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after  the  date of such
event, be the Parent Stock Consideration or other dependent  item,  as
applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this  sentence.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  3.2. _Election  Procedures_. 

 

 

(a) Promptly  after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall designate
and appoint  a bank  or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as exchange  agent  hereunder (the " _Exchange  Agent_ ")  for 
the purpose of exchanging Certificates.

 

 

(b) Parent  shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Parent Registration
Statement  a form  of election, and other appropriate and customary
transmittal materials, in  such  form and containing such provisions as
Parent and the Company shall mutually  agree (collectively, the " _Form  of
Election_ ").  The  Form of Election shall permit each Person who, at or
prior to the Election  Deadline (as defined below), is a record holder (or,
in the case of nominee  record holders, the beneficial owner, through proper
instructions and  documentation) of any share of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded  Shares)  to specify (i) the number of such holder's shares of
Company Common Stock with  respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election
and/or (ii) the number  of  such holder's shares of Company Common Stock
with respect to which such holder  makes a Stock Election. The Form of
Election shall specify that delivery  shall  be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only  upon proper delivery of the
completed Form of Election and any Certificates  to  the Exchange Agent. The
Company shall mail the Form of Election with the  Proxy 
Statement/Prospectus to all Persons who are record holders of shares of
Company  Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Shareholders'
Meeting and  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Form of
Election available  to all Persons who become holders of shares of Company
Common Stock during  the  period between the record date for the Company
Shareholders' Meeting and the  Election Deadline. As used in this Agreement,
" _Election  Deadline_ "  means  5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
date that is two (2) Business Days  immediately preceding the Closing Date
(or on such other date as the parties  hereto mutually agree).

 

 

(c) Any  such  election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have  received at its designated office, by the Election
Deadline, a Form of Election  properly completed and signed and accompanied
by Certificates representing  the  shares of Company Common Stock to which
such Form of Election relates (or  by an  appropriate guarantee of delivery
of such Certificates as set forth in such  Form  of Election from a firm
that is an "eligible guarantor institution" (as defined  in Rule 17Ad-15
under the Exchange Act); _provided,_   that  such Certificates are in fact
delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time  set  forth in such guarantee of
delivery). Any share of Company Common Stock (other  than Excluded Shares)
with respect to which a proper Cash Election or Stock  Election has not been
made as aforesaid shall be deemed to be a Non-Electing  Company Share. After
a Cash Election or a Stock Election is properly made  with  respect to any
share of Company Common Stock, no further registration of  transfers of such
share shall be made on the stock transfer books of the  Company, unless and
until such Cash Election or Stock Election is properly  revoked.

 

 

(d) Parent  and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated date of
the Election  Deadline at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing  Date.  If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent
date, the Election Deadline  shall  be similarly delayed to a subsequent
date, and Parent and the Company shall  promptly announce any such delay and,
when determined, the rescheduled Election  Deadline.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Any  Cash  Election or Stock Election may be revoked with respect to all
or any portion  of  the shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (but
only in whole share  amounts) by the holder who submitted the applicable Form
of Election by such  holder submitting to the Exchange Agent a written notice
of such revocation  received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the
Election Deadline. In  addition, all Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall
automatically be revoked  if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Article VIII. If a Cash  Election or Stock Election is revoked with respect
to any shares of Company  Common Stock, the Certificates representing such
shares shall be promptly  returned to the holder that submitted the same to
the Exchange Agent, except  to  the extent (if any) a subsequent Cash
Election and/or Stock Election is properly  made with respect to any or all
of the shares of Company Common Stock  represented by such Certificate.

 

 

(f) The  good  faith determination of the Exchange Agent (or the joint
determination of  Parent  and the Company, in the event that the Exchange
Agent declines to make any  such  determination) shall be conclusive and
binding as to whether or not Cash  Elections and Stock Elections shall have
been properly made or revoked pursuant  to this Section 3.2 and as to when
Cash Elections, Stock Elections and  revocations were received by the
Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall  have  reasonable discretion to
disregard immaterial defects in the Forms of Election.  The Exchange Agent
(or Parent and the Company jointly, in the event that  the  Exchange Agent
declines to make the following computations) shall also make  all 
computations as to the proration contemplated by Section 3.3, and absent 
manifest error such computations shall be conclusive and binding on Parent, 
the  Company and all holders of Company Common Stock. The Exchange Agent
may,  with  the written agreement of Parent after Parent's reasonable
consultation with the  Company, make any rules that are consistent with this
Section 3.2 for the  implementation of the Cash Elections and Stock Elections
provided for in  this  Agreement and shall be necessary or desirable to
effect the Cash Elections  and  Stock Elections.

 

 

Section  3.3. _Proration_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary:

 

 

(a) _Cash  Conversion Number_.  With  respect to all shares of Company
Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares)  issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time:

 

 

(i) eighty  percent (80%) of  such  shares (such number of shares, the "
_Cash  Conversion Number_ ")  shall  be converted into the right to receive
an amount per share equal to the Cash  Consideration; and

 

 

(ii) the  remainder of such shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the  Parent  Stock Consideration per share.

 

 

(b) _If  Cash Election Number Equals or Exceeds the Cash Conversion 
Number_.  If the  aggregate number of Cash Electing Company Shares (such
number of shares,  the " _Cash  Election Number_ ")  equals  or exceeds
the Cash Conversion Number, then:

 

 

(i) all  Stock  Electing Company Shares and all Non-Electing Company Shares
shall be converted  into the right to receive the Parent Stock Consideration
per share;  and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) the  number of Cash Electing Company Shares of each shareholder of the
Company  that  shall be converted into the right to receive an amount per
share equal to  the  Cash Consideration shall be equal to the product
obtained by multiplying  (x) the  number of Cash Electing Company Shares of
such shareholder by (y) a fraction,  the numerator of which is the Cash
Conversion Number and the denominator  of  which is the Cash Election
Number, and the remaining number of such holder's  Cash Electing Company
Shares shall be converted into the right to receive  the  Parent Stock
Consideration per share.

 

 

(c) _If  Cash Election Number Is Less Than the Cash Conversion Number_.  If
the  Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number (such
difference  between the Cash Election Number and the Cash Conversion Number,
the " _Shortfall  Number_ "),  then:

 

 

(i) all  Cash  Electing Company Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount  per share equal to the Cash Consideration; and

 

 

(ii) the  Stock  Electing Company Shares and the Non-Electing Company Shares
shall be treated  in  the following manner:

 

 

(x) _if  the  Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the aggregate number
of Non-Electing  Company Shares_ ,  then  (A) all Stock Electing Company
Shares shall be converted into the right to  receive the Parent Stock
Consideration per share and (B) the number of  Non-Electing Company Shares of
each shareholder of the Company that shall  be  converted into the right to
receive an amount per share equal to the Cash  Consideration shall be equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the  number of Non-Electing
Company Shares of such shareholder by (2) a fraction,  the  numerator of
which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is  the 
aggregate number of Non-Electing Company Shares, and the remaining number 
of  such holder's Non-Electing Company Shares shall be converted into the
right to  receive the Parent Stock Consideration per share; or

 

 

(y) _if  the  Shortfall Number exceeds the aggregate number of Non-Electing
Company  Shares_ ,  then  (A) all Non-Electing Company Shares shall be
converted into the right to  receive  an amount per share equal to the Cash
Consideration and (B) the number of  Stock  Electing Company Shares of each
shareholder of the Company that shall be  converted into the right to receive
an amount per share equal to the Cash  Consideration shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the  number of Stock Electing Company
Shares of such shareholder by (2) a fraction,  the numerator of which is the
amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds  the  aggregate number of Non-
Electing Company Shares and the denominator of which  is  the aggregate
number of Stock Electing Company Shares, and the remaining  number  of such
holder's Stock Electing Company Shares shall be converted into the right  to
receive the Parent Stock Consideration per share.

Section 3.4.  _Delivery  of the Merger Consideration_.

 

 

(a) _Deposits  with Exchange Agent_.  Prior  to the Effective Time (and,
with respect to Parent Stock, from time to time  after the Effective Time as
applicable), Parent shall deposit with the Exchange  Agent, pursuant to an
agreement providing for the matters set forth in this  Section 3.4 and such
other matters as may be appropriate and the terms of  which shall be mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Company, an amount in  cash  and certificates
representing shares of Parent Stock sufficient to effect  the  conversion of
each share of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares)  into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedures_. 

 

 

(i) Promptly  after the Effective Time, but in any event not more than five
(5) Business  Days  after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to  each  holder of record as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time of Non-Electing  Company Shares (each such holder, a "
_Non-Electing  Company Holder_ "  ),  subject  to Section 3.3, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery  shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to each Certificate representing  any Non-Electing
Company Shares held by such Non-Electing Company Holder  shall  pass, only
upon delivery of the completed letter of transmittal and such  Certificate to
the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such  other 
provisions as Parent and the Company shall mutually agree) and (ii)
instructions  for use in effecting the surrender of each such Certificate in
exchange for  the  total amount of Merger Consideration that such Non-
Electing Company Holder  is  entitled to receive in exchange for such
holder's Non-Electing Company Shares in  the Merger pursuant to this
Agreement. From and after the Effective Time,  until  surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.4, each Certificate  representing Non-Electing
Company Shares held by a Non-Electing Company Holder  shall be deemed to
represent only the right to receive the total amount of  Merger Consideration
to which such Non-Electing Company Holder is entitled  in  exchange for such
Non-Electing Company Shares as contemplated by this Article  III.

 

 

(ii) Upon  surrender by a Non-Electing Company Holder to the Exchange Agent
of all  Certificates representing such holder's Non-Electing Company Shares,
together  with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance  with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required  pursuant to such instructions, each Non-Electing Company Holder
shall be  entitled to receive in exchange therefor (and  the  Exchange
Agent shall mail to such Non-Electing Holder within ten (10) Business  Days
following such surrender):  (A) a  certificate (or certificates in the
aggregate) representing the number of  whole  shares of Parent Stock, if
any, into which such holder's shares of Company  Common Stock represented by
such holder's properly surrendered Certificates were  converted in accordance
with this Article III, and such Certificates so  surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled, and (B) a check in an amount of  U.S.  dollars (after
giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section  3.4(g)) equal
to (I) the amount of cash (consisting of the Cash Consideration  and cash in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant  to  Section
3.1(d)), if any, into which such holder's shares of Company Common Stock 
represented by such holder's properly surrendered Certificates were converted
in  accordance with this Article III, plus (II) any cash dividends and
other  distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section  3.4(c).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) As  of the  Effective Time, each former shareholder of the Company who
properly made  and did  not revoke a Cash Election and/or a Stock Election
shall be entitled to receive  in exchange for such shareholder's Electing
Company Shares (and the Exchange  Agent shall mail to such former shareholder
within ten (10) Business Days  following the Effective Time, unless such
former shareholder is also a  Non-Electing Company Holder, in which case the
Exchange Agent shall include  in  its mailing to such former shareholder
pursuant to Section 3.4(b)(ii)): (A)  a  certificate (or certificates in the
aggregate) representing the number of  whole  shares of Parent Stock, if
any, into which such holder's shares of Company  Common Stock represented by
such holder's properly surrendered Certificates were  converted in accordance
with this Article III, and such Certificates so  surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled, and (B) a check in an amount of  U.S.  dollars (after
giving effect to any required withholdings pursuant to Section  3.4(g)) equal
to (I) the amount of cash (consisting of the Cash Consideration  and cash in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock to be paid pursuant  to  Section
3.1(d)), if any, into which such holder's shares of Company Common Stock 
represented by such holder's properly surrendered Certificates were converted
in  accordance with this Article III, plus (II) any cash dividends and
other  distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section  3.4(c).

 

 

(c) _Dividends  and Distributions_.  No  dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Stock shall  be  paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate  is  surrendered as
provided in this Article III. Subject to the effect of applicable  Laws,
following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to  the 
record holder of the shares of Parent Stock issued in exchange for shares 
of  Company Common Stock represented immediately prior to the Effective
Time  by such  Certificate (i) when any payment or distribution of a
certificate representing  any share(s) of Parent Stock is made to such holder
pursuant to Section  3.4(b)(ii) or (iii), all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect  of  such Parent Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment  date  on or prior to the date of
such surrender and not previously paid and (ii)  on  the appropriate payment
date, the dividends or other distributions payable  with  respect to such
Parent Stock with a record date after the Effective Time  but  prior to
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender.  For 
purposes of dividends and other distributions in respect of Parent Stock, 
all  shares of Parent Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
entitled  to  dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if
issued and  outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

 

(d) _Transfer  Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_.  After  the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed 
and  there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company  Common  Stock on the records of the Company. After the Effective
Time, the holders of  Certificates shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares,  except  the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and such dividends and other  distributions on or in respect of
Parent Stock as provided herein or as  otherwise provided by applicable Law.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates  are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be  canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article III.

 

 

(e) _Termination  of Fund; No Liability_.  At any  time following twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall  be  entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent  (i) certificates representing shares
of Parent Stock and (ii) cash held by  the Exchange Agent for payment of Cash
Consideration and cash payments in  lieu  of fractional shares of Parent
Stock, in each case, not delivered to holders  of  Certificates. Thereafter,
holders of Certificates shall be entitled to look  only  to Parent, which
shall thereafter act as the Exchange Agent (subject to  abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors  of  Parent with
respect to the delivery of the Merger Consideration (including  payment of
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock). None  of  Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be liable  to any  Person
for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant  to 
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.  In the  event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon  the  making of
an affidavit attesting to that fact by the Person claiming such  Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by Parent or  the 
Surviving Corporation, the delivery by such Person of a bond (in such amount 
as  Parent or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct) as indemnity
against  any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving  Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction
of such  Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen  or  destroyed Certificate a certificate representing shares of
Parent Stock and/or  deliver a check for Cash Consideration, and pay the cash
in lieu of any  fractional share of Parent Stock to which such holder is
entitled, which  constitute the total amount of Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect  of  such Certificate as determined in accordance
with this Article III.

 

 

(g) _Withholding  Taxes_.  The  right of any Person to receive payment or
consideration payable upon surrender  of a Certificate pursuant to the Merger

ARTICLE  V

 

REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES

 

OF  PARENT  AND MERGER SUB

 

 

Except  (i) as reasonably apparent from disclosure in the Parent SEC
Documents filed  on  or prior to the date hereof or (ii) as set forth in a
separate disclosure  schedule (the " _Parent  Disclosure Schedule_ ") 
which  has been delivered by the Parent and Merger Sub to the Company at or
prior  to  the execution of this Agreement (each section of which qualifies
the  correspondingly numbered representation and warranty, or covenant, to
the  extent  specified therein and such other representations, warranties
and covenants  to  the extent a matter in such section is disclosed in such
a way as to make  its  relevance to the information called for by such other
representation and  warranty, or covenant, reasonably apparent on its face),
Merger Sub and the  Parent hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant
to the Company  as  follows:

 

 

Section 5.1.  _Corporate  Organization_.

 

 

(a) Each  of  Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Material Subsidiaries is a
corporation,  partnership or limited liability company duly incorporated or
organized,  validly  existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its  incorporation or organization and has the requisite
power, corporate or  otherwise, and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets  and to  carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Each of Parent, Merger  Sub  and the Parent Material Subsidiaries
is duly licensed or qualified to do  business in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted  by  it or the character or location of
the properties and assets owned or leased  by  it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary except where the failure  to  be so licensed or
qualified would not be reasonably expected to have, when  aggregated with all
other such failures, a Parent Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(b) The  copies of the Parent Certificate and Parent By-laws most recently
filed with  the  Parent SEC Documents are true, complete and correct copies
of such documents,  and the copies of the Articles of Incorporation and By-
laws of Merger Sub  delivered to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement are true, complete  and correct copies of such documents, in each
case as in effect as of the  date  of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 5.2.  _Capitalization_.

Parent  Stock and 10,000,000 shares have been designated as shares of
preferred stock,  par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent  Preferred
Stock_ ").  At  the close of business on June 29, 2007, (i) 26,130,618
shares of Parent Stock  were issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Parent

for  any purpose), and (v) no other class or series of shares of capital
stock  of  Parent had been designated, issued or reserved for issuance. All
of the issued  and outstanding shares of Parent Stock have been duly
authorized and validly  issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
any preemptive rights.  Except as provided in this Agreement and except as
set forth in clause (iii)  of  the second sentence of this Section 5.2(a),
there are no outstanding  subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights,
arrangements, undertakings,  commitments or agreements of any character
calling for the purchase, issuance,  redemption or repurchase of any
securities of Parent to which Parent or any  Parent Subsidiary is a party,
including any securities representing the right  to  purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of Parent Stock. The shares of Parent  Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger, when issued in accordance with  the  terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, will be duly authorized, 
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of any preemptive
rights,  and will not be subject to any restrictions on the resale thereof
under federal  or state securities Laws.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 100 shares of
Merger Sub  Common Stock, all of which shares are issued and outstanding and
are owned,  of  record and beneficially, solely by Parent.

 

 

(c) Parent  owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of  the  capital stock or partnership or member interests of each
Parent Material  Subsidiary, free and clear of any Liens, except for (i)
Liens imposed under  federal or state securities Laws, (ii) Liens
specifically disclosed in the  Parent SEC Financial Statements and (iii)
Liens that would not be reasonably  expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse  Effect. All such shares of capital
stock are duly authorized and validly  issued  and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of any preemptive rights. Neither  Parent nor any of
the Parent Material Subsidiaries has any outstanding  subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any  character calling for the
purchase or issuance of any security of any of  the  Parent Material
Subsidiaries, including any securities representing the right  to  purchase
or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock of any of the Parent 
Material Subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on Parent with respect to 
voting the stock of any Parent Material Subsidiary.

 

 

(d) With  respect to each corporation, limited liability company, partnership
or other  entity in which Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries has a
direct or  indirect ownership interest in which it invested and/or to which
is loaned  more  than $20,000,000 and which is not a Parent Material
Subsidiary, Parent owns  such  ownership interest free and clear of any
Liens, except for (i) Liens imposed  under the applicable partnership or
similar governing agreement or under  federal  or state securities Laws,
(ii) Liens specifically disclosed in the Parent  SEC  Financial Statements
and (iii) Liens that would not be reasonably expected  to  have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse  Effect.

 

 

Section 5.3.  _Authority_.  Each of  Parent and Merger Sub has all
necessary corporate power and authority to  execute  and deliver this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions to be consummated  by it. The
execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of  this 
Agreement, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions 
to  be consummated by them, have been duly authorized and approved by the
respective  Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub, and by Parent as
the sole  shareholder of Merger Sub, and no other corporate action on the
part of Parent  or its stockholders, or Merger Sub or its shareholders, is
necessary to  authorize the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub
of this Agreement  and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions to be  consummated by them, including the Parent Stock Issuance.
This Agreement  has  been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger
Sub, and, assuming  due and  valid authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company,  constitutes the valid and binding obligation
of each of Parent and Merger  Sub,  enforceable against each of them in
accordance with its terms, except that  such  enforceability (i) may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or  other  similar Laws
affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors' rights  generally and
(ii) is subject to general principles of equity.

5.4(a)_   of the  Parent Disclosure Schedule, (ii) the filing with the SEC

of State of  the Articles of Merger and related docketing statements, (iv)
such filings  and  approvals as may be required to be made or obtained under
the state blue  sky or  securities Laws of various states in connection with
the issuance of shares  of  Parent Stock pursuant to this Agreement, (v)

issued pursuant to this Agreement  to be  approved for listing on NASDAQ,

may be required under, and other  applicable requirements of, the Exchange
Act, the Exchange Act Rules or the  HSR  Act, (vii) filings with, and the
approval required by, the FCC under the  Communications Act or the FCC Rules
and (viii) filings with, and the approval  required by, the PPUC under the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Code or the PPUC  Rules (all of the foregoing,
collectively, the " _Parent  Required Statutory Approvals_ "),  no  consent
or approval of, or filing, declaration or registration with, any 
Governmental Entity, which has not been received or made, is required to 
be  obtained by or made by Parent or Merger Sub for the consummation by
Parent  and  Merger Sub of the Transactions to be consummated by them, other
than such  consents, approvals, filings, declarations or registrations that,
if not  obtained or made, would not be reasonably expected to have,
individually  or in  the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(b) None  of  the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement and  the  consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions to be consummated  by  them, and compliance by Parent and
Merger Sub with any of the terms and  provisions of this Agreement, will (i)
violate any provision of the Parent  Certificate or Parent By-laws, the
Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of  Merger Sub, or the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws (or any similar  organizational documents with a
different name) of any other Parent Material  Subsidiary or (ii) assuming
that the Parent Required Statutory Approvals  are  obtained or made, as the
case may be, prior to the Effective Time, (x) violate  any Law applicable to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary or  any  of their
respective properties or assets, or the award of any arbitrator  or  panel
of arbitrators applicable to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent

result in the loss of any material benefit under, constitute a default (or 
an  event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default)  under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation  under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation  of any  Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of
Parent, Merger Sub  or  any other Parent Subsidiary under any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed  of  trust, license, permit, lease, contract,
agreement or other instrument to  which  Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Parent Subsidiary is a party, or by which  any of  them or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound or affected,  except, in the
case of clause (ii) above, for such violations, losses of  benefits,
defaults, events, terminations, rights of termination or cancellation, 
accelerations or Lien creations as would not be reasonably expected to have, 
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Parent  is  qualified under applicable Laws to be a transferee of the
Licenses issued  by the  FCC and PPUC. To Parent's Knowledge, there is (i)
no reason why the FCC or the  PPUC will not grant their consent to the
transfer of control to Parent of  the  Licenses issued by the FCC and the
PPUC, respectively, and (ii) no fact that  would reasonably be expected to
lead to a condition of the consent of the  FCC or  the PPUC that would not
allow Parent to consummate the Transactions. Parent  does  not have ten
percent (10%) or greater foreign owners, including both equity  and  voting
shares, and Parent is not controlled by foreigners such that the consent  of
the FCC will include Team Telecom review.

 

 

Section 5.5.  _SEC  Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed
Liabilities_.

 

 

(a) Parent  has filed all reports, schedules, forms and registration
statements with  the SEC  required to be filed by it pursuant to the
Securities Act and the Securities  Act  Rules, or the Exchange Act and the
Exchange Act Rules, in each such case  since  January 1, 2005 (collectively,
and in each case including all annexes and  schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, the " _Parent  SEC Documents_ ").  As
of  their respective dates (or if subsequently amended or superseded by a
filing  prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such filing), the
Parent  SEC  Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the
requirements  of  the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules  and  regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable to such Parent SEC  Documents, and none of the Parent SEC
Documents as of such dates contained  any  untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required  to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein,  in  light of the

Oxley Act. The management of Parent has completed its assessment  of the 
effectiveness of Parent's internal control over financial reporting in 
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
for the year ended December 31, 2006, and such assessment concluded that 
such controls were effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of Parent's financial reporting and the preparation of Parent's 
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent 
has  disclosed, based on its assessment of the effectiveness of Parent's
internal  control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of  Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31,  2006, to Parent's independent registered accounting firm and
the audit committee  of the Board of Directors of Parent (A) any significant
deficiencies and  material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over  financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parent's  ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and  (B) any fraud, whether or not material, of which there is
Parent's  Knowledge that involves management or other employees who have a
significant  role in Parent's internal control over financial reporting for
the year ended  December 31, 2006. Parent any has made available to the
Company a summary  of any  such disclosures made by management to such
accounting firm or audit committee  for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Person or any business  or  division thereof, unless such acquisition or
agreement would not (i) impose  any  delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining,  any  authorizations,
consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental  Entity
necessary to consummate the Merger or any of the other Transactions  or  the
expiration or termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act or  other 
Law, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order 
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions 
or  (iii) increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal  or  otherwise;

 

 

(d) adopt  any  amendments to the Parent Certificate or Parent By-laws (or
the comparable  governing documents of any of the Parent Subsidiaries) which
would alter  any of  the terms of Parent Stock; or

 

 

(e) authorize,  recommend, propose or announce an intention to do any of the
foregoing, or  enter  into any contract, agreement, commitment or
arrangement to take any of the  actions prohibited by this Section 6.2.

 

 

Section 6.3.  _No  Solicitation_.

 

 

(a) During  the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until the  earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance  with Section 8.1, the Company agrees that the Company and the
Company  Subsidiaries shall not, and neither the Company nor any of the
Company  Subsidiaries shall authorize any of their respective officers,
directors,  employees, agents, advisors and other representatives (including
any investment  banker, financial advisor, attorney or accountant retained by
the Company  or any  of the Company Subsidiaries or any of the foregoing)
(collectively, the " _Company  Representatives_ ")  to,  initiate or
solicit (including by way of furnishing non-public information)  or 
knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, 
or is  reasonably expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal from any
Person or  group  of Persons or engage in any substantive discussions or
negotiations concerning,  or provide any non-public information with respect
to, an Alternative Proposal. 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
(directly or through  its  Company Representatives) may:

 

 

(i) until  receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, engage in substantive
discussions  or negotiations with a Person or group of Persons that makes a
bona fide  Alternative Proposal (under circumstances in which the Company has
complied  in  all material respects with its non-solicitation obligations
under Section  6.3(a)) and may furnish to such Person(s) and its/their
representatives  information concerning, and may afford such Person(s) and
its/their  representatives access to, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their  businesses, properties, assets, books and records, if
(x) in the good faith  judgment of the Company's Board of Directors (after
consultation with the  Company's financial advisor and outside counsel), such
Alternative Proposal  constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, and  (y)  prior to furnishing such information or access
to, or entering into substantive  discussions (except as to the existence of
this Section 6.3) or negotiations  with, such Person(s), (A) the Company
receives from such Person(s) an executed  Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (B) the Company notifies Parent  to the  effect that it
intends to furnish information or access to, or intends to  enter  into
substantive discussions or negotiations with, such Person(s);

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) comply  with Rules 14e-2 and 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
with regard  to a  tender or exchange offer;

 

 

(iii) make  "stop-look-and-listen" communications with respect to an
Alternative Proposal of  the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 of the
Exchange Act Rules;  and

 

 

(iv) make  such  other disclosures to the Company's shareholders, and take
such other actions, as  are required by Law.

 



 

In  addition to the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
set  forth in clause (i) of this Section 6.3(b), the Company shall promptly
notify  Parent in writing of any Alternative Proposal made after the date of
this  Agreement, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions
of  any  such Alternative Proposal and the identity of the Person(s) making
such  Alternative Proposal. The Company agrees that it and the Company
Subsidiaries  will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
Person subsequent  to  the date hereof which prohibits the Company from
providing such information  to  Parent. The Company shall promptly make
available to Parent and Merger Sub  any  material non-public information
concerning the Company or the Company  Subsidiaries that is made available to
such Person(s) which was not previously  made available to Parent and Merger
Sub.

 

 

(c) The  Board  of Directors of the Company may not (i) withdraw or modify,
in a manner  adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation by the Board
of Directors  of  the Company of the Merger or this Agreement (except as set
forth in clause  (y)  of the proviso to Section 2.6(b)(i) or as set forth
below in this Section  6.3(c)), (ii) approve or recommend an Alternative
Proposal or (iii) cause  the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of  intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement  related to any Alternative Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality  Agreement). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of  the  Company Shareholder
Approval, if the Board of Directors of the Company (after  consultation with
the Company's financial advisor and outside counsel)  determines in good
faith that any Alternative Proposal referred to in Section  6.3(b)
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company  may:

 

 

(w) withdraw  or modify its approval or recommendation of the Merger and this
Agreement; 

 

 

(x) approve  or recommend such Superior Proposal;

 

 

(y) cause  the  Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into a
binding written  agreement with respect to such Alternative Proposal (a "
_Superior  Proposal Agreement_ ")  (and  amend the Rights Agreement in
connection therewith); and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(z) terminate  this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(c); _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  (A) prior to terminating this Agreement, the Company
shall give Parent at  least  four (4) Business Days' notice thereof (except
as provided in the final sentence  of this clause (z)), attaching the
Superior Proposal Agreement (or, if  applicable, the most current draft
thereof), which notice need only be given  once with respect to any Superior
Proposal, unless such Superior Proposal is  modified in any material respect,
and (B) if, within such four (4) Business  Day  period (except as provided
in the final sentence of this clause (z)), Parent  makes an offer that the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good  faith is more favorable
to the shareholders of the Company (other than Parent,  Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates), from a financial point of view,  than such Superior
Proposal (taking into account, among other things, (I)  the  terms of such
offer and (II) such legal, financial, regulatory, timing and  other  aspects
of such offer which the Company's Board of Directors deems relevant),  and
agrees in writing to all adjustments in the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement as are necessary to reflect such offer, the Company's notice of 
termination with respect to such Superior Proposal shall be deemed to be 
rescinded and of no further force and effect and, if the Company or any
Company  Subsidiary has entered into a Superior Proposal Agreement, it shall
promptly  terminate such agreement (it being agreed that the Company will
cause any  Superior Proposal Agreement entered into prior to the expiration
of such  four  (4) Business Day period to include a provision permitting
such termination).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Company gives Parent  at  least four (4) Business Days' notice of a Superior
Proposal as provided above in  this clause (z), then any subsequent notice of
termination given by the Company  under this clause (z) shall require only at
least two (2) Business Days' notice  before taking effect and, accordingly,
all references above in this clause  (z)  to four (4) Business Days shall
instead be deemed to be two (2) Business  Days.

 

 

Section 6.4.  _Publicity_.  The  initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall  be a  joint press release reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company. Thereafter,  so long as this Agreement
is in effect, none of the Company, Parent and any  of  their respective
Affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press  release or
other announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement  or any  of
the other Transactions without the prior written approval of the Company 
and  Parent, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement
with  a  securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party  wanting to make such release or announcement.

 

 

Section 6.5.  _Access  to Information_.

 

 

(a) Upon  reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange  of  information, each of Parent and the Company (each a "
_Disclosing  Party_ ")  shall,  and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford
to the other Disclosing Party's  officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other representatives, during  normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, reasonable  access to all its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records,  and to  its officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives and,  during such period, each
Disclosing Party shall, and shall cause its  Subsidiaries to, make available
to the other Disclosing Party and the other  Disclosing Party's appropriate
representatives (i) a copy of each report,  schedule, registration statement
and other document filed or received by  it  during such period pursuant to
the requirements of federal securities Laws  (other than reports or documents
which the Disclosing Party is not permitted  to  so disclose under
applicable Law) and (ii) all other information concerning  its business,
properties and personnel as such other Disclosing Party may  reasonably
request. Neither Disclosing Party nor any of its Subsidiaries  shall  be
required to provide access to or to disclose information if such access  or 
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, suppliers 
or  employees, jeopardize the work product privilege or the attorney-client 
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information, 
or  contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into
prior  to  the date of this Agreement, _provided_   that the  applicable
Disclosing Party gives notice to the other Disclosing Party of  the  same.
The parties hereto will use commercially reasonable efforts to the  extent 
practicable to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under 
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence  apply.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) None  of  the Company, Parent or Merger Sub makes any representation as
to the accuracy  of  any information provided pursuant to Section 6.5(a),
and no party hereto  may rely on the accuracy of any such information, other
than as expressly  set  forth in the Company's representations and
warranties in Article IV or Parent's  and Merger Sub's representations and
warranties in Article V, as the case may  be.

 

 

(c) The  information provided pursuant to Section 6.5(a) will be used solely
for the  purpose of effecting the Transactions and will be governed by the
terms of  the  Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

Section 6.6.  _Further  Assurances; Regulatory Matters; Shareholder
Litigation_.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Merger Sub  and  the Company shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
cooperate with each  other and use (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use)
commercially reasonable  efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary, proper  or  advisable to comply promptly with all legal
requirements which may be imposed  on  such party with respect to the Merger
or the other Transactions and, subject  to  the conditions set forth in
Article VII, to consummate the Transactions as  promptly as practicable and
(ii) promptly to prepare and file all necessary  documentation, to effect all
necessary applications, notices, petitions,  filings  and other documents,
and to use commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain  as  soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement all necessary permits, 
consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Entities
necessary  or  advisable in connection with consummating the Transactions,
including the  Company Required Statutory Approvals and Parent Required
Statutory Approvals.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
provisions of this  Section 6.6(a), each party hereto and/or its Subsidiaries
shall, within  fifteen (15) Business Days (and, with respect to the PPUC, ten
(10) Business  Days) after the execution of this Agreement, file to the
extent necessary  any  initial documentation required to obtain all
requisite approvals or termination  of applicable waiting periods for the
Merger and the other Transactions under  the HSR Act, the Pennsylvania Public
Utility Code, the PPUC Rules, the  Communications Act, and the FCC Rules. In
connection with the foregoing,  Parent  and the Company agree that the
Company shall have primary responsibility  for the  preparation and filing
of all applications, filings or other materials with  the  FCC and the PPUC
and any other Federal or state regulatory agency or commission,  in each case
with respect to the Merger and the Transactions (with discrete 
responsibilities with respect to the preparation of such filings to be
agreed  upon by the Company and Parent); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
Parent and its counsel, and the Company and its counsel, shall each be given 
a  reasonably opportunity to review and comment upon drafts of all such 
applications, filings and other materials, including testimony and responses 
to  discovery requests, or portions thereof prepared by the other party,
and  shall  provide any comments thereon to the other party as soon as
practicable (but  in  no event later than three (3) Business Days after
being asked to comment  thereon).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) In  furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
hereto  contained in Section 6.6(a), each of the parties hereto shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may 
be  asserted with respect to any of the Transactions by or under the FCC,
the  FCC  Rules, the PPUC, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Code, the PPUC
Rules, the  HSR  Act, the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of
Justice, including  using  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
clearance, or if such clearance  cannot  be obtained, to reach an agreement,
settlement, consent providing for  divestiture, a "hold separate" agreement,
contractual undertakings with third  Persons or any other relief, with the
Governmental Entity investigating the  Merger or the other Transactions;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the foregoing shall not require any party
hereto to agree to any asset  divestiture or restriction on its or any of its
Subsidiaries' business  operations  or any  other condition imposed to a
Company Required Statutory Approval or a Parent  Required Statutory Approval
that  would  be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business,  results of operations, financial condition or assets and
liabilities, taken  as a  whole, of either party and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. In connection  with the foregoing, if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding,  including any proceeding by a private Person,
is instituted (or threatened  to be  instituted) challenging any of the
Transactions as violative of the HSR Act  or  any other antitrust Law or
other Law in any jurisdiction, the parties hereto  shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and use their respective  commercially reasonable
efforts to contest and resist any such action or  proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment  or  other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect  and  that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of any of the Transactions, 
including defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in 
any  such action or proceeding by any Person.

 

 

Section 6.7.  _Company  Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(a) Parent  shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to,  honor  in accordance with their terms all the Company
Benefit Plans and Company  Union  Contracts.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, for at least one (1)
year following the  Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its  Subsidiaries to, provide employees of the Surviving
Corporation and it  Subsidiaries with compensation and employee benefits
which, in the aggregate,  are no less favorable to such employees than the
compensation and employee  benefits in  effect  for such employees of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries immediately  prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  this Section 6.7(b) shall
not apply to any negotiated labor agreements, which  the Surviving
Corporation shall honor according to their terms; and _provided_ ,  _further_
,  that no  further benefits shall be required to be accrued under the North
Pittsburgh  Telephone Company Retirement Income Restoration Plan on or after
April 1,  2008.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Parent  shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to,  (i)  credit all service with the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries  (including service recognized by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries  for service with other entities) for purposes of
determining vesting and  eligibility, and for purposes of determining the
level of benefits with respect  to vacation, paid time off and severance,
under any employee benefit plan,  policy or program maintained by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any  of  their respective Subsidiaries that
cover employees or former employees of  the  Company after the Closing, (ii)
waive any pre-existing condition or  limitation or exclusion with respect to
employees of the Company or any of  the  Company Subsidiaries under any
group health plan or other welfare benefit  plan  to the extent they were
waived or would be waived under the Company Benefit  Plans, and (iii)
recognize the dollar amount of all expenses incurred by  employees of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and their dependents  in the plan
year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of deductibles,  co-payments
and maximum out-of pocket limits under any group health  plan.

 

 

(d) Without  limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation  and its Subsidiaries to, pay severance benefits to
persons who were salaried  employees of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries prior to the  Effective Time and whose employment with the
Company, the Surviving Corporation  or any of their respective Subsidiaries
is terminated within two (2) years  following the Closing, in accordance with
the terms of the North Pittsburgh  Systems, Inc. Severance Plan as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective  Time.

 

 

Section 6.8.  _Indemnification  and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) From  and  after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly  and severally (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to), indemnify,  defend and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted under  the PBCL or other applicable
Law, each Person who is now, or has been at  any  time prior to the date of
this Agreement or who becomes such prior to the  Effective Time, an officer,
director or employee of the Company or any of  the  Company Subsidiaries
(individually, an " _Indemnified  Party_ ," and  collectively, the "
_Indemnified  Parties_ ")  (in  such Person's capacity as such and not as
shareholders of the Company) against  any and all losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees  and disbursements), fines,
liabilities and judgments and amounts that are  paid  in settlement with the
approval of the indemnifying party (which approval  shall  not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (collectively, "
_Indemnified  Liabilities_ ")  incurred  in connection with any pending,
threatened or completed claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or investigative (each,  a " _Proceeding_ ") 
based  in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining  in  whole or in part to (i) the fact that such Person is or was
an officer,  director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of
the Company  Subsidiaries or (ii) matters occurring or existing at or prior
to the Effective  Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection
with this Agreement  or  any of the Transactions), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after,  the  Effective Time. In the event any claim
for Indemnified Liabilities is asserted  or made by an Indemnified Party, any
determination required to be made with  respect to whether such Indemnified
Party's conduct complies with the standards  set forth under the PBCL or
other applicable Law shall be made by independent  legal counsel selected by
such Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable  to  the Surviving
Corporation. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to,
promptly advance all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of  each  Indemnified
Party in connection with any Proceeding as such expenses (including 
attorneys' fees and disbursements) are incurred upon receipt from such 
Indemnified Party of a request therefor (accompanied by invoices or other 
relevant documentation), _provided_   (if and  to the extent required by the
PBCL or other applicable Law) that such  Indemnified Party undertakes to
repay such amount if it is ultimately determined  that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to be indemnified under the PBCL  or  other applicable Law
with respect to such Proceeding. In the event that any  Proceeding is brought
against any Indemnified Party (and in connection with  which indemnification
could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder),  Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall each use commercially reasonable  efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of such matter; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise
or  consent  to the entry of any judgment in any such Proceeding without 
the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party if  and to  the extent
the terms of the proposed settlement, compromise or judgment involve  any
non-monetary relief from such Indemnified Party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) All  rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in
favor of,  and  all exculpations and limitations of the personal liability
of, the directors,  officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents of any of the
Company and the  Company Subsidiaries in the Company Articles or Company By-
laws (or comparable  organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries) as
in effect as of  the  Effective Time with respect to matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective  Time, including the Merger and the other
Transactions, shall continue in  full  force and effect for a period of not
less than six (6) years from the Effective  Time; _provided_ ,  _however_
,  that  all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims asserted or
made within  such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
claim. The  Surviving Corporation shall not, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving  Corporation not to, distribute or dispose of assets in a manner
that would  render the Surviving Corporation or any successor unable to
satisfy any of  its  obligations pursuant to this Section 6.8.

 

 

(c) For  a  period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation  shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, maintain in effect
the current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained
by any of the Company and  the Company Subsidiaries for the benefit of those
Persons who are covered  by  such policies at the date of this Agreement or
the Effective Time with respect  to claims arising in whole or in part from
matters occurring or allegedly  occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(provided that the Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries may substitute
therefor policies of at least  the same coverage containing terms and
conditions that are at least as  beneficial to the beneficiaries of the
current policies and with reputable  carriers having a rating comparable to
the Company's current carrier);  _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  each of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall,  and 
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, first 
use  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a "tail" policy on
substantially the  same terms and conditions for claims arising out of acts
or conduct occurring  on  or prior to the Effective Time and effective for
claims asserted during the  full  six (6)-year period referred to above
(and, with respect to claims made during  such period, until final resolution
thereof), and only if Parent and the  Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries are unable, after exerting their  commercially reasonable
efforts, to obtain such a "tail" policy, then Parent or  the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be required to obtain  such  coverage
from such carriers in annual policies; _provided_ ,  _further,_   that (i) 
if the existing policies expire or are terminated or canceled during such 
six  (6)-year period, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its 
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and 
its  Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
substantially  similar policies with reputable carriers having a rating
comparable to the  Company's current carrier, (ii) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and its  Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall not be required
to spend as an annual  premium therefor an amount in excess of $650,000 and
(iii) if, during such  six  (6)-year period, such insurance coverage cannot
be obtained at all or can  be  obtained only for an amount in excess of
$650,000, Parent or the Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to cause to be
obtained as much directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage as can
be obtained for $650,000, on terms and  conditions substantially similar to
the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time the Company
shall be permitted  to  purchase prepaid "tail" policies in favor of the
individuals referred to in  Section 6.8(c) with respect to the matters
described therein (provided that  the  annual premium therefor shall not
exceed $650,000). If and to the extent  such  policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and  shall  cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such policies in effect and  continue to honor the
obligations of the Company thereunder.

 

 

(e) Parent  shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
perform in  accordance with their terms all indemnification agreements in
effect as of  the  date of this Agreement between the Company, on the one
hand, and any director  or  officer of the Company, on the other hand.

 

 

(f) The  provisions of this Section 6.8: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of,  and  shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his  or her  personal representatives, (ii) shall be binding
on Parent and the Surviving  Corporation and their respective successors and
assigns and (iii) are in  addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification  or  contribution that any such Person may have,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract,  any Company Benefit Plan, the  Company
Articles or Company By-Laws (or  comparable organizational documents of the
Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving  Corporation),  or  otherwise.

 

 

(g) In  the  event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person  and  shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such  consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its  properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper  provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the  Surviving Corporation, as the case may be (and such
Person's ultimate parent  entity, if applicable), assume the obligations of
Parent or the Surviving  Corporation, as the case may be, set forth in this
Section 6.8.

 

 

Section 6.9.  _NASDAQ  Approval_.  Parent  shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Stock  to  be issued
pursuant to the Merger to be approved for listing on NASDAQ upon  official
notice of issuance.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 6.10.  _SEC  Filings_.  During  the period from the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective  Time  or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, each  of the  Company and Parent
shall file in a timely manner all reports, schedules,  forms  and
registration statements with the SEC required to be filed by it pursuant 
to  the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of
the  SEC  promulgated thereunder, which filings (including all financial
statements  included therein) at the time of such filing shall not contain
any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to  be  stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light  of  the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

 

Section 6.11.  _Certain  Obligations of Merger Sub_.  Prior  to the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement  in 
accordance with Section 8.1:

 

 

(a) Merger  Sub shall not, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to,
undertake any business  or activities other than in connection with this
Agreement and engaging in  the  Merger and the other Transactions.

 

 

(b) Parent  shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform
its obligations  under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the
other Transactions  on  the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

 

 

ARTICLE  VII

 

CONDITIONS

 

 

Section 7.1.  _Conditions  to Each Party 's Obligations to Effect the
Merger_.  The  obligation of each party to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the  satisfaction at or prior to the Closing of each of the
following conditions  (which may be waived in whole or in part by such
party):

 

 

(a) _Company  Shareholder Approval_.  The  Company Shareholder Approval
