Controlled Entity that is a party thereto have delivered or received a written
notice of termination thereunder. Neither SELLER nor any Controlled Entity
that is a party to a given Lease has received written notice of a default by
such Person which with notice or lapse of time or both (i) would constitute a
default that would give rise to an automatic termination or the right of
discretionary termination of the Lease or (ii) would cause acceleration of any

ARISING OUT OF, RESULTING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY PERSONAL INJURY TO OR
PROPERTY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF BUYER, BUYER'S AFFILIATES,
REPRESENTATIVES OR ANY PERSON ACTING ON BUYER'S OR ITS AFFILIATES' BEHALF
(COLLECTIVELY WITH BUYER, "BUYER REPRESENTATIVES") IN CONNECTION WITH ANY

7.3 Effect of Casualty Loss. SELLER will promptly notify BUYER of any Casualty
Loss of which SELLER becomes aware prior to the Closing. If a Casualty Loss
occurs and SELLER's good faith estimated cost to repair or replace the
destroyed or damaged Asset does not exceed $10,000,000, SELLER may elect, by
issuing notice to BUYER within 10 days after making the determination to
repair or replace the destroyed or damaged Asset, to proceed with repairing or
replacing such damaged or destroyed Asset. Upon issuing said notice, the
Closing will be extended for up to 90 days during which time SELLER will at
its sole cost and expense return the affected Asset to a condition comparable

Casualty Loss. If (i) a Casualty Loss occurs and the good faith estimated cost
to repair or replace the destroyed or damaged Asset exceeds $10,000,000, or
(ii) a Casualty Loss occurs and (A) the cost to repair or replace the
destroyed or damaged Asset does not exceed $10,000,000 and (B) SELLER elects
not to repair or replace such damaged or destroyed Asset, BUYER may elect to
terminate this Agreement, by issuing a notice to SELLER within 10 days after
the later to occur of (i) or (ii).

after Closing, BUYER shall remove the names of SELLER and its Affiliates,
including "DCP," "CENTANA" and all variations thereof, from the Assets. As
soon as reasonably possible after the Closing, BUYER shall make the requisite
filings with, and provide the requisite notices to, the appropriate
Governmental Authorities to reflect that BUYER has title to the Assets. BUYER

Section 7.5, neither Party, nor any of their Affiliates, shall be required by
this Section 7.5 to take any action that would require or result in holding
separate or divesting assets or operations of SELLER, BUYER or any of their
Affiliates in order to have satisfied their obligation under this Section 7.5.

(d) The applicable filing fees in connection with the filings required to be
made under the HSR Act shall be borne 50% by BUYER and 50% by SELLER.

in good faith and use all commercially reasonable efforts, as promptly as
practicable to obtain all consents, approvals or actions of, to make all

that the cost to obtain Post-Closing Consents shall be borne by BUYER.

(b) Post-Closing FERC Filings. SELLER will timely prepare and file the Index
of Customers that DIGP must file with the FERC prior to the Closing Date.
BUYER will timely prepare and file the Index of Customers that DIGP must file
with the FERC for any periods from and after the Closing Date. BUYER will
timely make all additional filings with the FERC that are due in respect of
the activities of DIGP subsequent to the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing FERC
Filings"). If SELLER possesses information not included in the Assets that
BUYER requires to prepare and make the Post-Closing FERC Filings, SELLER will
cooperate with BUYER to supply such information for inclusion in the Post-
Closing FERC Filings.

(c) BUYER will specifically identify in DIGP's Annual Report of Activity for
Calendar Year 2014 under the Blanket Certificate issued pursuant to 18 CFR
Section 157.207 the fact that DIGP transferred its interests in the Tekas
System and the Roberts Ranch System to an Affiliate of SELLER prior to the
Closing. SELLER will cooperate with BUYER to supply specific information
necessary to make such disclosure in DIGP's Annual Report.

7.7 Preservation of Records.

(a) For a period of seven years after the Effective Closing Date, the Party in
possession of the originals of the Records will retain such Records at its
sole cost and expense and will make such Records available to the other Party
upon reasonable notice for inspection and/or copying, at the expense of the
requesting Party, at the headquarters of the Party in possession (or at such
other location in the United States as the Party in possession may designate
in writing to the other Party) at reasonable times and during regular office
hours. SELLER may retain a copy of the Records.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, SELLER will
transfer to BUYER SELLER's original files and Records relating to the
Controlled Entities and the Assets. If any contracts or agreements are only
being partially assigned, SELLER will retain the original files and transfer
to BUYER copies of those portions of the files that are applicable to the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement. The cost transfer of any
original files and Records pursuant to this Section shall be borne by BUYER up
to $5,000 and by SELLER for all amounts exceeding $5,000.

7.8 Employees.

(a) SELLER will, within five days of the Execution Date, provide BUYER with a
list of certain of the employees who are assigned on a full time or primary
basis to the operations of one or more of the Controlled Entities (the
"Business Employees") and, with respect to each Business Employee, the
Business Employee's name, title, compensation, date of hire, start date of
current position, all benefits offered by SELLER to each Business Employee,
his or her accrued and unused vacation time as of the date when such list is
provided, and incentive targets.

(b) BUYER, or an Affiliate of BUYER, may hire certain Business Employees
following interviews with the Business Employees. BUYER has the right to
interview the Business Employees during normal working hours (including onsite
interviews) consistent with the operating requirements of the Controlled
Entities, applicable Law and, with the written permission of each such
employee, may review and retain copies of personnel records. No later than 30
days after the Execution Date, BUYER will deliver to SELLER a written list
containing the name and proposed offer (including base pay and benefits) of
all of the Business Employees to whom BUYER wishes to make offers of
employment. Business Employees who accept the BUYER's offer of employment
shall be considered employees of BUYER, or an Affiliate of Buyer, as of the
Closing Date and their employment by DCP terminated on the Closing Date. The
Business Employees who accept and actually commence employment with BUYER, or
an Affiliate of Buyer, on the Closing Date (unless the Parties mutually agree
to a later commencement date) are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Continuing Employees."

(c) Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, SELLER is responsible
for all compensation and benefits owing to Business Employees up to the
Effective Closing Date, and BUYER is not responsible for the foregoing. Should
a Claim be made against BUYER for such compensation and benefits, SELLER will
indemnify BUYER and hold it harmless against such Claims, including, but not
limited to, damages, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs or interest.

(d) With respect to any employees of SELLER who perform services with respect
to any of the Assets and whose employment relationship with SELLER is
terminated by SELLER, SELLER shall comply with all applicable Laws in
connection therewith, including the WARN Act.

(e) With respect to the Continuing Employees:

(i) Each Continuing Employee shall be eligible to participate in the BUYER
benefit plans set forth on Schedule 7.8(e) (the "BUYER Benefit Plans") in
accordance with the terms of each such plan, based on the commencement of his
or her employment with the BUYER on the Closing Date, unless the Parties
mutually agree to a later commencement date. Such BUYER Benefit Plans are not
less than or inferior to the benefits received by other employees of BUYER's
employing Affiliate.

(ii) If BUYER terminates the employment of any Continuing Employee within 12
months after the Closing Date, unless such termination is for cause, BUYER
will pay such Continuing Employee severance based on terms of BUYER's
severance benefit plan in effect at the time, taking into account years of
service recognized by SELLER and years of service with BUYER.

(iii) BUYER shall grant all Continuing Employees credit for their service with
SELLER (and SELLER's predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility to
participate in and vesting credits in BUYER's service award, vacation programs
and policies and retirement plans. For the year during which such coverage
begins, BUYER shall credit under any medical and/or dental benefit plan
maintained by BUYER all Continuing Employees with any deductibles and co-
payments already incurred during such year under SELLER's group health plan,
and waive any pre-existing conditions, exclusions or limitations as to
coverage, any evidence-of-insurability provisions, and any waiting-period
requirements under such plans. BUYER shall apply towards any deductible
requirements and out-of-pocket maximum limits under such BUYER's welfare
benefit plans that are applicable to 2014, any similar deductible requirements
and out-of-pocket maximum limits satisfied by any Continuing employee under
SELLER's welfare Benefit Plans. Prior to the Closing, SELLER shall prepare and
deliver to each Continuing Employee and request such Continuing Employee to
deliver to BUYER a schedule setting forth the amount of the deductible and
out-of-pocket maximum limits satisfied by each Continuing Employee under
SELLER welfare Benefit Plans with the information available as of the date the
schedule is prepared, which schedule shall be updated through the Closing as
soon as reasonably practical after the Closing.

(iv) BUYER shall cause the trustee of BUYER's 401(k) plan trust to accept
direct rollovers from SELLER's 401(k) plan trust for each Continuing Employee
electing the same with respect to a distribution of his or her vested account
thereunder. In addition, participant promissory notes for any outstanding
loans of Continuing Employees under SELLER's 401(k) plan shall be rolled over
to BUYER's 401(k) plan trust. If any Continuing Employee does not rollover his
or her account to BUYER's 401(k) plan, such Continuing Employee may continue
to participate in SELLER's 401(k) plan as a terminated participant in
accordance with the terms thereof, and SELLER shall retain all responsibility
for the management and administration of such Continuing Employee's account
balances under SELLER's 401(k) plan.

(v) The number of vacation days that each Continuing Employee shall be
entitled under BUYER's vacation policies for 2014 shall be no less than the
number of remaining vacation days to which such employee would have been
entitled (determined assuming that such employee worked for the full calendar
year) under SELLER's vacation policies determined as of the Closing Time,
which such employee has not used and for which such employee has not been paid
by SELLER. Promptly following the Closing, SELLER shall provide BUYER with a
written exhibit showing the number of remaining vacation days for each
Continuing Employee.

(f) For the 12 month period following the Closing Date, if BUYER or any of its
Affiliates directly or indirectly (including as an employee, a contractor or
an employee of a contractor or subcontractor) retain the services of any
Business Employee to whom SELLER paid severance payments or benefits because
the employment of such Business Employee with SELLER was terminated, BUYER
shall immediately reimburse SELLER the actual amount or value of severance pay
that SELLER paid to such Business Employee.

(g) SELLER shall take all actions necessary to continue COBRA continuation
coverage to all individuals who are MandA Qualified Beneficiaries (within the
meaning assigned to such term under QandA-4 of Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9) with respect to the sale of the Subject Interests to the BUYER for
the duration of the period to which such individuals are entitled to such
coverage.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) nothing in
this Agreement shall create any obligation on the part of BUYER or any
Affiliate of BUYER to continue the employment of any employee for any definite
period following the Closing Date, and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall
preclude BUYER or any Affiliate of BUYER from altering, amending, or
terminating any of its Benefit Plans, or the participation of any of its
employees in such plans, at any time.

(i) No provision of this Section 7.8 shall constitute an amendment to any
Benefit Plan maintained by the BUYER, SELLER or an Affiliate of either the
BUYER or SELLER. Nor shall any provision of this Section 7.8 create any third
party beneficiary rights, or inure to the benefit of or be enforceable by, any
current or former employee, director, manager, service provider or the
dependent or beneficiary of any current or former employee, manager, director
or service provider or any Person representing the interests of any such
individual.

7.9 Credits and Receipts. With respect to the month in which Closing occurs,
revenues will be prorated between the Parties based upon the number of days
that have elapsed in the month. Subject to the foregoing and the other
provisions hereof (including the indemnification provisions hereof), all
monies, proceeds, receipts, credits and income attributable to the Controlled
Entities, the Non-Operated Interest and the Assets (as determined in
accordance with GAAP) (i) for all periods of time at and after the Effective
Closing Date, shall be the sole property and entitlement of BUYER, and, to the
extent received by SELLER, shall be promptly accounted for and transmitted to
BUYER and (ii) for all periods of time prior to the Effective Closing Date,
shall be the sole property and entitlement of SELLER and, to the extent
received by the Controlled Entities or BUYER, shall be promptly accounted for
and transmitted to SELLER.

7.10 Settlement of Intercompany Accounts and Termination of Intercompany
Contracts. The Parties acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing SELLER
will cause the Controlled Entities to settle all amounts receivable or payable
with any Affiliates in respect of Intercompany Agreements or otherwise such
that at the Closing Date no Controlled Entity will owe amounts to any SELLER
or to any SELLER Affiliate and neither SELLER nor any SELLER Affiliate will
owe any amounts to any Controlled Entity. Further, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that prior the Closing Date SELLER shall cause all Intercompany
Agreements to be terminated such that no Controlled Entity shall have any
further obligation under any Intercompany Agreements.

7.11 Idle Well Conductor Removal. If prior to Closing the three idle well
conductors located at Main Pass Platform 225 have not been removed from said
platform (the "Conductors"), SELLER will, as a post-Closing covenant, but not
as a condition to Closing, cause the Conductors or the portion thereof that
remain located at Main Pass Platform 225 to be removed in accordance with
SELLER's operating and engineering procedures, requirements, and standards and
in accordance with all applicable Laws. SELLER will bear the entire cost of
removing and disposing of the Conductors, and in consideration thereof, BUYER
agrees that SELLER will acquire title to and the right to sell or dispose of
the Conductors in such manner as SELLER may elect and to retain the proceeds
of any such action, so long as SELLER complies with the covenants of this
Section 7.11.

7.12 Like-Kind Exchange. Either BUYER or SELLER shall have the right at any
time prior to Closing to assign all or a portion of its rights (but not its
obligations) under this Agreement to a qualified intermediary in order to
accomplish the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner that
would comply, either in whole or in part, with the requirements of a like-kind
exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code. A Party that assigns its rights
under this Agreement for this purpose shall provide the other Party with prior
written notice. Any assignment of this Agreement to a qualified intermediary
shall not release the non-assigning Party from any of its liabilities or
obligations under this Agreement. No Party shall be obligated to pay any
additional costs or incur any additional obligations under this Agreement if
such costs or additional obligations are the result of the other Party's like-
kind exchange, and a Party electing to participate in a like-kind exchange
agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the other Party from and against all
claims, losses and liabilities, if any, resulting from the like-kind exchange.
The rights of the Parties shall not be affected by any determination that the
transaction does not qualify as a like-kind exchange.

7.13 Cooperation and Reasonable Efforts. The Parties agree to cooperate with
each other and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of the
conditions precedent to Closing to be satisfied as soon as practicable.

7.14 Resignation of Officers and Managers. At the Closing, SELLER shall
deliver to BUYER evidence reasonably satisfactory to BUYER of the
Resignations, effective as of the Closing.

7.15 Conveyance of the Transferred Assets. On or before the Closing Date,
SELLER shall assign and convey the Transferred Assets (including all past,
present and future liabilities and obligations relating thereto) to an
Affiliate of SELLER. After Closing, regardless of when and by whom the actual
invoice or demand for payment is received, SELLER shall pay and be responsible
for all past, present and future liabilities and obligations associated with
the Transferred Assets.



7.16 Termination of Derivative Contracts. SELLER shall terminate all
Derivative Contracts to which any Controlled Entity is a party or to which an
Asset is bound, to the extent possible, prior to or contemporaneously with
Closing, but in any event no later than the second Business Day following the
Closing Date.

7.17 Confidentiality. After the Closing, SELLER and its Affiliates will hold,
and will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by Law,
all confidential documents and information concerning each Controlled Entity
and the business thereof, except to the extent that such information can be
shown to have been (i) previously known on a non-confidential basis by SELLER,
(ii) in the public domain through no fault of SELLER or its Affiliates or
(iii) later lawfully acquired by SELLER from sources other than those related
to its prior ownership of each Controlled Entity. The obligation of SELLER and
its Affiliates to hold any such information in confidence shall be satisfied
if they exercise the same care with respect to such information as they would

(i) no BUYER Indemnitee shall be entitled to assert any right to
indemnification after (1) with respect to the breach of any of the

Representations"), until the applicable statute of limitations expires;

(iv) none of the BUYER Indemnitees shall be entitled to assert any right to

(c) For purposes of determining rights and damages pursuant to this ARTICLE

contained in this Agreement shall be determined without regard to any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in said representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

(d) Any claim for indemnification under this Agreement made by any Party shall
be in writing, be based upon a Claim that is actually asserted (and, with
respect to a BUYER Indemnitee, be delivered in good faith prior to the
respective survival period under Section 11.3(b)(i)), and shall specify in
reasonable detail the specific nature of the Claim for indemnification
hereunder ("Claim Notice"). Any such Claim that is described in a timely
delivered Claim Notice shall survive from and after the applicable survival
period under Section 11.3(b)(i) with respect to the specific matter described
therein.

11.4 Notice of Asserted Liability; Opportunity to Defend.

(a) All Claims for indemnification hereunder shall be asserted and handled
pursuant to Section 11.3(a) and this Section 11.4. Any person claiming
indemnification hereunder is referred to herein as the "Indemnified Party" or
"Indemnitee" and any Person against whom such Claims are asserted hereunder is
referred to herein as the "Indemnifying Party" or "Indemnitor."

(b) If a Claim is asserted against an Indemnified Party or any Loss is sought
to be collected by an Indemnified Party from an Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall with reasonable promptness provide to the Indemnifying
Party a Claim Notice. The failure to give any such Claim Notice shall not
affect the rights of the Indemnified Party to indemnification hereunder unless
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby and then only to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from the receipt of the Claim
Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether it
disputes liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to the
Claim or Loss, or (ii) in the case where Losses are asserted against or sought
to be collected from an Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Party, whether
the Indemnifying Party desires at its own sole cost and expense to attempt to
remedy such Losses or (iii) in the case where Claims are asserted against or
sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party by a Third Person ("Third
Person Claim"), whether the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third Person Claim (which defense shall be at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, and with counsel of its
own choosing); provided, however, that any Indemnified Party is hereby
authorized prior to and during the Notice Period to file any motion, answer or
other pleading that it deems necessary or appropriate to protect its interests
or those of the Indemnifying Party (and of which it shall have given notice
and opportunity to comment to the Indemnifying Party) and not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party does not give notice to the Indemnified Party of
its election to contest and defend any such Third Person Claim within the
Notice Period, then the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result
obtained with respect thereto by the Indemnified Party and shall be
responsible for all costs incurred in connection therewith (including legal
fees and expenses).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party is obligated to defend and indemnify the
Indemnified Party, and (i) the Parties have a conflict of interest with
respect to any such Third Person Claim, or (ii) there are legal defenses
available to an Indemnified Party that are different or in addition to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party may, in its
sole discretion, separately and independently contest and defend such Third
Person Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the result obtained
with respect thereto by the Indemnified Party and shall be responsible for all
costs incurred in connection therewith (including legal fees and expenses).

(f) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice
Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against Third Person
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend all appropriate
Proceedings, with counsel of its own choosing, and such Proceedings shall be
promptly settled or prosecuted by it to a final conclusion. If the Indemnified
Party desires to participate in any such defense or settlement it may do so at
its sole cost and expense (subject to subsection (e) of this Section 11.4). If
the Indemnified Party joins in any such Third Person Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall nevertheless have full authority to determine all action to be
taken with respect thereto.

(g) Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party and its counsel in
contesting any Third Person Claim and in making any counterclaim against the
Third Person asserting the Third Person Claim, or any cross-complaint against
any person. No Third Person Claim may be settled or otherwise compromised
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnifying Party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any
corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree, in each case, that subjects the Indemnified Party to any criminal
liability, requires an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Party or imposes any continuing obligation on or requires any
payment from the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party's prior
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(i) At any time after the commencement of defense of any Third Person Claim,
the Indemnifying Party may request the Indemnified Party to agree in writing
to the abandonment of such contest or to the settlement, payment or compromise
by the Indemnifying Party of the asserted Third Person Claim, but only if the
Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to be solely liable for such Third Person
Claim; whereupon such action shall be taken unless the Indemnified Party
determines that the contest should be continued and notifies the Indemnifying
Party in writing within 15 days of such request from the Indemnifying Party.
In the event that the Indemnified Party determines that the contest should be
continued, the amount for which the Indemnifying Party would otherwise be
liable hereunder shall not exceed the amount which the Indemnifying Party had
agreed to pay to compromise such Third Person Claim; provided that, the other
Person to the contested Third Person Claim had agreed in writing to accept
such amount in payment or compromise of the Third Person Claim as of the time
the Indemnifying Party made its request therefore to the Indemnified Party,
and further provided that, under such proposed compromise, the Indemnified
Party would be fully and completely released from any further liability or
obligation with respect to the matters which are the subject of such contested
Third Person Claim.

(j) Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated
to be payable pursuant to this ARTICLE XI, the Indemnifying Party shall
satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) days of such agreement or such
final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. The Parties agree that should the Indemnifying Party not make full
payment of any such obligations within such five-day period, any amount
payable shall accrue interest from and including the date of agreement of the
Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable adjudication, at the Interest
Rate.

11.5 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants of
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification
with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any
of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or
any of its Representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the
Indemnified Party's waiver of any condition set forth in ARTICLE VII.

11.6 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. OTHER THAN DUE TO A PARTY'S FRAUD AND THE POST CLOSING
RECONCILIATION, AS BETWEEN THE BUYER INDEMNITEES AND THE SELLER INDEMNITEES,
AFTER CLOSING (A) THE EXPRESS INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS AND REMEDIES OF
THE PARTIES (OTHER THAN THE POST CLOSING RECONCILIATION PURSUANT TO SECTION
3.2) AND (B) NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS
SHALL HAVE ANY RIGHTS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES AS TO THE
SUBJECT MATTER CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OTHER THAN AS IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED
IN THIS AGREEMENT.

11.7 NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY WAIVER. WITHOUT LIMITING OR ENLARGING THE
SCOPE OF THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO
INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS HEREOF,
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LOSS OR CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATION IS THE RESULT OF THE SOLE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OF OR BY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

11.8 LIMITATION ON DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER SELLER OR BUYER BE LIABLE
TO THE OTHER, OR TO THE OTHER'S INDEMNITEES, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES; PROVIDED THAT, IF ANY OF THE SELLER INDEMNITEES OR BUYER INDEMNITEES
IS HELD LIABLE TO A THIRD PERSON FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES AND THE INDEMNITOR IS
OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH SELLER INDEMNITEES OR BUYER INDEMNITEES FOR THE
MATTER THAT GAVE RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES, THE INDEMNITOR SHALL BE LIABLE FOR, AND
OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE SUCH INDEMNITEES FOR SUCH DAMAGES.

11.9 BOLD AND/OR CAPITALIZED LETTERS. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE BOLD AND/OR
CAPITALIZED LETTERS IN THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTE CONSPICUOUS LEGENDS.

hereof, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other

(a) SELLER shall be liable for all SELLER Taxes to the extent not taken into
account in computing Final Net Working Capital.

(b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period,
the amount of any such Tax that is attributable to the portion of the period
ending on the Effective Closing Date shall be a SELLER Tax and shall be:

(i) in the case of ad valorem Taxes, the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis,
the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the period ending on and including the Effective Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period

(ii) in the case of all Taxes not described in Section 12.3(b)(i), the amount
that would be payable if the Tax period ended with (and included) the
Effective Closing Date; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and
including the Effective Closing Date and the period beginning after the
Effective Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period.

(c) To the extent that the amount of a SELLER Tax is known or can be
reasonably estimated at Closing or at the time of delivery of the Closing
Statement, such amount of SELLER Tax shall be included in the Estimated Net
Working Capital or Final Net Working Capital, respectively; provided, however,
that SELLER shall promptly pay to BUYER any SELLER Tax payable by BUYER to the
extent that such SELLER Tax was not taken into account in determining the
Final Net Working Capital; and, provided further, that BUYER shall promptly
pay to SELLER the amount for which a SELLER Tax taken into account in
computing the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the actual amount of such
SELLER Tax. Such payments shall be due to BUYER at the time that the payment
of a SELLER Tax is due or, in the case of a payment due to SELLER, at the time
the amount of the SELLER Tax to which the payment is with respect to is fixed
and determinable.

(d) SELLER and BUYER believe that the purchases and sales contemplated by this
Agreement are exempt from or are otherwise not subject to sales, use,
transfer, or similar Taxes. If any such sales, transfer, use or similar Taxes
are due or should hereafter become due (including penalty and interest
thereon) by reason of this transaction, BUYER and SELLER shall each be liable
for one-half of such Taxes.

(e) BUYER and SELLER shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes (each, a "Tax
Proceeding") imposed on or with respect to the Assets or the operations or
activities of the Entities. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

12.4 Assignment. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, provided that neither Party may assign this Agreement or any of its
rights or obligations arising hereunder without the prior written consent of
the other Party.

12.5 Entire Agreement, Amendments and Waiver. This Agreement, together with
the Transaction Documents and all certificates, documents, instruments and
writings that are delivered pursuant hereto and thereto contain the entire
understanding of the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and supersede all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings
relating to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that any covenant
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement that does not involve a
confidentiality obligation will survive Closing until performed. This
Agreement may be amended, superseded or canceled only by a written instrument
duly executed by the Parties. Any of the terms of this Agreement and any
condition to a Party's obligations hereunder may be waived only in a signed
writing by that Party specifically stating that it waives a term or condition
hereof. No waiver by either Party of any one or more conditions or defaults by
the other in performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall
operate or be construed as a waiver of any future conditions or defaults,
whether of a like or different character, nor shall the waiver constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

12.6 Severability. Each portion of this Agreement is intended to be severable.
If any term or provision hereof is illegal or invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the

of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

12.8 Governing Law and Dispute Resolution.

(a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, enforced in accordance
with, and interpreted under, the Laws of the State of Delaware without
reference to conflicts of Laws principles.

(b) Negotiation. In the event of any dispute, the Parties shall promptly seek
to resolve any such dispute by negotiations between senior executives of the
Parties who have authority to settle the dispute. When a Party believes there
is a dispute under this Agreement, that Party will promptly give the other
Party written notice of the dispute. Within 30 days after receipt of such
notice, the receiving Party shall submit to the other a written response. Both
the notice and response shall include (i) a statement of each Party's position
and a summary of the evidence and arguments supporting such position, and (ii)
the name, title, fax number, and telephone number of the executive or
executives who will represent that Party. If the dispute involves a Claim
arising out of the actions of any Person not a signatory to this Agreement,
the receiving Party shall have such additional time as necessary, not to
exceed an additional 30 days, to investigate the dispute before submitting a
written response. The executives shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and
place within 15 days after the date of the response and thereafter as often as
they reasonably deem necessary to exchange relevant information and to attempt
to resolve the dispute.

(c) Failure to Resolve. If the dispute has not been resolved within 60 days
after the date of the response given pursuant to Section 12.8(b) above, or
such additional time, if any, that the Parties mutually agree to in writing,
or if the Party receiving such notice denies the applicability of the
provisions of Section 12.8(b) or otherwise refuses to participate under the
provisions of Section 12.8(b), either Party may initiate legal proceedings to
enforce its rights under this Agreement.

(d) The provisions of Sections 12.8(b) and 12.8(c) shall not apply to disputes
regarding the Post-Closing Price Reconciliation, which are addressed in
Section 3.2.

(e) Choice of Forum. If any Proceeding should be instituted, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, such
Proceedings shall be brought and tried in, and the Parties hereby consent to
the jurisdiction of, the federal or state courts situated in Denver County,
State of Colorado.

(f) JURY WAIVERS. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DEMAND A
TRIAL BY JURY.

communication to be given hereunder by either Party shall be in writing and

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by either Party except with

Claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, it being the intent of

be referred to or disclosed in the Schedules. No disclosure in the Schedules
relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred. The inclusion of any information in the
Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by SELLER,
in and of itself, that such information is material to or outside the ordinary
course of the business or required to be disclosed on the Schedules. Each
disclosure in the Schedules shall be deemed to qualify all representations and
warranties of SELLER notwithstanding the lack of a specific cross-reference,
and any information disclosed in the Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed
for all purposes of this Agreement, provided that the relevance of such matter
is reasonably apparent.
