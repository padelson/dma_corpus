9.5 Procedure For IndemnificationThird Party Claims.

 

(a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under _Section_ __ _ 9.2_,
_9.3_ or _9.4_ of notice of the commencement of any Action against it, such
indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying party
under such Section, give notice (including the facts and circumstance known at
such time relating to the Action) to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying party
will not relieve the indemnifying party of any liability that it may have to
any indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying party
demonstrates that the defense of such action is materially prejudiced by the
indemnifying partys failure to give such notice.

 

(b) If any Action referred to in _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_ is brought against an
indemnified party and it gives notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement of such Action, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate in such Action and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the
indemnifying party is also a party to such Action and the indemnified party
determines in good faith upon the advice of outside counsel that joint
representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to
provide reasonable assurance to the indemnified party of its financial
capacity to defend such Action and provide indemnification with respect to
such Action), to assume the defense of such Action and, after notice from the
indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the
defense of such Action, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it
diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under
this _Article 9_ for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with
respect to the defense of such Action, in each case subsequently incurred by
the indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Action. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of an Action, (i) it will be
conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made
in that Action are within the scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no
compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the indemnifying
party without the indemnified partys consent unless (A) there is no finding
or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the
rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party; and (iii) the
indemnified party will have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to
an indemnifying party of the commencement of any Action and the indemnifying
party does not, within ten calendar days after the indemnified partys notice
is given, give notice to the indemnified party of its election to assume the
defense of such Action, the indemnifying party, to the extent it is obligated
pursuant to this Agreement, will be bound by any determination made in such
Action or any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified party.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good
faith and at the advice of outside counsel that there is a reasonable
probability that an Action may adversely affect its or its Affiliates
ability to carry out its business operations other than as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying
party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such
Action, but the indemnifying party will not be bound by any determination of
an Action so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its
consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

9.6 Procedure For IndemnificationOther Claims.

A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim
may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.

(b) No Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other Party

10.6 Governing Law; Forum.

 

This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York
without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws in any jurisdiction to
the extent that the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction would
be required thereby. Each Party consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York located in New York County, New York (or in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, if federal jurisdiction cannot be
obtained) for the adjudication of any Action relating to or arising out of
this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, and the Parties shall
stipulate that any such Action be designated as related to the Litigation.
Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in any such applicable
court and agrees not to plead or claim in any such applicable court that any
such Action brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any such Action may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such applicable court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party hereby agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document as provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.2_
shall be effective service of process for any such Action brought against
such party in any such applicable court. Each party hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such Action brought in such court shall be conclusive and
binding upon such party and may be enforced in any other courts to whose
jurisdiction such party is or may be subject by suit upon such judgment.

10.7 Waiver of Jury Trial.

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS.

10.8 Counterparts.

 

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective
when each Party shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the
other Parties. Until and unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by each other Party, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication). Electronic or facsimile
signatures shall be deemed to be original signatures.

 



22

    

10.9 Entire Agreement.

 

This Agreement, the XIP Purchase Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the
MCA constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the Parties with respect
thereto.

 

10.10 Severability.

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and
shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic
or legal substance of the Contemplated Transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the Contemplated Transactions be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

10.11 Specific Performance.

 

The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur
if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, without proof of actual damages (and each party
hereby waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to applicable Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach.
