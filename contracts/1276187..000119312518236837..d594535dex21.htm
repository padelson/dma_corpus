Entity_ ").

 

(c) Concurrently with the Closing, (i) ETE GP shall enter into an amendment to
the ETE Partnership Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as

set forth in the ETE LPA Amendment. 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of _Article_ __ _ VI_, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of
Latham and Watkins LLP, 811 Main Street, Suite 3700, Houston, Texas at 9:00
A.M., Eastern Time, on the second business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or at such other
place, date and time as ETE and ETP shall agree. The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date._ "

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at

with the relevant provisions of the DRULPA and DLLCA and in such form as
necessary to effect the Merger and to reflect a change in the name of the
Surviving Entity to "Energy Transfer Operating, L.P." (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "), to be duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by ETE and ETP in
writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the effective time of the

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT ON UNITS

 

Section 2.1 _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of ETE, ETP or Merger Sub or the holder of
any securities of ETE, ETP or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Common Units_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_,
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_, and _Section_ __ _ 2.4_,
each Common Unit issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Common Units owned by ETE or any Subsidiary of
ETE) shall be converted into the right to receive 1.28 (the " _Exchange Ratio_
") ETE Common Units (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(b) _Common Units Owned by ETE and its Subsidiaries_. The Common Units owned
by ETE and its Subsidiaries and issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Common Units issued
to ETE or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Pre-Closing
Transactions) shall be unchanged and remain outstanding.

(c) _Class_ __ _ E Units; Class_ __ _ G Units; Class_ __ _ K Units
and Preferred Units_. Each of the Class E Units, Class G Units, Class K
Units, Series A Preferred Units, Series B Preferred Units, Series C Preferred
Units and Series D Preferred Units that have been issued and are outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unchanged and remain
outstanding.

(d) _ETP GP Interest_. The ETP GP Interest shall be unchanged and remain
outstanding.

(e) _Limited Liability Company Interests in Merger Sub_. The limited liability
company interests in Merger Sub that had been issued and are outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall convert into, in the
aggregate, Common Units in an amount equal to the number of Common Units
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_.

 



4

    

(f) _Certificates_. As of the Effective Time, all Common Units converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article_ __ _
II_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of units
in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Units_ ")) that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such Common Units (a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and any distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(g)_, in each case to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Units in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, without interest, and
the right to be admitted as an ETE Limited Partner. ETE GP hereby consents to
the admission (as an ETE Limited Partner) of each Common Unitholder who is
issued ETE Common Units in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_, upon the
proper surrender of the Book-Entry Units or Certificate representing Common
Units and acknowledges that each such Common Unitholder shall be deemed
to have made a capital contribution to ETE. Upon such surrender of the Book-
Entry Units or Certificate (or upon a waiver of the requirement to surrender a
Book-Entry Unit or Certificate granted by ETE GP in its sole discretion) and
the recording of the name of such Person as a limited partner of ETE on the
books and records of ETE, such Person shall automatically and effective as of
the Effective Time be admitted as an ETE Limited Partner and be bound by the
ETE Partnership Agreement as such. By its surrender of a Book-Entry Unit or
Certificate, or by its acceptance of ETE Common Units, a Common Unitholder
confirms its agreement to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the
ETE Partnership Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, ETE shall appoint an exchange
agent reasonably acceptable to ETP (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose
of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Units with respect to Common Units
for the Merger Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event more than three business days following the
Effective Time, ETE will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to
each holder of record of Common Units as of the Effective Time (and, to the
extent commercially practicable, to make available for collection by hand,
during customary business hours commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, if so elected by such holder of record), whose Common Units were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter
of transmittal, which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry
Units to the Exchange Agent in such forms as ETP and ETE may reasonably
agree, including, as applicable, instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
and Book-Entry Units to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, ETE shall cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common
Units, an amount of ETE Common Units (which shall be in non-certificated book-
entry form) issuable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article_ __ _ II_. Following the Effective Time, ETE
agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed,
cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(g)_ and any ETE Common Units sufficient to pay any Merger
Consideration that may be payable from time to time following the Effective
Time. All book-entry units representing ETE Common Units deposited with the
Exchange Agent

 



5

    

 (including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)_) shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund._ " The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to
be issued or paid pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ II_ out of the Exchange
Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by ETE; _provided_ , __ that (i) no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Common Units and
ETE shall promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of holders of Common Units in the amount of any such
losses; and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the
United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days.

(c) _Exchange_. Each holder of Common Units that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, a Certificate (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), or Book-Entry Unit (which
shall be deemed surrendered upon delivery of a properly completed letter of
transmittal) and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
number of ETE Common Units representing, in the aggregate, the whole number
of ETE Common Units that such holder has the right to receive in accordance
with the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ II_. The Merger Consideration
shall be paid as promptly as practicable after receipt by the Exchange Agent
of the Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Units and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or on any
unpaid distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Units.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Unit shall, after
the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration paid upon surrender of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Units shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Common Units formerly represented by such
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Units.

 

(d) _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Unit is registered, it shall
be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making of
such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
surrendered Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Unit or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger
Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Unit is registered, it
shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Unit shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the
Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Unit or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



6

    

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration on the books of ETP of transfers of Common Units that
have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units representing Common
Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Common Units, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Units are presented to the Exchange Agent or ETE, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article_ __ _ II_.

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Common Unitholders 12 months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to ETE, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged such holders Common Units for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to ETE for delivery of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such holders Common Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ETE and
the Surviving Entity shall not be liable to any Common Unitholder for any
Merger Consideration duly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by Common Unitholders immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of ETE free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Distributions_. No distributions with respect to ETE Common Units issued
in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units until
such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Units are surrendered as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.
Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other
applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of
the ETE Common Units, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of
such surrender, all distributions payable in respect of any such ETE Common
Units with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or
prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the distributions payable with respect to such ETE
Common Units with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of distributions in respect
of ETE Common Units, all ETE Common Units to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be entitled to distributions pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

(h) _No Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
ETE Common Units shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, all fractional
ETE Common Units that a holder of Common Units converted pursuant to the
Merger would otherwise be entitled to receive as Merger Consideration (after
taking into account all Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) and Book-Entry Units) will be aggregated and then, if a fractional
ETE Common Unit results from that aggregation, be rounded up to the nearest
whole ETE Common Unit.

 



7

    

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by ETE, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as ETE may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Common Units represented by such
Certificate as contemplated by this _Article_ __ _ II_.

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. ETE and the Exchange Agent may deduct and withhold
as necessary from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, or under any provision of applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax
Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding is required, such deduction
and withholding may be taken in ETE Common Units). To the extent amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made. If
withholding is taken in ETE Common Units, ETE and the Exchange Agent shall be
treated as having sold such ETE Common Units for an amount of cash equal to
the fair market value of such ETE Common Units at the time of such deemed sale
and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate Tax authority.

 

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger_. ETP and ETE each acknowledges and agrees
that, for U.S. federal income and applicable state and local tax purposes and
pursuant to the Merger, each ETP Unaffiliated Unitholder will be deemed to
contribute its Common Units to ETE in exchange for the Merger Consideration
and the deemed assumption of each such Common Unitholders share of the
liabilities of ETP. ETP and ETE each acknowledges and agrees that, for U.S.
federal income and applicable state and local tax purposes, such deemed
transaction is intended to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss
pursuant to Section 721 of the Code but will be characterized as a disguised
sale transaction described in Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code with respect to
any amounts treated as a transfer of consideration pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.707-3(a)(1) (the " _Section_ __ _ 707 Consideration_")
(such deemed sale, a " _Disguised Sale_ ") (such treatment, the " _Intended
Tax Treatment_ "). Unless required to do so as a result of a "determination"
as defined in Section 1313 of the Code, each of ETP and ETE agrees not to make
any tax filings or otherwise take any position inconsistent with the Intended
Tax Treatment and to cooperate with the other party to make any filings,
statements, or reports required to effect, disclose or report the Intended Tax
Treatment.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of ETP Restricted Units and ETP Equity Plans_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the ETP Managing GP Board (or,
if appropriate, any committee administering any ETP Equity Plans) will take
all actions as may be necessary or required in accordance with applicable Law
and each ETP Equity Plan (including the award agreements in respect of
awards granted thereunder) to give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ to
provide that each unvested award of restricted units and/or restricted phantom
units that is outstanding under any ETP Equity Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time (collectively, the " _ETP_

 



8

    

  _Restricted Units_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any such ETP
Restricted Units, cease to relate to or represent a right to receive Common
Units and shall be converted into a right to receive a comparable equity award
with respect to ETE Common Units (a " _Converted ETP Restricted Unit Award_
"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding
award of ETP Restricted Units (including the right to receive distribution
equivalents with respect to such award), except that the number of ETP
Restricted Units covered by each such Converted ETP Restricted Unit Award
shall be equal to the number of Common Units subject to the corresponding
award of ETP Restricted Units multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole unit. With respect to each ETP Restricted Unit,
any distribution equivalent amounts accrued but unpaid as of the Closing will
carry over and be paid to the holder in accordance with the terms of such
Converted ETP Restricted Unit Award and subject to any vesting conditions
included therein. The agreements with each award holder regarding such ETP
Restricted Units shall be assumed by ETE, and such awards, as converted
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_, shall continue to be governed on and
after the Effective Time by the terms and conditions of such agreements
(subject to the adjustments required by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ after
giving effect to the Merger) and by the ETP Equity Plans, as assumed by ETE.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, ETE shall assume the obligations of ETP under
the ETP Equity Plans and shall assume such plans for purposes of employing
such plans to govern the Converted ETP Restricted Unit Awards and to make
grants of equity based awards relating to ETE Common Units following the
Closing. From and after the Effective Time, (i) all references to Common Units
in the ETP Equity Plans shall be substituted with references to ETE Common
Units; (ii) the number of ETE Common Units that will be available for grant
and delivery under each of the respective ETP Equity Plans shall equal the
number of Common Units that were available for grant and delivery under the
respective ETP Equity Plan prior to the Effective Time, as adjusted to give
effect to the Exchange Ratio (which number will include the number of ETE
Common Units subject to Converted ETP Restricted Unit Awards in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_); (iii) from and after the Effective Time, awards
under the ETP Equity Plans may be granted only to those individuals who were
eligible to receive awards under the respective ETP Equity Plans immediately
before the Effective Time (including any individuals hired on or after the
Effective Time who would have been eligible for such awards pursuant to the
eligibility provisions of the ETP Equity Plans as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time); and (iv) no participant in the ETP Equity Plans shall
have any right to acquire Common Units under the ETP Equity Plans from and
after the Effective Time. ETE shall reserve for issuance a number of ETE
Common Units equal to the number of ETE Common Units that will be available
for grant and delivery under the ETP Equity Plans from and after the Effective
Time, including ETE Common Units that will be subject to Converted ETP
Restricted Unit Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by _Section_
__ _ 2.3(a)_.

(c) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, ETE shall file a
Form S-8 registration statement (or such other appropriate form) with respect
to the ETE Common Units available for grant and delivery under the ETP Equity
Plans from and after the Effective Time and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long
as such ETE Common Units are available for grant and delivery under the ETP
Equity Plans. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, ETP shall
file a post-effective amendment to

 



9

    

 the Form S-8 registration statements filed by ETP on July 22, 2002, December
3, 2015 and May 2, 2017, as amended, in each case, deregistering all Common
Units thereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, ETE shall take such steps as
may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause the acquisition of
Converted ETP Restricted Unit Awards pursuant to the Merger by
each individual who is an officer or director of ETE to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-
Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such
matters.

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article_ __
_ II_ to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in
_Section_ __ _ 5.2_), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the number of outstanding ETE Common Units shall have been changed into
a different number of units or a different class by reason of the occurrence
or record date of any unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, split-up, unit distribution, combination, exchange
of units or similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such unit dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, unit
distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar transaction and to
provide the holders of Common Units the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 2.5 _No Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

apparent to ETE on the face of such disclosure that it is applicable to such
other section notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference
thereto and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such ETP Disclosure Schedule

(a) ETP and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports, schedules,
forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other
statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31, 2016
(collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis on
Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _ETP SEC Documents_ ").
The ETP SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of
the ETP SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to
the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other ETP SEC Documents), or, if amended, as finally
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be,
applicable to such ETP SEC Documents, and none of the ETP SEC Documents as of
such respective dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with
respect to the ETP SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of ETP, none of the ETP

14

    

(b) The consolidated financial statements of ETP included in the ETP SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of ETP and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners equity for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to ETP and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

(c) ETP has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to ETP, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed by ETP in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to ETPs principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by ETP in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. ETPs
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to ETPs auditors and
the audit committee of the ETP Managing GP Board (i) all significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect ETPs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for ETPs auditors any material weaknesses
in internal controls and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in ETPs
internal controls. The principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of ETP have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC with respect to the ETP SEC Documents, and the statements contained in
such certifications were complete and correct when made. The management of ETP
has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of ETPs internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2017, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of
ETP, as of the date of this Agreement there are no facts or circumstances that
would prevent its principal executive officer and principal financial officer
from giving the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance
sheet of ETP and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 (the " _Balance

Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance
Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business and (iii) for liabilities and
obligations incurred under or in accordance with this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,

 



15

    

 neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations
of any nature (whether or not accrued or contingent), that would be required
to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of ETP
prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than as have not
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) Neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among ETP and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such
Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, ETP in ETPs published financial statements or any
ETP SEC Documents.

nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in  _Section_ __ _

pending (or, to the Knowledge of ETP, threatened) by any Governmental
Authority with respect to ETP or any of its Subsidiaries or actions, suits or

any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, at law or in
equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are no orders, judgments
or decrees of any Governmental Authority against ETP or any of its

to have any of the ETP Permits would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse Effect. All ETP Permits are in full force
and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the ETP Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of ETP, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse
Effect. ETP and its Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2016 have not
been, in violation or breach of, or default under, any ETP Permit, except
where such violation, breach or default would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of ETP, no event or condition has occurred or
exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a
benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of ETP or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any ETP Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend
any ETP Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP
Material Adverse Effect.

foreign anti-corruption Laws that are applicable to ETP or its Subsidiaries;

such person; and (iii) to the Knowledge of ETP, is not being (and has not
been) investigated by any Governmental Authority except, in each case of the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), as would not have, individually or in the

representations and warranties of ETE set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 4.9_,
none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on
behalf of ETP specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a)

or any of its Subsidiaries under any such ETP Material Contract; and (iv) to
the Knowledge of ETP, as of the date of this Agreement no other party to any
ETP Material Contract is in default thereunder, nor does any condition exist
that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default by any
such other party thereunder.

which, if obtained, if the same were to expire or be revoked or terminated),

performed all its obligations with respect to such rights-of-way which are
required to be fulfilled or performed as of the date of this Agreement
(subject to all applicable waivers, modifications, grace periods

on the face of such disclosure that it is applicable to such other

admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had, would have or would
reasonably be expected to have, an ETE Material Adverse Effect), ETE GP, ETE
and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to ETP as follows:

interests, shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
material Subsidiary of ETE that are owned directly or indirectly by ETE have

registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an ETE Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 4.5 _ETE SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) ETE and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports, schedules,
forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other
statements required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31, 2016
(collectively and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis on
Form 8-K, and in each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _ETE SEC Documents_
"). The ETE SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case
of the ETE SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to
the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other ETE SEC Documents), or, if amended, as finally
amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such ETE SEC Documents,
and none of the ETE SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to the ETE SEC
Documents. To the Knowledge of ETE, none of the ETE SEC Documents is the
subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of ETE included in the ETE SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of ETE and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated

 



27

    

 results of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners equity for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of which has been or
will be, individually or in the aggregate, material to ETE and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 

(c) ETE has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to ETE, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
required to be disclosed by ETE in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to ETEs principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by ETE in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. ETEs principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to ETEs
auditors and the audit and risk committee of the ETE GP Board (i) all
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which
could adversely affect ETEs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for ETEs auditors any material weaknesses
in internal controls and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
ETEs internal controls. The principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer of ETE have made all certifications required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC with respect to the ETE SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct when
made. The management of ETE has completed its assessment of the effectiveness
of ETEs internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2017, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. To the Knowledge of ETE, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer from giving the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance
sheet of ETE and its Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date (including the
notes thereto) included in the ETE SEC Documents filed by ETE and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and
obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither ETE nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of ETE prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETE Material Adverse Effect.

 



28

    

(e) Neither ETE nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among ETE and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, ETE in ETEs published financial statements or any
ETE SEC Documents.

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been an ETE Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, ETE and its Subsidiaries have carried on
and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither ETE
nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in  _Section_ __ _
5.2(b)_ that, if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time without the prior written consent of ETE, would violate such
provisions.

 

Section 4.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or proceedings
pending (or, to the Knowledge of ETE, threatened) by any Governmental
Authority with respect to ETE or any of its Subsidiaries or actions, suits or
proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of ETE, threatened) against ETE or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, at law or
in equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are no orders,
judgments or decrees of any Governmental Authority against ETE or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETE Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 4.8 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) ETE and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December 31, 2016 and
their respective dates of incorporation, formation or organization have been,
in compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any
applicable Laws, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETE Material Adverse Effect.

(b) ETE and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits (including
Environmental Permits) necessary for ETE and its Subsidiaries to own, lease

would cause) an applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue,
renew or extend any ETE Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation by ETP_.

 

(a) ETP shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause ETPs and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to an ETP
Alternative Proposal, request the return or destruction of all
confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on behalf
of ETP or its Subsidiaries and immediately prohibit any access by any Person
(other than ETE and its Representatives) to any physical or electronic data
room relating to a possible ETP Alternative Proposal. Except as permitted by
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, (x) without the prior written consent of ETE, ETP
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)

of furnishing confidential information) or knowingly induce or take any other
action intended to lead to any inquiries or any proposals that constitute or
could reasonably be expected to lead to an ETP Alternative Proposal, (ii)

exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to
an ETP Alternative Proposal, or (iv) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to ETE, the ETP
Board Recommendation or publicly recommend the approval or adoption of,
or publicly approve or adopt, or propose to publicly recommend, approve or
adopt, any ETP Alternative Proposal, or fail to recommend against acceptance
of any tender offer or exchange offer for Common Units within ten (10)
business days after commencement of such offer, or resolving or agreeing to
take any of the foregoing actions, and (y) subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_,
within five business days of receipt of a written request of ETE following the
receipt by ETP of any ETP Alternative Proposal, ETP shall publicly reconfirm
the ETP Board Recommendation; _provided_ , __ that, in the event that ETE
requests such public reconfirmation of the ETP Board Recommendation, then ETP
may not unreasonably withhold, delay (beyond the five business day period) or
condition the public reconfirmation of the ETP Board Recommendation and
_provided_ , _further_ , that ETE shall not be permitted to make such request
on more than one occasion in respect of each ETP Alternative Proposal and
each material modification to an ETP Alternative Proposal, if any (the taking
of any action described in clause (x)(iii) or clause (x)(iv) or the failure to
take the action described in clause (y) being referred to as an " _ETP
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "; provided, however, that to the extent any
such action was taken solely by Representatives of ETE or by ETP at the
direction of Representatives of ETE, it will not be deemed an "ETP Adverse
Recommendation Change"). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that
any violation of the foregoing restrictions by ETPs Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_
by ETP unless (i) such violation is committed without the Knowledge of ETP and
ETP uses its reasonable best efforts to promptly cure such violation once ETP
is made aware of such violation or (ii) such Representative is also a
Representative of ETE and acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, ETE.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.3(a)_, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the ETP Unitholder Approval and ETP Unaffiliated Unitholder
Approval, (i) ETP has received a written ETP Alternative

 



43

    

 Proposal that the ETP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the ETP
Conflicts Committee) believes is bona fide, (ii) the ETP Managing GP Board
(upon the recommendation of the ETP Conflicts Committee), after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines in good
faith that (A) such ETP Alternative Proposal constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to or result in an ETP Superior Proposal and (B) failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable
Law, as modified by the ETP Partnership Agreement and (iii) such ETP
Alternative Proposal did not result from a material breach of Section 5.3(a),
then ETP may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish information,
including confidential information, with respect to ETP and its Subsidiaries
to the Person making such ETP Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations regarding such ETP Alternative Proposal;
_provided_ that (x) ETP will not, and will use reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives not to, disclose any non-public information to such
Person unless ETP has, or first enters into, a customary confidentiality
agreement with such Person and (y) ETP will provide to ETE non-public
information about ETP or its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or
made available to ETE prior to or substantially concurrently with providing or
making available such non-public information to such other Person.

(c) In addition to the other obligations of ETP set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 5.3_, ETP shall promptly advise ETE, orally and in writing, and in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, ETP
in respect of any ETP Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to
ETE, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry
or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers or
the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such notice
copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person
relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter shall
promptly keep ETE reasonably informed of all material developments affecting
the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and
ETP shall promptly provide ETE with copies of any additional material written
materials received by ETP or that ETP has delivered to any third party making
an ETP Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries
or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior
to obtaining the ETP Unitholder Approval and ETP Unaffiliated Unitholder
Approval, the ETP Managing GP Board and the ETP Conflicts Committee may effect
an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an ETP Alternative
Proposal or an ETP Changed Circumstance if the ETP Managing GP Board (upon
the recommendation of the ETP Conflicts Committee), after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, determines in good faith
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, as modified by the ETP
Partnership Agreement, and:

(i) if the ETP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the ETP
Conflicts Committee) intends to effect such ETP Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to an ETP Alternative Proposal:

 

(A) such ETP Alternative Proposal is bona fide, in writing and has not been
withdrawn or abandoned;

 



44

    

(B) the ETP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the ETP
Conflicts Committee) has determined, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that such ETP Alternative Proposal
constitutes an ETP Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the
adjustments offered by ETE pursuant to clause (E) below;

(C) ETP has provided prior written notice to ETE in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 8.9_ (the " _ETP Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of the ETP
Managing GP Boards intention to effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change,
and such ETP Superior Proposal Notice has specified the identity of the
Person making such ETP Alternative Proposal, the material terms and conditions
of such ETP Alternative Proposal, and complete copies of any written proposal
or offers (including proposed agreements) received by ETP in connection
with such ETP Alternative Proposal;

(D) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the ETP
Superior Proposal Notice as determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.9_ and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth
calendar day following the date of such delivery (the " _ETP Superior Proposal
Notice Period_ "), ETP shall (1) negotiate with ETE in good faith (to the
extent ETE seeks to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit the ETP Managing GP Board not to
effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change; and (2) keep ETE reasonably
informed with respect to the status and changes in the material terms and
conditions of such ETP Alternative Proposal or other change in circumstances
related thereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any material revisions to
such ETP Alternative Proposal (it being agreed that any change in the purchase
price in such ETP Alternative Proposal shall be deemed a material revision)
shall require delivery of a subsequent ETP Superior Proposal Notice and a
subsequent ETP Superior Proposal Notice Period in respect of such revised ETP
Alternative Proposal, except that such subsequent ETP Superior Proposal Notice
Period shall expire upon the later of (x) the end of the initial ETP Superior
Proposal Notice Period and (y) 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the
third calendar day following the date of the delivery of such subsequent ETP
Superior Proposal Notice; and

 

(E) the ETP Managing GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms
of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by ETE and, at the end of
the ETP Superior Proposal Notice Period, shall have determined in good faith
that (i) such ETP Alternative Proposal continues to constitute an ETP Superior
Proposal even if such revisions were to be given effect and (ii) failure to
effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
duties under applicable Law, as modified by the ETP Partnership Agreement,
even if such revisions were to be given effect.

 

(ii) if the ETP Managing GP Board (upon the recommendation of the ETP
Conflicts Committee) intends to effect such ETP Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to an ETP Changed Circumstance:

 



45

    

(A) ETP shall provide prior written notice to ETE in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 8.9_ (the " _ETP Recommendation Change Notice_ ") of the ETP
Managing GP Boards intention to effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change,
and such ETP Recommendation Change Notice shall specify the details of such
ETP Changed Circumstance and the reasons for the ETP Adverse Recommendation
Change;

(B) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the ETP
Recommendation Change Notice as determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.9_ and ends at 11:59 p.m. Central time on the date that is the fifth
calendar day following the date of such delivery (the " _ETP Recommendation
Change Notice Period_ "), ETP shall (i) negotiate with ETE in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
permit the ETP Managing GP Board, not to effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation
Change; and (ii) keep ETE reasonably informed of any change in circumstances
related thereto; and

 

(C) the ETP Managing GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms
of this Agreement irrevocably offered in writing by ETE and, at the end of
the ETP Adverse Recommendation Change Notice Period, shall have determined
(upon the recommendation of the ETP Conflicts Committee) in good faith that
the failure to effect an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change would
be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, as modified by the ETP
Partnership Agreement, even if such revisions were to be given effect.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent ETP or the ETP Managing
GP Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an ETP Alternative Proposal if
the ETP Managing GP Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided_ that any ETP Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with _Section_ __ _
5.3(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that describes ETPs
receipt of an ETP Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto shall not be deemed an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change.

shall hold information received from the other party pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_ in confidence.

 

(b) This _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall not require either party to permit any
access, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith
judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of
such party would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any
contract or Law to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is
subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such
party or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined
with respect to such information and such undermining of such privilege could
in such partys good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which
may be in-house counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such partys
position in any pending or, what such party believes in good faith (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) if such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,

parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto;
_provided_ that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto
shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such
information (including by entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement)
to the extent doing so (A) would not (in the good faith belief of the party
being requested to disclose the information (after consultation with counsel,
which may be in-house counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the
violation of any such contract or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such
privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or (B) could
reasonably (in the good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose
the information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel)) be managed through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements
pursuant to which appropriately designated Representatives of the other party
shall be provided access to such information; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the party being requested to disclose the information shall (1) notify the
other party that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its
Subsidiaries obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably
likely to cause such privilege to be undermined, (2) communicate to the other
party in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the
subject matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in
accordance with the first proviso in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_) and (3) in
the case where such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its

otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of such contract).

communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person

or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to
the Closing in _Article_ __ _ VI_ and (iv) any material failure of such party
to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied of
any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article_ __ _ VI_; _provided_ that,
in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), the failure to comply with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of
the conditions to the Closing in _Article_ __ _ VI_, or give rise to any
right to terminate this Agreement under _Article_ __ _ VII_, if the
underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself
give rise to such failure or right.

 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_, (i) " _Indemnified Person_ "
shall mean any person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to
the Effective Time, an officer or director of ETP, ETP Managing GP, ETE, ETE
GP or any of their respective Subsidiaries and also with respect to any such
Person, in their capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee
or fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not
such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with ETP) serving at the
request of or on behalf of ETP, ETP Managing GP, ETE, ETE GP or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and together with such Persons heirs, executors or
administrators and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall mean any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or otherwise and whether or not such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation results in a formal civil
or criminal litigation or regulatory action.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that ETP, ETP
Managing GP, ETP GP or any applicable Subsidiary thereof would be permitted
to indemnify an Indemnified Person, ETE agrees to (i) indemnify and hold
harmless against any cost or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
(including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
connection with or in respect of any thereof) in connection with any
Proceeding, and provide advancement promptly, and in any event within 10 days
after any written request, of expenses to, all Indemnified Persons to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii) honor the provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,
directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained in the ETP
Charter Documents and comparable governing instruments of ETP Managing GP, ETP
GP and any Subsidiary of ETP, ETP Managing GP or ETP GP immediately prior to
the Effective Time and ensure that the organizational documents of the
Surviving Entity, ETP Managing GP and ETE GP shall, for a

 



50

    

 period of six years following the Effective Time, contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors, officers and agents of ETP, ETP
Managing GP, ETP GP and their respective Subsidiaries than are presently set
forth in the ETP Charter Documents and comparable governing instruments of ETP
Managing GP and ETP GP (it being acknowledged and agreed that the provisions
of the ETE Charter Documents and comparable governing instruments of ETP
Managing GP and ETP GP currently in effect are no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of such Persons
than are presently in the ETP Charter Documents and comparable governing
instruments of ETP Managing GP and ETP GP). Any right of indemnification of an
Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.8(b)_ shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Person as provided herein.

 

(c) The Surviving Entity shall maintain in effect for six years from the
Effective Time ETPs and ETP Managing GPs current directors and officers
liability insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Persons ( _provided_ that
the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies with reputable carriers
of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less
favorable to the Indemnified Persons); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Entity be required to expend pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.8(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current
annual premiums paid by ETP or ETP Managing GP for such insurance (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity would be required to
expend more than the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Entity shall obtain the
maximum amount of such insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. If
ETP or ETP Managing GP in its sole discretion elects, then, in lieu of the
obligations of ETE under this _Section_ __ _ 5.8(c)_, ETP or ETP Managing GP
may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect
to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the
Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such
Indemnified Persons in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event
shall the cost of such policy exceed six times the Maximum Amount.

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section_ __ _
5.8_ shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may
have under the organizational documents of ETP, ETP GP, ETP Managing GP, the
Surviving Entity, ETE GP, the DRULPA or the DLLCA. The provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.8_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby for a period of six years and are expressly intended to
benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs
and representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any
claim or claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 5.8_ are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of all such claims. If the Surviving Entity or any
of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their
businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in each such case, to the
extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Entity shall assume the obligations of the Surviving
Entity set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_.

 



51

    

Section 5.9 _Securityholder Litigation_. Each of ETP and ETE shall give the
other the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
securityholder litigation against such party and/or its officers and directors
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that the party
subject to the litigation shall in any event control such defense and/or
settlement (subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.2(a)(xii)_ and _Section_ __ _
5.2(b)(viii)_) and shall not be required to provide information if doing so
would be reasonably expected to threaten the loss of any attorney-client
privilege or other applicable legal privilege.

Section 5.10  _Financing Matters_. ETP hereby consents to ETEs use of and
reliance on any audited or unaudited financial statements relating to ETP and
its consolidated Subsidiaries, any ETP Joint Ventures or entities or
businesses acquired by ETP reasonably requested by ETE to be used in any
financing or other activities of ETE, including any filings that ETE desires
to make with the SEC. In addition, ETP will use commercially reasonable
efforts, at ETEs sole cost and expense, to obtain the consents of any
auditor to the inclusion of the financial statements referenced above in
appropriate filings with the SEC. Prior to the Closing, ETP will provide such
assistance (and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
personnel and advisors to provide such assistance), as ETE may reasonably
request in order to assist ETE in connection with financing activities,
including any public offerings to be registered under the Securities Act or
private offerings. Such assistance shall include, but not be limited to, the
following: (i) providing such information, and making available such personnel
as ETE may reasonably request; (ii) participation in, and assistance with, any
marketing activities related to such financing; (iii) participation by senior
management of ETP in, and their assistance with, the preparation of rating
agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies; (iv) taking such
actions as are reasonably requested by ETE or its financing sources to

and marketable securities of ETP or ETE to be made available to finance the
transactions contemplated hereby at the Effective Time.

Section 5.11 _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby including all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of
third parties incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and

transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective
party incurring such fees and expenses (other than the filing fee payable to
the SEC in connection with the Registration Statement and the filing fee
payable in connection with the filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act, which shall each be borne one half by ETP and one
half by ETE).

 

Section 5.12 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, ETE and
ETP shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Common Units (including
derivative securities with respect to Common Units) or acquisitions of ETE
Common Units (including derivative securities with respect to ETE Common
Units) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to ETP, or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to ETE, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



52

    

Section 5.13 _Listing_. ETE shall cause the ETE Common Units to be issued

Effective Time, each of ETE and ETP shall coordinate with the other regarding
the declaration of any distributions in respect of ETE Common Units, Common
Units and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the parties that holders of Common Units shall not receive,
for any quarter, distributions both in respect of Common Units and also
distributions in respect of ETE Common Units, as the case may be, that they
receive in exchange therefor in the Merger, but that they shall receive for
any such quarter either: (a) only distributions in respect of Common Units or

Merger.

 

Section 5.15 _Conflicts Committees_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) ETP Managing GP shall not, without the
consent of the ETP Conflicts Committee, eliminate the ETP Conflicts

that is a member of the ETP Conflicts Committee either as a member of the
ETP Managing GP Board or the ETP Conflicts Committee, and (ii) ETE shall not,
without the consent of the ETP Conflicts Committee, remove or cause the

Committee. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 5.15(b)_ shall
not apply to the filling of any vacancies caused by the death, incapacity or
resignation of any director in accordance with the provisions of the ETE GP
Agreement.

 

Section 5.16 _Voting and Consent_. ETE covenants and agrees that, until the
Effective Time or the earlier of a termination of this Agreement, at the ETP

Partners, however called, ETE will vote, or cause to be voted, all
ETP Limited Partner Interests then owned beneficially or of record by it or
any of its Subsidiaries, as of the record date for such meeting, in favor of
the approval of this Agreement (as it may be amended or otherwise modified
from time to time) and the Merger and the approval of any actions required in
furtherance thereof. ETE consents to, and has caused or shall cause, to the
extent necessary and to the extent permitted by the organizational documents
thereof, each of its Subsidiaries to consent to, this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by

 



53

    

 this Agreement and any amendments of the ETP Partnership Agreement
(including the ETP LPA Amendment) that are necessary or advisable in order to
implement the Pre-Closing Transactions. ETE further acknowledges that any

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by ETP or ETE pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed ETP Unitholder Vote_ ] in a case where
an ETP Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred, (ii) by ETP pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_ _[ETP Superior Proposal]_ or (iii) by ETE pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(i)_ [ _ETP Adverse Recommendation Change_ ] or
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(ii)_ [ _ETP Willful Breach_ ] (without limiting ETEs
remedies described in  _Section_ __ _ 8.8_), then ETP shall pay to ETE a
termination fee equal to $750 million, less any ETE Expenses previously paid
by ETP pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_ (the " _ETP Termination Fee_ ").
ETP shall pay to ETE the ETP Termination Fee within two business days after
the date of termination, except that in the case of clause (iii) above, ETP
shall pay the ETP Termination Fee on the date of termination.

 

(b) Any payment of the ETP Termination Fee shall be made in cash by wire

pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ when due, such fee shall accrue
interest for the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a

6 of the Delaware Code. In addition, if ETP shall fail to pay the ETP
Termination Fee when due, ETP shall also pay all of ETEs reasonable costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect
such fee. ETP, ETE and Merger Sub acknowledge that the provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
hereby and that, without these agreements, none of ETP, ETE or Merger Sub
would enter into this Agreement. The parties agree that in the event that ETP
pays the ETP Termination Fee to ETE, ETP shall have no further liability to
ETE of any kind in respect of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and that in no event shall ETP be required to pay the ETP Termination
Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) In the event of termination of this Agreement (i) by either party pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed ETP Unitholder Vote_ ] (or a
termination by ETP pursuant to a different provision of _Section_ __ _ 7.1_
at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(iii)_ [ _Failed ETP Unitholder Vote_ ]) or (ii) by ETE pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(ii)_ [ _ETP Willful Breach_ ], then ETP shall promptly,

expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources,
hedging counterparties, experts and consultants) incurred by ETE and its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of $30 million (the "

Managing GP Board or the ETE GP Board takes or authorizes any action under
this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ or otherwise grants any consent under this Agreement
without the concurrence of the ETP Conflicts Committee or the ETE Conflicts
Committee, as applicable, then the ETP Conflicts Committee or the ETE
Conflicts Committee, as applicable, may rescind its approval of this
Agreement, with such rescission resulting in the rescission of "Special
Approval" under Section 7.9 of the ETP Partnership Agreement or Section 7.9
of the ETE Partnership Agreement, as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by ETP or ETE in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 8.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties except that (a) ETE may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of ETE, but no such assignment shall
relieve ETE of any of its obligations hereunder, (b) Merger Sub may assign, in
its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of ETE, but no such
assignment shall relieve ETE or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder

interests under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of ETP, but no
such assignment shall relieve ETP of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject

benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under
this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken

and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies
hereunder, except for, in the case of clause (b), (i) the provisions of

occurred).

 

Section 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally
and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
8.7_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



62

    

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 8.8_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (a) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Each party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.8_,
and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. The
parties agree that in the event that ETE receives the ETP Termination Fee,
ETE may not seek any award of specific performance under this _Section_ __ _
8.8_.

party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
