SECTION 3.04 Payments; Exchange Procedures.



(a) Parent, CSC and the CSC Representative shall mutually appoint the Escrow
Agent to act as paying agent for the payment of the Closing Merger
Consideration and, if applicable, any Milestone Payment in accordance with
this Article III and, in connection therewith, shall promptly enter into that
certain Escrow Agreement with the Escrow Agent in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (subject to such modifications thereof as the
Escrow Agent shall reasonably request prior to the Closing and as shall be
accepted by Parent and CSC (such acceptance not to be unreasonably denied))
(the "Escrow Agreement"). The stock certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock held in escrow shall bear restrictive legends as set forth
in the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agreement shall prohibit transfers of
interests in the Escrow Account or any of the Closing Common Stock
Consideration, directly or indirectly, until released from the Escrow Account.



(b) At or promptly after the First Effective Time, Parent shall:

(i)repay the Closing Indebtedness (as set forth in the Consideration
Spreadsheet) on behalf of the CSC Group in full pursuant to the Payoff
Letters;

(ii)pay the CSC Expenses (as set forth in the Consideration Spreadsheet), on
behalf of the CSC Group in full;

(iii)deposit with the Escrow Agent out of the Closing Transaction Value the
CSC Expenses Escrow Amount, to be held on behalf of the CSC Securityholders as
of the First Effective Time in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement;

(iv)pay, or cause to be paid, out of the Closing Transaction Value shares of
Parent Common Stock (valued at $7.13 per share) equal to seventy five percent
(75%) of the Liquidation Preference Amount as of the Closing and as specified
in the Consideration Spreadsheet, to the holders of CSC Preferred Stock as of
the First Effective Time;

(v)deposit with the Escrow Agent out of the Closing Transaction Value shares
of Parent Common Stock (valued at $7.13 per share) equal to twenty five
percent (25%) of the Liquidation Preference Amount as of the Closing as
specified in the Consideration Spreadsheet, to be held on behalf of the
holders of CSC Preferred Stock as of the First Effective Time;

(vi)with respect to the balance of the Closing Transaction Value not paid out
or deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to clauses (iii) through (v) above
(such balance amount, the "Closing Common Stock Consideration"), pay, or
caused to be paid, shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at $7.13 per share)
equal to seventy five (75%) of the Closing Common Stock Consideration to the
holders of CSC Common Stock and CSC Options as of the First Effective Time
(treating such holders of CSC Options as the holders of the Net Option Shares
underlying such CSC Options) as specified in the Consideration Spreadsheet;
and

(vii)deposit with the Escrow Agent shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at
$7.13 per share) equal to the balance of the Closing Common Stock
Consideration not paid out pursuant to clause (vi) above to be held on behalf
of the holders of CSC Common Stock and CSC Options as of the First Effective
Time (treating such holders of CSC Options as the holders of the Net Option
Shares underlying such CSC Options).

For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock included in the Closing Merger Consideration shall be equal to the
Closing Transaction Value.



(c) Exchange Procedures. Within five (5) Business Days after the First
Effective Time, Parent and the CSC Representative shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to deliver to each CSC Stockholder a notice advising each such CSC
Stockholder of the occurrence of the Closing and the procedure for
surrendering to the Escrow Agent any certificates representing CSC Securities
("Certificates"), and directing each such CSC Stockholder to comply with the
terms of Section 10.09 (Public Announcements) hereof, in each case together
with a letter of transmittal in a form acceptable to Parent (each, a "Letter
of Transmittal"). If such CSC Stockholder has complied with the foregoing,
then such CSC 

Stockholder shall be paid on or promptly after the Escrow Agent's receipt of
such Letter of Transmittal, Certificates and other documents, the Termination
Date or the applicable Milestone Payment Date (each a "Payment Date"), the
amount, without interest, that such CSC Stockholder is entitled to receive in
respect of the CSC Securities evidenced by such Certificates pursuant to
Section 3.04 and Section 3.06 (as and when due hereunder) and the Certificates
so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. If a CSC Stockholder has not
delivered an executed Letter of Transmittal, together with its Certificates,
by the applicable Payment Date, then such CSC Stockholder shall be paid
promptly after the Escrow Agent receives such documents, the amount, without
interest, that such CSC Stockholder is entitled to receive in respect of the
CSC Securities evidenced by such Certificates pursuant to Section 3.04 and
Section 3.06 (as and when due hereunder) as provided in Section 8.05 and the
Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. Until so
surrendered, any outstanding Certificates shall be deemed from and after the
First Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right
to receive the amounts specified by Section 3.04 and Section 3.06 (as and when
due hereunder) and payable in respect of the CSC Securities evidenced by such
Certificates in accordance with such provisions.



(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Escrow Agent shall, on behalf
of Parent, pay, from the Closing Merger Consideration the amounts specified by
Section 3.04 and Section 3.06 (as and when due hereunder) in respect of the
CSC Securities evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof; provided, that
Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to
payment, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to
provide an agreement of indemnification, in form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, as indemnification against any claim that may be made with respect to
the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



(e) Transfers of Ownership. If the consideration payable in respect of CSC
Securities in accordance with Section 3.04 and Section 3.06 (as and when due
hereunder), as applicable, is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered,
then it shall be a condition of payment that (i) the Certificates so
surrendered are properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and (ii) the Person requesting such payment has (A) paid to Parent or the
Escrow Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
such consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or (B) established to the satisfaction of Parent or
the Escrow Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.



(f) Withholding for Payment of Taxes. Parent, the Surviving Company or the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Company or the Escrow Agent is required to deduct and withhold under
any applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
the Surviving Company or the Escrow Agent and paid to the proper Governmental
Authority pursuant to any applicable Tax Law, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Company or the Escrow Agent, and Parent, the Surviving Company or
the Escrow Agent as the case may be, shall (i) give written notice to each
such Person of any such withholding, and (ii) promptly provide any such Person
with any additional documentation required for such Person's Tax filings that
may be reasonably requested by such Person.



(g) Closing Share Consideration; No Liability. Subject to the second sentence
of this Section 3.04(g), any portion of the Closing Merger Consideration not
otherwise held in the Escrow Account or CSC Expenses Escrow Account (the
"Closing Share Consideration") that remains undistributed to the CSC
Stockholders as of the first anniversary of the Closing Date shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any CSC Stockholder (other than a holder
of Dissenting Shares) who has not complied with this Section 3.04 shall be
entitled to look to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held
by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company
or the Escrow Agent shall be liable to any CSC Securityholder for any
consideration delivered to a public official as required by any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Law.



(h) No Further Ownership Rights. Payment of the consideration pursuant to
Section 3.04 and 3.06 (in each case, as applicable), shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the CSC Securities
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Company of the CSC Securities which were outstanding as of
immediately prior to the First Effective Time. If, after the First Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 3.04.



(i) Fractional Amounts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Article III, in lieu of the issuance of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock in respect of the consideration payable to the CSC Stockholders
pursuant to this Article III, Parent shall pay (either via the Escrow Agent or
through payroll of Parent or the Surviving Company) to any CSC Stockholder who
would otherwise be entitled to receive such fractional share of Parent Common
Stock an amount in 

cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (A) $7.13 by (B)
such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
thousandth) that such individual would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to this Article III. To the extent any such fractional shares are
being held by the Escrow Agent, the parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to
return such fractional shares to Parent.



SECTION 3.05 Delivery of Certificates to Escrow Agent; Lock-Up.



(a) Promptly following the First Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Escrow Agent, for distribution in accordance with the Escrow Agreement,
certificates representing the Parent Common Stock included in the Closing
Merger Consideration in the name of the Escrow Agent for eventual distribution
to the CSC Securityholders consistent with the Escrow Agreement and the
Consideration Spreadsheet. So long as any shares of Parent Common Stock are
held in escrow, the Escrow Agreement shall provide that the shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be voted on any matter presented to the shareholders of
Parent by the CSC Representative.



(b) All certificates evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to the Transactions shall bear the following or similar legend on
their face, if required in compliance with federal and state securities Laws:



"THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT") NOR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE.
THESE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. FOLLOWING THE
EXPIRATION OF SUCH TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD,
OFFERED FOR SALE, OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT
IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH ACT OR AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT
REQUIRED PURSUANT TO A VALID EXEMPTION THEREFROM UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT."

(c) The Closing Share Consideration shall be issued subject to the following
transfer restrictions. The Closing Share Consideration may not be sold,
pledged, hypothecated, offered for sale, contracted for sale (including,
without limitation, any short sale), made subject to any option, right or
warrant to purchase or otherwise transferred, assigned or disposed of,
directly or indirectly (any of the foregoing, a "Transfer") without the
consent of Parent until the first anniversary of the Closing Date; provided
that, on the first Business Day following the six-month anniversary of the
First Effective Time, the foregoing restrictions shall lapse with respect to
50% of the Closing Share Consideration. No Transfer in violation of the
foregoing will be effective for any purpose or confer on any transferee or
purported transferee any rights whatsoever. The foregoing restrictions shall
also apply to any securities issued in the event of a stock dividend or
distribution, a forward or a reverse stock split or other reclassification of
shares of Parent Common Stock to the extent and for the duration that the
shares of Parent Common Stock with respect to which such securities were
issued are subject to the foregoing restrictions.



SECTION 3.06 Additional Consideration.

pursuant to the Public Health Service Act.

(ix)"Phase II Trial" has the meaning specified in 21 C.F.R. § 312.21(b).

(x)"Phase III Trial" has the meaning specified in 21 C.F.R. § 312.21(c).



(c) Diligence.



(i) During the Milestone Period, Parent directly, or through one of its
Subsidiaries, shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to achieve the
Milestones; provided, however, that Parent shall have no obligation to
continue to use such Commercially Reasonable Efforts if it determines that the
development and/or commercialization of the DC/TC Oncology Product is no
longer advisable or in the best interest of Parent and its stockholders.



(ii) If Parent or its Affiliates terminates or abandons all development and,
if commenced as of such time, commercialization activities with respect to the
Milestones, Parent shall send a written notice thereof to the CSC
Representative together with an explanation of the reasons for such cessation
of activities

(xi) 

(d) Recordkeeping. Until the earlier of (A) such time as all Milestone
Payments have been paid by Parent pursuant to this Section 3.06 or (B) Parent
has notified the CSC Representative that, despite using its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts, the Milestones have become incapable of fulfillment (the
"Milestone Period"), and thereafter, as needed for any audit requested during
the Milestone Period with respect to such Milestones, Parent shall, and shall
cause its applicable Affiliates to, maintain reasonable documentation,
consistent with Parent's customary practices and in compliance with applicable
Laws, regarding its activities relating to seeking and obtaining the
Milestones.



(e) Audit Rights. If the CSC Representative desires to pursue audit compliance
with this Section 3.06 during the Milestone Period, the CSC Representative
shall give written notice to Parent of its desire to conduct such audit (the
"Audit Notice"). Within ten (10) Business Days after Parent's receipt of the
Audit Notice, Parent shall afford the CSC Representative and an independent
accounting firm engaged by the CSC Representative (the "Representative's
Accountant") reasonable access, during normal business hours, to such
information in the possession of Parent and its Affiliates as may reasonably
be requested 

by the CSC Representative and the Representative's Accountant for the purposes
of determining compliance with this Section 3.06. The CSC Representative may
deliver an Audit Notice no more often than one (1) time per year.



(f) Reporting. Until the expiration of the Milestone Period, Parent shall
provide the CSC Representative, on a semi-annual basis, on or about February
1st and August 1st of each year within such period, a written summary in
reasonable detail regarding the status of its efforts to achieve the
Milestones and Parent's progress with respect thereto, including Parent's
then-current plans for progressing toward the achievement thereof (each such
report, an "Update Report"). Within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery
of an Update Report, if the CSC Representative requests in writing a meeting
with representatives of Parent to discuss such report, Parent shall make
available for such a meeting to be held in Parent's offices one or more
representatives (as determined by Parent); provided, however, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, at any such meeting, other representatives (including
counsel and advisors) of Parent and the CSC Representative may be present. The
CSC Representative may not request more than two (2) meetings with the Buyer
in any twelve (12) month period. In the absence of a timely written request by
the CSC Representative for such a meeting, Parent shall not have any further
obligations to hold any meeting. All information contained in any Update
Report, or conveyed to the CSC Representative in any meeting or other
communication regarding an Update Report, shall be subject to the
confidentiality obligations set forth herein. Each of the Parent and the CSC
Representative shall be solely responsible for bearing its own costs
associated with exercising its rights or performing its obligation under this
Section 3.06(f).



(g) Milestones Payable Only Once; Notice. The parties understand and agree
that, except as otherwise noted in Section 3.06(a)(7) and (a)(8), each of the
Milestone Payments referenced under Section 3.06(a) shall be payable only
once, upon the first occurrence of the applicable Milestone, and each such
Milestone Payment is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 3.06. Parent shall notify the CSC Representative or make a public
announcement within five (5) Business Days of its achievement of a Milestone
(the "Milestone Announcement Date").



(h) Payment of Milestone Payments. Subject to Parent's right to offset
pursuant to Section 8.06 and the provisions of Section 3.06(e), Parent shall
direct the Escrow Agent within two (2) Business Days following the relevant
Milestone Announcement Date or, if later, the date on which the Requisite
Milestone Approval has been obtained, to cause each Milestone Payment, if any,
to be paid to the CSC Representative for distribution to the CSC Stockholders
and the holders of CSC Options in accordance with the Consideration
Spreadsheet. Parent shall promptly notify the CSC Representative of the
occurrence of the Milestone Date and Requisite Milestone Approval if needed.



(i) Form of Milestone Payment. Except as provided in this clause (i), below,
Parent may pay each Milestone Payment in cash, shares of Parent Common Stock
or a combination thereof, in its sole discretion. Shares of Parent Common
Stock included in a Milestone Payment shall be valued at the Parent Share
Value as of the relevant Milestone Announcement Date. In the event that Parent
is to make a Milestone Payment in the form of shares of Parent Common Stock,
it shall be a condition to Parent's obligation to make such Milestone Payment
that Parent shall have obtained all approvals of its stockholders required to
be obtained prior to issuing such shares of Parent Common Stock under
applicable Law and Exchange rules, including NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(b) (the
"Requisite Milestone Approval"). Notwithstanding the discretion afforded to
Parent pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 3.06(i), in no event
shall any amount of any Milestone Payment be made in cash, and instead shall
be paid Parent Common Stock, if the amount of cash would exceed sixty percent
(60%) of the Total Consideration paid through and including the Milestone
Payment. For this purpose, "Total Consideration" means the sum of (i) total
cash paid in respect of CSC Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including,
but not limited to, cash paid for fractional shares, cash paid to holders of
Dissenting Shares, cash paid to unaccredited investors and cash paid as
Milestone Payments, plus (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Parent Stock
actually delivered prior to such Milestone Payment or deliverable with respect
to the Milestone Payment pursuant to this Agreement to the CSC Stockholders.
For this purpose, "Fair Market Value of the Parent Stock" means the volume
weighted average of the closing prices of sales of the Parent Common Stock on
the last trading date preceding the date on which the Parent Common Stock is
delivered to the CSC Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement. The intent of
the foregoing is to satisfy the continuity of interest requirement within the
meaning of Code Section 368, the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder and
judicial interpretations thereof. The determination of the amount of any
Milestone Payment that is payable in Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
foregoing shall be interpreted and applied to meet such requirements.



(j) Non-Transferability. The right of any CSC Securityholder to receive any
amounts with respect to a Milestone Payment (i) shall not be evidenced by a
certificate or other instrument, (ii) shall not be assignable or otherwise
transferable by such CSC Securityholder, except by will, upon death or by
operation of Law and (iii) does not represent any right other than the right
to receive the consideration set forth in this Section 3.06 on the terms set
forth hereunder if and to the extent payable. Any attempted transfer of the
right to any amounts with respect to a Milestone Payment by any holder thereof
(other than as specifically permitted by the immediately preceding sentence)
shall be null and void.

and financing arrangement relating to any Benefit Plan, (v) all contracts with
third-party administrators, actuaries, investment managers, consultants and
other independent contractors that relate to any Benefit Plan and (vi) for the

Labor and any other Governmental Authority regarding any Benefit Plan. No
Person in the CSC Group has any binding commitment or understanding to
establish any new Benefit Plan or to modify any Benefit Plan, except to the
extent required by Law.



(b) Neither CSC nor any ERISA Affiliate has, at any time within six years
prior to the date of this Agreement, sponsored, maintained or had an
obligation to contribute to (i) a pension plan (within the meaning of Section
3(2) of ERISA) subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a
multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA
or the comparable provisions of any other applicable Law) or (iii) a single

liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.



(c) Each Benefit Plan has been maintained and operated in compliance in all
material respects with its terms, all applicable collective bargaining
agreements and applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code. Except as set

involving any Benefit Plan or asserting any rights to benefits under any
Benefit Plan.



(e) No Person in the CSC Group nor any "party in interest" or "disqualified

requirements of ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Laws in connection
with the administration or investment of the assets of any Benefit Plan.



(f) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.17(f) or as provided by Section 3.02 of

combination with another event) (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming
due, or increase the amount of any compensation due, to any Covered
Individual, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Benefit
Plan, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of
any such compensation or benefits; and except as set forth in Schedule

as an "excess parachute payment," as such term is defined in Section 280G of
the Code. CSC has identified each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code)
subject to Section 409A of the Code, and each Benefit Plan so identified, to

Reports") complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder, and none of the SEC Reports, when filed, contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. All Taxes that Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is required to withhold or to collect for payment have been duly

material respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent as of the
dates shown and its consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods shown, and such financial statements have been prepared in conformity

nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities, contingent or
otherwise, except those incurred in the ordinary course of business,
consistent (as to amount and nature) with past practices since the date of

properties and all other properties and assets owned by it, in each case free
from Liens that would materially affect the value thereof or materially
interfere with the use made or currently planned to be made thereof by them;
and except as disclosed in the SEC Reports, Parent and each of its
Subsidiaries holds any leased real or personal property under valid and
enforceable leases with no exceptions that would materially interfere with the
use made or currently planned to be made thereof by them.

warranties contained in this Article V (including the exceptions and
qualifications thereto in the SEC Reports), none of Parent, Subco, Subco II or
any other Person has made or makes any other express or implied representation

significant historic business line of CSC, or use at least a significant

more members of Parent's "qualified group" have active and substantial
management functions as a partner with respect to CSC's historic business or
(B) members of Parent's "qualified group" in the aggregate own an interest in
the partnership representing a significant interest in CSC's historic
business, in each case within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(d)(4)(iii).

the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except as provided
in Article IV (and the exceptions and qualifications thereto set forth in the
CSC Disclosure Schedule), and that it is not relying and has not relied on any

SECTION 8.03 Limitations on Indemnification.



(a) Threshold.

(i) The Parent Indemnified Parties, as a group, may not recover any Damages
pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i) unless and until the Parent Indemnified
Parties, as a group, shall have paid, incurred, suffered or sustained at least
$190,000 in Damages (the "Threshold") in the aggregate, in which case the

incurred, suffered or sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties as a group
(subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII).

(ii) The CSC Indemnified Parties, as a group, may not recover any Damages

Parties shall be entitled to recover all Damages paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained by the CSC Indemnified Parties as a group.



(b) Caps; Recovery from Escrow Fund.

(i) The Parent Indemnified Parties' first source of recovery for
indemnification claims under Section 8.02 shall be recourse against the Escrow
Account, but if the Escrow Account is insufficient to satisfy any amounts of
Damages indemnified hereunder, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover the excess Damage by exercising its right to offset such
excess (such excess, an "Excess Damage ") against any and all Milestone
Payments as provided in Section 8.06.

(ii) Except in the case of fraud, and indemnification claims for breaches of
or inaccuracies in the Special Representations, the maximum amount that the
Parent Indemnified Parties may recover for indemnification claims under

(iv) Except in the case of a CSC Securityholder who has committed fraud, the

such Damages (net of any costs to recover such insurance payments and any
increased premiums resulting therefrom). Each Indemnified Party shall act in
good faith and a commercially reasonable manner to mitigate any Damages they
may pay, incur, suffer or sustain for which indemnification is available
hereunder to the extent required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the

any obligation to seek recovery from any third party or pursue recovery under
any insurance policy with respect to any Damage.



(d) Effect of Knowledge and Investigation. The rights of the Indemnified

of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by CSC or any other matter. The waiver of any condition based
on the accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the performance
of or compliance with any such covenant or agreement, or the receipt of any
certificate or opinion, will not affect the right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, payment of Damages, or any other remedy. No
Indemnified Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation,
warranty, certificate or other agreement in order for such Indemnified Party
to be entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder.

Indemnified Party hereunder for any unforeseeable consequential, special,
indirect, exemplary or punitive damages, except to the extent required to be

SECTION 8.04 Procedures.



(a) Third Party Claims.

(x)In the event that an Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion of
any claim or the commencement of any claim or similar proceeding by a third
party in respect of which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes indemnity
may be sought under the provisions of this Article VIII (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party
(and, if such Indemnifying Party is a CSC Securityholder, the CSC
Representative) in writing of such Third Party Claim (such notice, a "Notice
of Claim"). If the Indemnified Party fails to timely notify the Indemnifying
Party of the Notice of Claim and the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
reason of such failure, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent of such prejudice. The Notice of
Claim shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and shall
indicate the estimated amount or method of computation of the amount of such
claim, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party and such other information with respect
thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.

(xi)The Indemnifying Party will have twenty (20) Business Days from the date
on which the Indemnifying Party received the Notice of Claim (the
"Indemnifying Party Defense Review PeriodIndemnifying Party Defense Review
Period") to notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party desires
to assume the control of the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim
and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party and at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party (a "Third Party DefenseThird Party Defense"). If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the Third Party Defense in accordance herewith, (A) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless the
Indemnifying Party shall have failed during the Indemnifying Party Defense
Review Period to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim; (B) the
Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned; (C) the Indemnifying Party shall be conclusively
deemed to have acknowledged that the Third Party Claim is within the scope of
its indemnity obligation; (D) the Indemnifying Party shall conduct the Third
Party Defense actively and diligently and provide copies of all correspondence
and related documentation in connection with the Third Party Defense to the
Indemnified Party; and (E) the Indemnified Party will provide reasonable
cooperation in the Third Party Defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if counsel for the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines that there is an actual conflict between the positions of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in conducting the defense of such
Third Party Claim or that there are legal defenses available to such
Indemnified Party different from or in addition to those available to the
Indemnifying Party, then counsel for the Indemnified Party shall be entitled,
if the Indemnified Party so elects, to conduct the defense to the extent
reasonably determined by such counsel to protect the interests of the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable legal fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party; provided, that
the Indemnifying Party shall not be 

required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any appropriate local
counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim.

(xii)During the Indemnifying Party Defense Review Period and thereafter (if
the Indemnifying Party does not assume the Third Party Defense prior to the
end of the Indemnifying Party Defense Review Period), the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to assume the Third Party Defense with counsel of its
choice and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable legal
fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (provided, that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any
appropriate local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any
Third Party Claim); provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right, at its expense, to participate in such Third Party Defense but the
Indemnified Party shall control the investigation, defense and settlement
thereof. The Indemnified Party shall conduct the Third Party Defense actively
and diligently, and the Indemnifying Party will provide reasonable cooperation
in the Third Party Defense. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim in any manner and on such terms as it may deem
appropriate without the consent of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however,
that the amount of any settlement made or entry of any judgment entered into
by the Indemnified Party without the consent of the Indemnifying Party shall
not be determinative of the validity of the Claim or the amount of the Losses
related to such matter.

(xiii)Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party will not be
entitled to assume the Third Party Defense if:

(a)the Third Party Claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary damages,
any injunctive or other equitable relief;

(b)the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
action, indictment or allegation;

(c)a legal conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party in respect of the Third Party Claim; or

(d)the Third Party Claim would give rise to Damages which are more than the
amount indemnifiable by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VIII.



(b) Other Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
against any Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII that does not involve a
Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim
with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) calendar days
following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article VIII, such claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed
a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Article VIII and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified
Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim
(or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of
such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the
Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such
claim, as provided above, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if
not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by
litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction.



SECTION 8.05 Escrow Account; CSC Expenses Escrow Account.



(a) By delivering the Requisite Stockholder Approval or the Option
Cancellation Agreements, the CSC Securityholders shall be deemed to have
consented to the right of (i) Parent or any Parent Indemnified Party to
collect from the Escrow Account the amount of any Damages payable to Parent or
any of Parent Indemnified Parties in accordance with this Article VIII as and
when Parent or any of the Parent Indemnified Parties incurs or suffers such
Damages and (ii) Parent to collect from the CSC Expenses Escrow Account the
CSC Expenses Escrow Amount as provided in Section 8.05(b)(i).

commence on the Closing Date and terminate on the fifteen (15) month
anniversary of the Closing Date (such date of termination, the "Termination
Date", and such period, the "Escrow Period").

(i) If the CSC Expenses Offset Payments that are received by CSC or its
Affiliates equal at least $1,800,000 on or before the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent to release and distribute
the CSC Expenses Escrow Amount to the CSC Representative for distribution to
the CSC Securityholders in accordance with the Consideration Spreadsheet;
provided, however, that Parent may withhold from such distribution such amount
of shares of Parent Common Stock (valued at $7.13 per share) equal to the
amount of any CSC Expenses in excess of $1.8 million that have not been taken
as a reduction to the Closing Transaction Value. If the CSC Expenses Offset
Payments do not equal $1,800,000 on or before the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the CSC Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to release
and distribute to Parent an amount equal to $1,800,000 minus the amount of the 

CSC Expenses Offset Payments that have actually been received as of such
anniversary (valuing the shares of Parent Common Stock included in the CSC
Expenses Escrow Amount at $7.13 per share) and the remainder of the CSC
Expenses Escrow Amount shall be distributed to the CSC Representative for
further distribution to the CSC Securityholders in accordance with the
Consideration Spreadsheet.

(ii) As soon as practical after the Termination Date, Parent shall direct the
Escrow Agent to release and distribute to the CSC Representative for
distribution to the CSC Securityholders in accordance with the Consideration
Spreadsheet all shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Escrow Amount in
the Escrow Account that are not subject to an unresolved Notice of Claim.



(c) Claims Upon Escrow Account. In the event that a Parent Indemnified Party
delivers a Notice of Claim, it shall deliver such Notice of Claim to the
Escrow Agent. Thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Escrow Agent and
CSC Representative of a Notice of Claim (the "Claim Payment Date"), the Escrow
Agent shall deliver to Parent from the Escrow Amount shares of Parent Common
Stock (valued at $7.13 per share) equal to such Damages, unless the CSC
Representative has previously delivered to the Escrow Agent and Parent
Indemnified Party a Notice of Objection in respect of such Notice of Claim.



(d) Notice of Objection. In the event the CSC Representative intends to
dispute a Notice of Claim, it shall deliver a written notice to the Escrow
Agent and Parent prior to the Claim Payment Date that specifies in reasonable
detail the CSC Representatives good faith objections to the Notice of Claim
(such a notice, a "Notice of ObjectionNotice of Objection"). If the CSC
Representative delivers a Notice of Dispute, Parent and the CSC Representative
shall work together in good faith to resolve such dispute and shall, upon such
resolution, jointly instruct the Escrow Agent as necessary to implement such
resolution. If the CSC Representative shall not deliver a Notice of Objection
prior to the Claim Payment Date, the CSC Representative and the CSC
Securityholders shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to object
to such Notice of Claim.



SECTION 8.06 Offset Rights.



(a) Parent shall have the right and is hereby authorized at any time and from
time to time to set off and apply against any and all Milestone Payments the
amount of any Damages specified in a Notice of Claim delivered by Parent
hereunder prior to the date of the Milestone Payment against which such set
off is applied, including Parent's good faith estimate of any Damages
identified on such Notice of Claim which have not been liquidated (the amount
so withheld and set-off pursuant to this Section 8.06, the "Offset Amount");
provided, however, that the Offset amount shall be subject to the limitations
of this Article VIII.



(b) In the event Parent exercises its set off rights pursuant to Section
8.06(a) and withholds an Offset Amount from any Milestone Payment, Parent
shall notify the CSC Representative thereof in writing (the "Offset
Notification") no later than two (2) Business Days after such Milestone
Payment is due, which Offset Notification shall describe in particular the
claim for indemnification with respect to which such set off rights have been
exercised.



(c) In the event Parent exercises its set off rights pursuant to Section
8.06(a) and withholds an Offset Amount from any Milestone Payment with respect
to any Damages specified in the applicable Notice of Claim, upon the final
resolution, in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII, of the
claim for indemnification with respect to which the Notice of Claim is
delivered, Parent shall cause the CSC Representative to be paid the excess, if
any, of the Offset Amount over the amount of Damages to which Parent has been
finally determined to be entitled in connection with such resolution.



SECTION 8.07 CSC Representative.



(a) Appointment. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Mergers by the CSC Stockholders, each CSC Stockholder (regardless of
whether or not such CSC Stockholder votes in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Mergers, whether at a meeting or by written
consent in lieu thereof) hereby initially appoints, as of the date hereof,
Jason Livingston, as his, her or its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-
fact to enter into any CSC Document and the Transactions, and to: (i) give and
receive notices and communications to or from Parent and/or the Escrow Agent
relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions
and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby; (ii) authorize deliveries
(including by means of not objecting to claims) to Parent or any other Parent
Indemnified Party of cash from the Escrow Amount in satisfaction of claims
asserted by Parent (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Party,
including by not objecting to claims thereto) and authorize payments by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; (iii)
object to any Notice of Claim; (iv) consent or agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and agree to arbitration and comply with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to any such Notice of
Claim; (v) assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
agree to arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, any other claim or any dispute between the
parties to this Agreement or any CSC Securityholder that is related to this
Agreement or the Transactions; (vi) amend this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or any other agreement related to this Agreement or the 

Transactions; (vii) take any and all actions and do any and all things which
this Agreement specifies that the CSC Representative can or shall do; and
(viii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the CSC
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without
having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance.



(b) Acceptance. Jason Livingston hereby accepts his appointment as CSC
Representative.



(c) No Revocation; Replacement. Each CSC Stockholder acknowledges that Parent
is relying and shall rely on the authority of the CSC Representative granted
hereunder and will be materially prejudiced if this authority is revoked. Each
CSC Stockholder hereby agrees that it shall indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Parties for any Damages suffered as a result of a revocation by such CSC
Stockholder of the authority granted hereunder other than as provided for
herein. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Person serving as the CSC
Representative may be replaced from time to time by the holders of a majority
in interest of the Escrow Amount upon not less than ten (10) days' prior
written notice to Parent and with Parent's written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. No bond shall be required of the CSC Representative,
and the CSC Representative shall receive no compensation for his services.
Notices or communications to or from the CSC Representative shall constitute
notice to or from each of the CSC Securityholders.



(d) No Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, the CSC
Representative shall not be liable to any CSC Securityholder for any act done
or omitted under this Agreement or under the Escrow Agreement as the CSC
Representative while acting in good faith and any act done or omitted pursuant
to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
the CSC Representative be liable under this Agreement or any CSC Documents to
CSC Securityholders for special, indirect, punitive or consequential loss or
damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, lost profits),
regardless of whether or not any such damages were foreseeable or contemplated
and even if the CSC Representative has been advised of the likelihood of such
loss or damage. Each CSC Securityholder, severally and not jointly in
accordance with his, her or its Pro Rata Portion, shall indemnify the CSC
Representative and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the CSC
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement. To the
extent that any distributions of the Escrow Amount are being made to the CSC
Securityholders pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the CSC
Representative may receive reimbursement from the CSC Securityholders (i)
directly out of any such distributions that are being made to the CSC
Securityholders or (ii) directly from the CSC Securityholders (with each CSC
Securityholder severally but not jointly liable in accordance with his, her or
its Pro Rata Portion) for any and all expenses, charges and liabilities,
including attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred by the CSC Representative in
the performance or discharge of his rights and obligations under this
Agreement; provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Company
shall have any liability with respect to such items. No provision of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall require the CSC
Representative to expend or risk his own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of his powers,
rights, duties or privileges under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
CSC Document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the
CSC Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the CSC
Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in
its determination, are sufficient to protect the CSC Representative against
the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the CSC
Representative in performing such actions.



(e) Notice. Any notice or communication given or received by, and any
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the CSC
Representative shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the CSC
Securityholder and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such CSC
Securityholder; and each Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon any such notice, communication, decision, action,
failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice or communication to or
by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every
such CSC Securityholder. Each Parent Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent
are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them
in accordance with any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure
to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of the CSC Representative.

hereto is entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction.

rights under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent or any third party that

the outstanding stock of Parent, whether by sale, consolidation, merger or
otherwise; provided that the assignee assumes all of the obligations of Parent
hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of

CSC and the CSC Representative concurrently herewith, constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the matters covered hereby and

with respect to such matters.



SECTION 10.08 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may only be amended
or modified in a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of such
amendment or modification is sought.



SECTION 10.09 Public Announcement. Except as may otherwise be required by Law
or requirements of any national securities exchange on which Parent Common
Stock is quoted or listed, prior to the Closing, neither CSC, the CSC
Representative nor the CSC Stockholders shall issue any press release or
otherwise make any public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the
Transactions or any dealings between or among the parties in connection with
the subject matter hereof without the prior written approval of Parent. In the
event that any such press release or other public disclosure shall be required
by Law or applicable Exchange requirements, the party required to make such
release or disclosure shall consult with Parent, with respect to the form and
substance of such release or disclosure prior to the public dissemination
thereof if time permits and if such consultation is permitted by Law.



SECTION 10.10 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the
party against whom enforcement is sought. For purposes of this Section 10.10,
the CSC Securityholders are deemed to have agreed that any amendment of this
Agreement signed by the CSC Representative shall be binding upon and effective
against the CSC Securityholders whether or not they have signed such
amendment.





SECTION 10.11 Disclosures Generally. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

information and disclosures contained in any CSC Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other CSC
Disclosure Schedule as though fully set forth in such CSC Disclosure Schedule
for which applicability of such information and disclosure is reasonably
apparent on its face. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in
any CSC Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information
and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for
interpreting the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or other
similar terms in this Agreement.



SECTION 10.12 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on
the one hand, and CSC, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed,

party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. For
purposes of this Section 10.11, the CSC Stockholders are deemed to have agreed
that any extension or waiver signed by the CSC Representative shall be binding
upon and effective against all CSC Stockholders whether or not they have
signed such extension or waiver.



SECTION 10.13 Severability. The invalidity of any portion hereof shall not
affect the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions hereof. If it
is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to permit enforcement
of such restriction to its fullest extent, such restriction shall be enforced
to the maximum extent permitted by Law.



SECTION 10.14 Joint Negotiation and Drafting. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the
agreements ancillary hereto and, in the event that an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement and the agreements ancillary
hereto shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto or thereto
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or of any
of the agreements ancillary hereto.



SECTION 10.15 Schedules. All references herein to schedules refer to the CSC
Disclosure Schedules unless otherwise specified.



SECTION 10.16 Specific Performance and Other Remedies.



(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the other party or parties hereto of any covenant,
obligation or other agreement set forth in this Agreement, (i) each party
shall be entitled, without any proof of actual damages (and in addition to any
other remedy that may be available to it), to a decree or order of specific
performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant, obligation or other agreement and an injunction preventing or
restraining such breach or threatened breach, and (ii) no party hereto shall
be required to provide or post any bond or other security or collateral in
connection with any such decree, order or injunction or in connection with any
related action or legal proceeding.



(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred herein upon a party hereto
shall be deemed to be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or in equity upon such party, and the exercise by
a party hereto of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

_________________, 2014, by and among NeoStem, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), California Stem Cell, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CSC"), Jason
Livingston, solely in his capacity as the stockholders representative (the
"CSC Representative"), and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New
York corporation (the "Escrow Agent").



RECITALS



WHEREAS, Parent, NBS Acquistion Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Subco"), NBS Acquisition Sub II, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("Subco II"), CSC and the CSC Representative have entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of April 11, 2014 (the "Merger Agreement"),
pursuant to which, among other things, (a) Subco will merge with and into the
CSC (the "First Merger"), with CSC surviving the First Merger, and (b) as soon
as practicable thereafter, CSC, as the surviving company of the First Merger,
will merge with and into Subco II (the "Second Merger" and together with the
First Merger, the "Mergers"), with Subco II surviving the Second Merger as the
Surviving Company;



WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement contemplates the establishment of an Escrow
Account for the deposit by Parent of a portion of the Merger Consideration to
be held in escrow until the Termination Date, and to be subsequently released
and distributed to the CSC Representative for distribution to the CSC
Securityholders; and



WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 8.06 of the Merger Agreement, Jason Livingston
has been irrevocably appointed by the CSC Securityholders to serve as the CSC
Representative in connection with all matters under this Agreement and the
Merger Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and undertakings
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto,
intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:



Section 1. Defined Terms.



1.1 Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined in this Agreement
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.



1.2 As used in this Agreement, "Escrowed Shares" refers to the [ ] shares of
Parent Common Stock being issued and deposited into the Escrow Account
pursuant to Sections 3.04(b)(iv) and (vi) of the Merger Agreement.



Section 2. Escrow and Indemnification.



2.1 Appointment of Escrow Agent; Shares and Stock Powers Placed in Escrow.
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company is hereby appointed to serve as
Escrow Agent hereunder, and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company hereby
agrees to serve as Escrow Agent hereunder. In accordance with the terms,
conditions and procedures of Sections 3.04, 3.05 and 8.05 of the Merger
Agreement, promptly at or immediately following the First Effective Time, (a)
Parent shall issue certificates for the Escrowed Shares registered in the name
of the Escrow Agent evidencing [ ] shares of Parent Common Stock to be held in
escrow under this Agreement, and shall deliver or cause such certificates to
be delivered to the Escrow Agent, and (b) the CSC Representative shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent an "assignment separate from certificate" ("Stock Power")
endorsed by him in blank.



2.2 Escrow Account. The Escrow Agent agrees to accept delivery of the Escrowed
Shares and to hold the Escrowed Shares in a separate escrow account (such
account, the "Escrow Account"), subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement.



2.3 Voting of Escrow Shares. The Escrow Agent, as record owner of the Escrowed
Shares, shall exercise all voting rights with respect to such Escrowed Shares
in accordance with Section 3.05 of the Merger Agreement, upon receipt of
written instructions from the CSC Representative. In the absence of such
instructions, the Escrow Agent shall vote the Escrowed Shares as directed by
Parent. The Escrow Agent shall deliver to the CSC Representative any proxy
materials or other documents relating to the Escrowed Shares received from
time to time by the Escrow Agent from Parent but shall not be obligated to
distribute such documents to the CSC Securityholders.



2.4 Reports. Upon the request of either Parent or the CSC Representative, the
Escrow Agent shall provide a statement to the requesting party that describes
any deposit, distribution or investment activity or deductions with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow Account in addition to
quarterly account statements from the Escrow Agent.



2.5 Dividends, Etc. Parent and the CSC Representative, on behalf of each of
the CSC Securityholders, agree that any shares of Parent Common Stock or other
property (including ordinary cash dividends) distributable or issuable
(whether by way of dividend, stock split or otherwise) in respect of or in
exchange for any Escrowed Shares (including pursuant to or as a part of a
merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, reorganization or
liquidation involving Parent) shall not be distributed or issued to the
beneficial owners of such Escrowed Shares, but rather shall be distributed or
issued to and held by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account. Any securities
or other property received by the Escrow Agent in respect of any Escrowed
Shares held in escrow as a result of any stock split or combination of shares
of Parent Common Stock, payment of a stock dividend or other stock
distribution in or on shares of Parent Common Stock, or change of Parent
Common Stock into any other securities pursuant to or as a part of a merger,
consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, reorganization or liquidation
involving Parent, or otherwise, shall be held by the Escrow Agent as part of
the Escrow Account.



2.6 Transferability. Except as expressly provided for herein or by operation
of law, the interests of the CSC Securityholders in the Escrow Account shall
not be assignable or transferable.

(i)No Waiver. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power or
remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof
at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto
with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at
variance with the terms hereof, will not constitute a waiver by such party of

demand such compliance.



(j)No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement brought in the
courts referred to above and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not
to plead or claim in any such court that any such action or proceeding brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

JOINDER Agreement

THIS JOINDER AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of [____], 2014 by and
between NeoStem, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and the undersigned
holder of an interest in California Stem Cell, Inc. (the "CSC Interest") set
forth on the signature page hereto (the "CSC Stockholder"). Capitalized terms
used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger
Agreement") dated as of April 11, 2014, by and among Parent, NBS Acquisition
Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Subco"), NBS Acquisition Sub II, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company ("Subco II"), California Stem Cell, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("CSC") and Jason Livingston, solely in his capacity as
the stockholders representative (the "CSC Representative"), (a) Subco will be
merged with and into CSC, (b) as soon as practicable thereafter, CSC will be
merged with and into Subco II (collectively, the "Merger"), and (c) in
connection with the Merger, all of the capital stock and other equity
securities of CSC will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement.

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent, Subco and
Subco II (collectively, the "Parent Parties") to enter into the Merger
Agreement, the Parent Parties have required that each of the CSC Stockholders
enter into this Agreement.

WHEREAS, in order to induce the Parent Parties to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the undersigned
CSC Stockholder is willing to enter into this Agreement.

Now, Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent and CSC Stockholder agree as follows:



1.Representations as to Enforceability of this Agreement and Related Matters.
CSC Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to the Parent Parties as
follows:



(a)Such CSC Stockholder's address set forth on the signature page hereto is
accurate and complete.

(b)CSC Stockholder has duly completed and validly executed the applicable
Investor Questionnaire attached hereto as Exhibit A (CSC Stockholder to check
applicable box):

(i) such CSC Stockholder is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of
Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated by the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act") (which definition is included in the Investor Questionnaire
attached hereto as Exhibit A).

(ii) such CSC Stockholder is not an "accredited investor" within the meaning
of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act.

(c)Such CSC Stockholder has been furnished with, and has had access to, such
information as he, she or it considers necessary or appropriate for deciding
whether to approve the Merger and acquire Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger Agreement, the CSC Disclosure Schedules
and Parent's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the financial
statements filed therewith (which are available at www.sec.gov). Such CSC
Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that neither Parent nor any Person on its
behalf makes any representation or warranty concerning the value of the Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement or any other matter
related to Parent (except for the representations and warranties of Parent in
the Merger Agreement).

(d)CSC Stockholder understands and acknowledges that its, his or her
investment in the shares of Parent Common Stock involves a high degree of risk
and has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice as it, he or she has
considered necessary to make an informed investment decision with respect to
its, his or her acquisition of the shares of Parent Common Stock.

(e)CSC Stockholder is acquiring the Parent Common Stock for investment for
its, his or her own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not with the view
to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof, and CSC
Stockholder has no present intention of Transferring any of such securities in
violation of any applicable securities laws and regulations and has no
contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person regarding the
Transfer of such securities in violation of any applicable securities laws and
regulations.

(f)CSC Stockholder, if it is an entity, has all necessary entity power and
authority or, if such CSC Stockholder is an individual, has the legal
capacity, to enter into this Agreement and any Transaction Documents to which
it, he or she, as the case may be, is a party and to perform its, his or her
covenants and obligations under this Agreement and such Transaction Documents.
If such CSC Stockholder is an entity, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and any Transaction 

Documents to which such CSC Stockholder is a party and the performance by such
CSC Stockholder of its, his or her covenants and obligations under this and
any such Transaction Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary
entity action on the part of such CSC Stockholder and no further action is
required on the part of such CSC Stockholder to authorize this Agreement and
any Transaction Documents to which such CSC Stockholder is a party or the
performance by such CSC Stockholder of its covenants and obligations hereunder
or thereunder. Each of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which
such CSC Stockholder is a party has been duly executed and delivered by such
CSC Stockholder, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
the other parties hereto and thereto, constitute the valid and binding
obligations of such CSC Stockholder, enforceable against such CSC Stockholder
in accordance with their respective terms, subject to laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, the relief of
debtors and enforcement of creditors' rights in general and rules of law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief, other equitable remedies
and other general principles of equity.

(g)CSC Stockholder has no right, title or interest in or to any interest in
the CSC Group other than the CSC Interest and is the sole record and
beneficial owner of the CSC Interest. Such CSC Interest is not subject to any
Liens or to any rights of first refusal of any kind, and such CSC Stockholder
has not granted any rights to purchase such CSC Interest to any other Person,
except as may arise under the Investor Agreements. Such CSC Stockholder has
the sole right to transfer such CSC Interest to Parent, subject to the
Investor Agreements.

(h)The execution and delivery by CSC Stockholder of this Agreement, and the
performance by CSC Stockholder of its, his or her covenants and obligations
hereunder will not, conflict with any provision of the organizational
documents of CSC Stockholder if CSC Stockholder is an entity.

(i)CSC Stockholder has received a copy of the Merger Agreement, CSC Disclosure
Schedules, and Financial Statements and has read and understands the scope and
effect of the provisions thereof and has had the opportunity to discuss the
foregoing with CSC Stockholder's professional advisors to the extent CSC
Stockholder has deemed necessary. Without limiting the foregoing, CSC
Stockholder acknowledges that it has reviewed the representations and
warranties of Parent set forth in Article IV of the Merger Agreement.

(j)CSC Stockholder understands that the Parent Common Stock issued in the
Mergers constitutes "restricted securities" and have not been registered under
the Securities Act or qualified under any applicable state securities law by
reason of their issuance in a transaction that does not require registration
or qualification (based in part on the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Investor contained herein), and that such securities must be
held indefinitely unless a subsequent disposition is registered under the
Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws or is exempt from such
registration. CSC Stockholder hereby agrees that Parent may insert the
following or similar legend on the face of the certificates evidencing the
Parent Common Stock, if required in compliance with federal and state
securities laws:



"THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT") NOR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE.
THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD, OFFERED FOR SALE, OR HYPOTHECATED IN THE ABSENCE OF A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT IN EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SUCH ACT
OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH
REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED PURSUANT TO A VALID EXEMPTION THEREFROM UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT."

(k)The representations and warranties of CSC Stockholder set forth herein are
true and correct on the date hereof, will be true and correct as of the
Effective Time and shall survive such date until the one year anniversary of
the Effective Time.



2.Joinder to the Merger Agreement; Appointment of CSC Representative.



(a)CSC Stockholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that it, he or she is a CSC
Stockholder for all purposes of and under the Merger Agreement and,
accordingly, agrees to be bound by the terms thereof, solely in its, his or
her capacity as such CSC Stockholder and as fully as though CSC Stockholder
were a signatory thereto, including but not limited to being severally and not
jointly liable with respect to the indemnification obligations of the CSC
Stockholders under Article VIII.

(b)CSC Stockholder hereby irrevocably nominates, constitutes and appoints the
CSC Representative as its, his or her true and lawful agent, proxy and
attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, to take such actions as are
permitted under the express terms of the Merger Agreement, and to make any
decisions required or permitted to be taken by the CSC Representative under
the Merger Agreement in accordance with Section 8.7 thereof (including the
right to take any action that the CSC Representative may, in its sole
discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in connection
with any claim for indemnification under Article VIII of the Merger
Agreement).



3.Transfer of Securities. CSC Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly,
(a) sell, pledge, encumber, grant an option with respect to, transfer or
otherwise dispose of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Mergers
or any interest in such shares of Parent Common Stock to any Person, or (b)
enter into an agreement or commitment contemplating the possible sale of,
pledge of, encumbrance of, granting of an option with respect to, transfer of
or other disposition of such shares of Parent 

Common Stock or any interest therein to any Person (i) during the Lock-Up
Period (as defined hereinafter) applicable thereto or (ii) at any point
following the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, except in the case of this

Stock issued to CSC Stockholder in connection with the Transactions may be
sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities
Act, (1) such CSC Stockholder shall have given Parent written notice of such
proposed transfer prior to the time of such transfer, stating the name and
address of the transferee and identifying the securities proposed to be
transferred; (2) if requested by Parent, such CSC Stockholder shall have
furnished to Parent an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
to the effect that such transfer will not require registration of such
securities under the Securities Act; and (3) immediately following such
transfer the further disposition of such securities by such transferee shall
be restricted to the extent required under the Securities Act, (B) on or after
the date on which such shares of Parent Common Stock may be sold without
restriction pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act or (C)
pursuant to an effective registration statement respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock. The term "Lock-Up Period" means, with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued to CSC Stockholder at the Closing, the
period of twelve months commencing on the Closing Date; provided, however,
that the Lock-Up Period shall cease to apply to fifty percent of such shares
of Parent Common Stock on the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date.



4.Confidentiality. CSC Stockholder hereby agrees that all confidential and/or
proprietary information of CSC obtained by CSC Stockholder prior to the

agreements contemplated hereby or documents referenced herein shall be kept
confidential by CSC Stockholder and shall not be used by CSC Stockholder for
any purpose (other than disclosures to managers, advisors or equity holders of
the CSC Stockholder on a need to know basis in connection with the approval of
the Merger Agreement and who are bound by similar obligations of
confidentiality, if applicable); provided, however, that (a) CSC Stockholder
may disclose such information or terms if required to do so by applicable Law,
provided that CSC Stockholder promptly notifies Parent (in advance, to the
extent reasonably practicable) of disclosing such information and takes
reasonable steps to minimize the extent of any such required disclosure; (b)
if CSC Stockholder is an investment fund, CSC Stockholder may disclose the
terms of the Joinder Agreement and the Merger Agreement to its limited

prospective investors who agree to keep such terms confidential; (c) following
any public announcement of the Merger by Parent, CSC Stockholder may disclose
the terms of the Merger Agreement that are disclosed by Parent in such public
announcement; (d) CSC Stockholder may disclose such information or terms to
the extent they become generally available to the public other than by virtue
of a breach of this provision by such CSC Stockholder or its Affiliates; and

and his, her or its Affiliates' respective professional advisers and, if CSC
Stockholder is not a natural person, to its employees or the employees of its
Affiliates, in each case, who: (i) need to know such information; and (ii)
agree to keep it confidential. CSC Stockholder shall be responsible for any
action taken by his, her or its Affiliates and its and their respective
professional advisers and employees that, if such action had been taken by CSC
Stockholder, would have constituted a breach of this Section 4.



5.Waiver and Release; Termination of CSC Interest.



Effective upon the Closing, the undersigned hereby irrevocably waives,
releases and discharges Parent, Merger Sub, each Person in the CSC Group, the
Surviving Entity and each of their Subsidiaries from any and all obligations
and liabilities to the undersigned of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether
in its capacity as a stockholder, member, employee, manager, officer or
director of any Person in the CSC Group (including, without limitation, in
respect of rights of contribution or indemnification) as to facts, conditions,
transactions, events or circumstances on or prior to the First Effective Time,
and the undersigned shall not seek to recover any amounts in connection
therewith or thereunder from Parent, Merger Sub, each Person in the CSC Group,
the Surviving Entity and/or any of their Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
this Section 4(a) is not intended to affect any rights any of the parties
hereto may have under the Merger Agreement or under any other Contract that
the undersigned may have with Parent, Merger Sub, each Person in the CSC
Group, the Surviving Entity relating to the continued employment by any of
those entities, or the engagement by any of those entities as a consultant, of
the undersigned in each case following the First Effective Time.



(a)The undersigned (i) represents, warrants and acknowledges that the
undersigned has been fully advised by the undersigned's attorney of the
contents of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California and (ii)
hereby expressly waives the benefits thereof and any rights that the
undersigned may have thereunder. Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State
of California provides as follows: "A general release does not extend to
claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at
the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
affected his settlement with the debtor."

(b)CSC Stockholder agrees that, upon the First Effective Time, such CSC
Stockholder forfeits and relinquishes any right, title or interest in or to
such CSC Stockholder's CSC Interest.



1.Miscellaneous. 



(a)Effectiveness. This Agreement will only be effective upon the occurrence of
the Closing. In the event the Closing does not occur (including as a result of
the termination of the Merger Agreement), this Agreement shall be null and
void and of no further force or effect. No amendment of this Agreement shall
be effective unless in writing signed by Parent and CSC Stockholder.

(b)Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be made and given in
compliance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement.

(c)Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties
need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement
(in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission or facsimile shall
be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

(d)Third Party Beneficiaries. CSC, the Surviving Company, the CSC
Representative and each of the other CSC Stockholders are intended third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall be entitled to enforce this
Agreement against the undersigned in accordance with its terms.

(e)Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement, the Transaction Documents,
the exhibits and schedules thereto, and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto and thereto referenced herein and
therein: (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof; (ii) other than the third party beneficiaries
referenced in Section 5(d), are not intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies hereunder; and (iii) shall not be assigned by operation
of law or otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder or thereunder to its Affiliates as long as Parent
remains ultimately liable for all of Parent's obligations hereunder and
thereunder.

(f)Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

(g)Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

(h)Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other matters contemplated herein (or, only if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware). Each party
agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related hereto except in such
Court of Chancery (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in any federal court
within the State of Delaware). By execution and delivery of this Agreement,
each party hereto and the CSC Stockholders irrevocably and unconditionally
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and to the appellate
courts therefrom solely for the purposes of disputes arising under the this
Agreement and not as a general submission to such jurisdiction or with respect
to any other dispute, matter or claim whatsoever. The parties hereto
irrevocably consent to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned
courts in any such action or proceeding by the delivery of copies thereof by
overnight courier to the address for such party to which notices are
deliverable hereunder. Any such service of process shall be effective upon
delivery. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve process in any other
manner permitted by applicable law. The parties hereto hereby waive any right
to stay or dismiss any action or proceeding under or in connection with this
Agreement brought before the foregoing courts on the basis of (i) any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts for any reason, or that it or any of its property is immune from the
above-described legal process, (ii) that such action or proceeding is brought
in an inconvenient forum, that venue for the action or proceeding is improper
or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts, or (iii) any
other defense that would hinder or delay the levy, execution or collection of
any amount to which any party hereto is entitled pursuant to any final
judgment of any court having jurisdiction.

(i)Legal Counsel. The parties hereto acknowledge that Lowenstein Sandler LLP
("LS") has represented Parent and KandL Gates LLP ("KandL Gates") has represented
CSC, in each case in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the
Transactions, and neither LS nor KandL Gates has undertaken to represent any
other party in connection herewith or therewith.

Investor Questionnaire

This confidential Investor Questionnaire (this "Questionnaire") must be
completed by each CSC Stockholder in connection with the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the "Securities"). Any CSC
Stockholder who is not able to complete this Questionnaire and certify that
he, she or it qualifies as an "accredited investor" as defined under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), will not be eligible to
receive Securities pursuant to the Merger. The Securities will be issued by
Parent in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without
registration under the Act and the securities laws of certain states, in
reliance on the exemptions contained in Section 4(2) of the Act and/or on
Regulation D promulgated thereunder and in reliance on similar exemptions
under applicable state laws. Parent must determine that each CSC Stockholder
meets certain suitability requirements before offering or selling Securities
to such CSC Stockholder and will use this Questionnaire to determinate whether
such investor will meet the applicable suitability requirements. The
information supplied by you will be used in determining whether you meet such
criteria, and reliance upon the private offering exemptions from registration
is based in part on the information herein supplied.

This Questionnaire does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of
an offer to buy any security. Your answers will be kept strictly confidential.
However, by signing this Questionnaire, you will be authorizing Parent to
provide a completed copy of this Questionnaire to such parties as Parent deems
appropriate in order to ensure that the offer and sale of the Securities will
not result in a violation of the Act or the securities laws of any state and
that you otherwise satisfy the suitability standards applicable to acquirors
of the Securities. All potential investors must answer all applicable
questions and complete, date and sign this Questionnaire. Please print or type
your responses and attach additional sheets of paper if necessary to complete
your answers to any item.

_____ (7) an entity in which all of the equity owners are accredited investors
(as defined above).

As used in this Questionnaire, the term "net worth" means the excess of total
assets over total liabilities. In computing net worth for the purpose of
subsection (4) above, the value of the principal residence of the investor
must be excluded, provided, however, that if the amount of mortgage or other
indebtedness secured by the investor's primary residence exceeds the value of
the residence and the lender has other recourse against the investor, the
excess must be deducted from the investor's net worth. In determining income,
the investor should add to the investor's adjusted gross income any amounts
attributable to tax exempt income received, losses claimed as a limited
partner in any limited partnership, contributions to an IRA or KEOGH
retirement plan, alimony payments, and any amount by which income from long-
term capital gains has been reduced in arriving at adjusted gross income.
