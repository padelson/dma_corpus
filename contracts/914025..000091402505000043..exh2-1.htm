the  Company and Edward Anchel shall fully cooperate with Parent and
Parent's  environmental consultant to assist in execution by the Parent of

response under, any applicable Environmental  Law, and (iii) if found in
either surface water or ground water, is not  attributable to the use of the
Pennsylvania Properties by the Company and its  existence is not known to
Edward Anchel or the Company prior to the date of  this  Agreement. In all
other instances, the Company shall reimburse Parent the costs  of preparing
and executing the Evaluation Plan. Parent shall indemnify and  hold 
harmless the Company and Edward Anchel against any Unreasonable
Interference,  and Parent shall further indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and Edward  Anchel against any losses or liability caused by
exacerbating, through negligent  execution of the Evaluation Plan, any
contamination of the environment existing  before execution of the Evaluation
Plan at either of the Pennsylvania  Properties. The mere discovery of
contamination of the environment at either  of  the Pennsylvania Properties
shall not, by itself, be deemed to require Parent  to  indemnify and hold
the Company and Edward Anchel harmless under the indemnity  given Company and
Edward Anchel in this Section 6.10. For the purposes of any  execution of the
Evaluation Plan pursuant to this Section 6.10, the term "Unreasonable

pipeline, septic system, wire, natural gas supply, or underground  conveyance
at any of the Pennsylvania Properties, without regard to fault,  and  (ii)
any closure, relocation, or suspension of any business of the Company  on 
either of the Pennsylvania Properties to which the Company has not given its 
prior consent, which is not to be unreasonably withheld, during either 
preparation or execution of the Evaluation Plan by Parent or Parent's 
environmental consultant.

warranties of Company contained in this Agreement shall  be true and correct
when made and as of the Closing (except where the failure  of  a
representation or warranty to be so true and correct would not be reasonably 
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or the ability of 
Parent, or the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated in this 
Agreement), with the same force and effect as if made as of the Closing, (it 
being understood, that for purposes of determining the accuracy of such 
representations and warranties, (a) all " _Material  Adverse Effect_ "

Agreement).

_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the payoff amounts set forth in such
letters shall anticipate the Company's  payment of available cash to such
lenders to reduce the amount of the Company  Debt Obligations.

executed notice in a form reasonably  acceptable to Parent for purposes of

be  in  full force and effect, except where the failure to obtain such
consents:  (a) was not due to breach of the Company of their obligations to
obtain  such consents under the standard outlined by Section 6.4;  and  (b)
would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect  on the 
ability of Parent or the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated 
by  this Agreement.

not have been commenced against Parent,  or against any Person affiliated

Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction  seeking to (a) enjoin, restrain
or otherwise prohibit the consummation  of  the transactions contemplated
hereby; (b) impose criminal penalties  in  connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby; or  (c) impose a Material Adverse

warranties of Parent contained in this Agreement shall  be true and correct
when made and as of the Closing (except where the failure  of  a

Parent,  or  the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement),  with  the same force and effect as if made as of the Closing

consents:  (a) was not due to breach of the Parent of its obligation to
cooperate  with  the Company to obtain such consents under the standard
outlined by the last  sentence of Section 7.2;  and  (b) would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect  on the  Parent or a
Material Adverse Effect on the ability of Parent or the Company  to 
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

follows:

 

 

(a) by  either  Parent or the Company if a material breach of any provision
of this Agreement  has been committed by the other party and such breach has
not been waived,  _provided_   that  written notice has been given to the
other party of the intention to terminate  under this Section 9.1(a)  due
to  such breach and the other party has not cured such breach within 30 days
of  receipt of such notice, or if such breach is unable to be cured within
such  30-day period, the breaching party has made commercially reasonable
efforts  to  cure such breach and such breach is cured not later that 60
days after notice  thereof;

 

 

(b) (i)by  Parent  if any of the conditions in Article VII  have not  been
satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of such a condition  is 
or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Parent to comply
with  its obligations under this Agreement) and Parent has not waived such
condition  on or before the Closing Date;

 

 

(ii) by  the  Company, if any of the conditions in Article VIII  have not 
been satisfied as of the Closing Date or if satisfaction of such a condition 
is  or becomes impossible (other

 

 

(iii) than  through the failure of the Company to comply with their
obligations under this  Agreement) and the Company has not waived such
condition on or before the  Closing Date;

 

 

_provided _ that  in  each case written notice has been given to the other
party of the intention  to  terminate under this Section 9.1(b)  for

(d) by  mutual  written consent of Parent and the Company; or

 

 

(e) by  either  Parent or the Company if the Closing has not occurred (other
than through the  failure of any party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
comply fully with  its obligations under this Agreement) on or before the
date that is three (3)  months following the date of this Agreement (which
date shall be extended to  the  date that is five (5) months following the
date of this Agreement if the  transactions contemplated hereby shall not
have been consummated as a result  of  a failure to satisfy the conditions
set forth in Section 7.8),  or  such later date as the parties may agree
upon.

**9.2** **Effect  of Termination**.  Each  party's right of termination
under Section 9.1  is in  addition to any other rights it may have under
this Agreement or otherwise,  and  the exercise of a right of termination
will not be an election of remedies.  If  this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1,  all  further obligations of the parties under this
Agreement will terminate, except  that the provisions of Article XII  will 
survive after such termination; _provided_   that if  this Agreement is
terminated by a party because of the breach of the Agreement  by the other
party or because one or more of the conditions to the terminating  party's
obligations under this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the  other
party's failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the 
terminating party's right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such 
termination unimpaired for a period of six months after such  termination.

**11.3** **Limitations**

 

 

(a) No  claims  for breaches of representations, warranties, covenants or

(b) The  indemnity, defense, and hold harmless obligations of Majority
Shareholders  and  Minority Shareholders set forth in Section 11.1 above
which may arise for a  breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company or any Subsidiary  under Section 3.17 of this Agreement (i) shall
also extend to any Damages  arising out of the continuation, from before the
Closing Date to after the  Closing Date, of any circumstance which violates
such Section, and shall extend  after the Closing Date only to the date on
which the continuation has been  discovered by

 

 

(c) Parent,  or with reasonable diligence should have been discovered by
Parent, and Parent  has had a reasonable time to correct the condition
presented by such  continuation (the "Continued Condition Termination Date").
If any such  continuing condition results in an adverse health effect to an
individual  exposed before the Closing Date, by the Company or any
Subsidiary, to a  Hazardous Material stored, used, disposed of, released,
generated, or  transported by the Company or any Subsidiary, the liability
for the adverse  health effect shall be allocated between the Parent and the
Company (or its  Subsidiary) based on the length of the exposure of such
individual from the  point in time before the Closing Date when such exposure
is deemed to have  began  to the Continued Condition Termination Date, and
such other factors as either  party can prove which may be relevant to the
degree and duration of the  exposure.

 

 

**11.4** **Procedures  for Indemnification -- Third Party Claims**

 

 

 

(a) Promptly  after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 11.1 
or 11.2  of  notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such
indemnified party  will, if a claim is to be made against an indemnifying
party under such Section,  give written notice to the indemnifying party of
the commencement of such claim,  but the failure to notify the indemnifying
party will not relieve the  indemnifying party of any liability that it may
have to any indemnified party,  except to the extent that the indemnifying
party demonstrates that the defense  of such action is prejudiced by the
indemnifying party's failure to give such  notice.

 

 

(b) If  any  Proceeding referred to in Section 11.4(a)  is  brought
against an indemnified party and it gives written notice to the  indemnifying
party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the indemnifying  party will be
entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent  that  it
wishes (unless the indemnifying party is also a party to such Proceeding 
and  the indemnified party determines in good faith that joint representation
would  be inappropriate), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with
counsel  reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and, after notice
from the  indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to
assume the  defense of such Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as
long as it  diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified
party under  this Article XI  for any  fees of other counsel or any other
expenses with respect to the defense of  such  Proceeding, in each case
subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in  connection with the
defense of such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs  of  investigation.
If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a  Proceeding:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-48-  

 

 

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

(i) it  will  be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement
that the claims  made  in that Proceeding are within the scope of and
subject to  indemnification;

 

 

(ii) no  compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the
indemnifying  party without the indemnified party's consent unless: (A) there
is no  finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any
violation  of  the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims
that may be made  against the indemnified party, and (B) the sole relief
provided is monetary  damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying
party; and

 

 

(iii) the  indemnified party will have no liability with respect to any
compromise or  settlement of such claims effected without its consent, other
than reasonable,  documented costs of investigation.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, if (i) the indemnifying party does not,
within ten Business  Days after the indemnified party's notice is given
pursuant to this  Section 11.4,  give  written notice to the indemnified
party of its election to assume the defense  of  such Proceeding as
permitted under Section 11.4(b),  or  (ii) the indemnified party determines
in good faith that there is a  reasonable probability that a Proceeding may
adversely affect it or its  affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be  entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, then in either case the  indemnified party may, by notice to the
indemnifying party, assume the exclusive  right to defend, compromise, or
settle such Proceeding, but the indemnifying  party will not be bound by any
determination of a Proceeding so defended or  any  compromise or settlement
effected without its consent unless such determination,  compromise or
settlement: (A) results in no finding or admission of  any  violation of
Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person  and  no
effect on any other claims that may be made against the indemnifying party, 
and (B) does not obligate the indemnifying party to pay monetary  damages.

 

 

**11.5** **Procedure  for Indemnification -- Other Claims**

 

 

.  A claim  for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party
claim may be  asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is 
sought.

 

 

**11.6** **Exclusive  Remedy**

 

 

.  Parent,  the Majority Shareholders and the Minority Shareholders herby
agree that, after  the Closing, the rights and remedies of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation,  the Majority Shareholders and the Minority
Shareholders contained in this Article XI  to  recover Damages (subject to
the limitations set forth herein) shall be the  sole  and exclusive rights
and remedies that they shall have against Parent or any  Majority Shareholder
or Minority Shareholder, as applicable, arising out of,  relating to or
resulting from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated  hereby,
except in the case of fraud, with respect to which the limitations  set 
forth in this Section 11.6  shall  not apply.

seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right  arising out of,
this Agreement may be brought against any of the parties in  the  courts of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, County of Philadelphia, or, if  it  has or

Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and each of the parties consents to the 
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any 
such action or proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein.

purpose  of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the documents
referred to  in  this Agreement.

Agreement are cumulative and not  alternative. Neither the failure nor any
delay by any party in exercising any  right, power, or privilege under this
Agreement or the documents referred to  in  this Agreement will operate as a
waiver of such right, power, or privilege,  and  no single or partial
exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will  preclude any other or
further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or  the  exercise of any
other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent  permitted by
applicable law: (a) no claim or right arising out of this  Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged  by  one party, in
whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or  right unless
in writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that  may  be given by a
party will be applicable except in the specific instance for  which  it is
given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed  to  be a
waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving 
such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as 
provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this  Agreement.
