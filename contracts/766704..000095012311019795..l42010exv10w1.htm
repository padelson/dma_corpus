 **EXECUTION**

  

EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

   

 EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of February 28, 2011, is made and entered into by and among Health Care REIT, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Buyer_ "), FC-GEN Investment, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Seller_ "), and FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _OpCo_ "). 

   

 WHEREAS, Seller is owner, beneficially and of record, of all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests (the " _Membership Interests_ ") of FC-GEN Acquisition Holding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_ "); 

   

 WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, all of the Membership Interests of the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and 

   

 WHEREAS, prior to the Closing, the Company will effect the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE I 

   

 _PURCHASE AND SALE; PURCHASE PRICE_  

  

 Section 1.1 _Purchase and Sale of Membership Interests_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Seller shall sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, the Membership Interests, free and clear of all Encumbrances. 

   

 Section 1.2 _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, 

   

 (a) " _Actual Net Prorations_ " means (i) all Impositions imposed upon or assessed against the Real Property to the extent attributable to periods prior to, and unpaid as of, 12:01 a.m. local time on the Closing Date, _minus_ (ii) all Prorated Assets with respect to the Real Property as of 12:01 a.m. local time on the Closing Date. To the extent the Actual Net Prorations amount is positive, such amount shall be deducted from the Closing Consideration and to the extent the Actual Net Prorations amount is negative, such amount shall be added to the Closing Consideration. 

   

 (b) " _Closing Date Debt_ " means all Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Indebtedness that is assumed by OpCo and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement) as of immediately prior to the Closing determined on a consolidated basis (including all prepayment or other penalties, yield maintenance expenses, premiums, accrued interest, fees and other amounts due with respect thereto as of the Closing Date and which have not been paid as of the Closing). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) " _Closing Consideration_ " means (A) $2,400,000,000, _plus_ (B) an amount equal to the Cash and Cash Equivalents held by the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding any Cash and Cash Equivalents that is transferred to OpCo and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement) as of the Closing Date, _minus_ (C) Closing Date Debt, _minus_ (D) the Company Transaction Cost Amount, _plus_ / _minus_ (as applicable) (E) the Actual Net Prorations. 

   

 Section 1.3 _Determination of Estimated Closing Consideration_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written calculation (the " _Price Calculation_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail Sellers estimate of the Closing Consideration (the " _Estimated Closing Consideration_ ") and the components thereof, including an estimate of Actual Net Prorations (" _Estimated Net Prorations_ ") and the Closing Payment Amount. Such Price Calculation shall be prepared in good faith by Seller. Seller shall cause the Company to provide Buyer with reasonable access to the books and records of the Company, and other Company documents, to verify the information set forth in the Price Calculation prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 Section 1.4 _Post-Closing Adjustments_. 

   

 (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, OpCo shall: 

    

 (i) prepare, in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles and in good faith, a balance sheet with respect to the Company as of the close of business on the last Business Day preceding the Closing Date (the " _Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet_ "); 

   

 (ii) determine the amount of the Closing Consideration (the " _Preliminary Closing Consideration_ ") and each component thereof in reasonable detail in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; and 

   

 (iii) deliver to Buyer the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and a calculation of the Preliminary Closing Consideration (the " _Preliminary Accounting Report_ "). 

  

 (b) Following receipt of the Preliminary Accounting Report, Buyer may review the same and, within forty-five (45) days after the date of such receipt (the " _Notice Period_ "), may deliver to Seller written notice setting forth its objections (if any) to the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the computation of the Preliminary Closing Consideration as set forth in the Preliminary Accounting Report, together with a summary of the reasons therefor and calculations which, in its view, are necessary to eliminate such objections. In the event Buyer does not object to the Preliminary Closing Consideration within the Notice Period, the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Consideration set forth in the Preliminary Accounting Report shall be final and binding as the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ " and the Closing Consideration, 

     ##### 

  

  

 respectively, for purposes of this Agreement but, subject to Section 9.7,
shall not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

    

 (c) In the event Buyer so objects to the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet or the Preliminary Closing Consideration within the Notice Period, Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to resolve by written agreement (the " _Agreed Adjustments_ ") any differences properly set forth in such notice as to the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Consideration and, in the event Buyer and Seller so resolve all such differences, the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Consideration set forth in the Preliminary Accounting Report as adjusted by the Agreed Adjustments shall be final and binding as the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Consideration, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement but, subject to Section 9.7, shall not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. 

   

 (d) In the event any objections raised by Buyer are not resolved by Agreed Adjustments within the thirty (30) day period next following the delivery of any objections notice by Buyer pursuant to Section 1.4(b), then Buyer and Seller shall submit the objections that are then unresolved to PricewaterhouseCooopers LLP or another national accounting firm acceptable to both Buyer and Seller (the " _Accounting Firm_ "), and such firm shall be directed by Buyer and Seller to resolve the unresolved objections (based solely on the presentations by Buyer and Seller as to whether any disputed matter had been determined in a manner consistent with the Agreed Accounting Principles and this Agreement) as promptly as reasonably practicable and to deliver written notice to each of Buyer and Seller setting forth its resolution of the disputed matters. The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Consideration, after giving effect to any Agreed Adjustments and to the resolution of disputed matters by the Accounting Firm, shall be final and binding as the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Consideration, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement but, subject to Section 9.7, shall not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. 

   

 (e) The parties hereto shall make available to Buyer, Buyers accountants, Seller, Sellers accountants and, if applicable, the Accounting Firm such books, records and other information (including work papers) as any of the foregoing may reasonably request to prepare, review or analyze the Preliminary Accounting Report or any matters submitted to the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.4. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, in proportion to the amount unsuccessfully disputed by each party (as determined by the Accounting Firm) as a fraction of the total amount in dispute. 

   

 Section 1.5 _Payment of the Adjustment_. Promptly, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days, following the final determination of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4(b), Section 1.4(c) or Section 1.4(d), the following shall occur: 

    ##### 

  

  

 (a) If the Estimated Closing Consideration exceeds the Closing Consideration by an amount (such excess, the " _Overestimate_ ") that is greater than the Indemnity Escrow Amount, then Buyer shall be entitled to be paid the entire Indemnity Escrow Amount from the Escrow Account (as defined below) in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and (ii) Buyer shall be entitled to be paid the amount in cash, if any, by which the Overestimate exceeds the Indemnity Escrow Amount from OpCo by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

   

 (b) If the Overestimate is greater than zero but less than the Indemnity Escrow Amount, then Buyer shall be entitled to be paid from the Escrow Account an amount in cash equal to the Overestimate. 

   

 (c) If the Closing Consideration exceeds the Estimated Closing Consideration (the amount by which the Closing Consideration exceeds the Estimated Closing Consideration being referred to herein as the " _Underestimate_ "), then Buyer shall pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal to the Underestimate. 

   

 Section 1.6 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer and Seller shall agree ten (10) days prior to Closing regarding any amounts to be deducted or withheld from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Seller under the Code, or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law. To the extent the amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority by Buyer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to Seller. 

   

 Section 1.7 _Valuation Opinion_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to receive from the Valuation Firm an opinion designated as "final" by Seller with respect to the fair market valuation of OpCo as of the Closing Date determined on a marketable controlling-interest basis (the " _Closing Date Valuation Opinion_ "). The parties hereto agree that the aggregate fair market value of the Equity Interests in OpCo, at the time of the transfer of such Equity Interests pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, for U.S. federal and applicable state income Tax purposes, shall be equal to (i) if the Closing Date Valuation Opinion provides a specific fair market value of such Equity Interests, such fair market value or (ii) as specified by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Buyer. The parties agree that they shall not, and shall not permit their Affiliates to, take a position on any Tax Return that is inconsistent with such determination.

ARTICLE V 

   

 _ACTIONS PRIOR TO CLOSING DATE_  

 

 The respective parties hereto covenant and agree to take the following actions between the date hereof and the Closing Date:

  

 Section 5.1 _Access to Information_. Subject to compliance by Buyer with its obligation under Section 11.2, Seller shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to afford to the officers, employees and authorized representatives of Buyer (including independent public accountants, financial advisors, environmental consultants and attorneys) reasonable access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to the offices, properties, appropriate employees and business and financial records of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent Buyer shall reasonably deem necessary or desirable and shall furnish to Buyer or its authorized representatives such additional information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries as shall be reasonably requested, including all such information as shall be necessary to enable Buyer or its representatives to verify the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in this

    ##### 

  

     

Agreement, to verify that the covenants of Seller contained in this Agreement
have been complied with and to determine whether the conditions set forth in
Article VII have been satisfied;  _provided_ , _however_ , that after
consultation with Buyer, the Company may restrict access and provision of
information to the extent the Company reasonably believes (after consultation
with counsel) necessary to (a) comply with existing confidentiality agreements
with third parties, or (b) preserve legal privilege that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries otherwise would be entitled to assert, if the Company
reasonably believes (after consultation with counsel) that undermining such
privilege would materially and adversely affect the Companys position in any
pending, or what the Company believes in good faith (after consultation
with counsel) is likely to be future, litigation. Buyer agrees that such
investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as to not interfere
unreasonably with the normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
No investigation made by Buyer or its representatives hereunder shall affect
the representations and warranties of Seller hereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Buyer nor any of its representatives, in connection
with a Phase I environmental assessment, shall undertake any sampling of
environmental media or building materials without the prior written consent
of Seller. 

  

 Section 5.2 _Preserve Accuracy of Representations and Warranties_. Each of the parties hereto shall refrain from taking any action that would be reasonably likely to render any representation or warranty of such party contained in Article III or Article IV inaccurate as of the Closing. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of any Action that shall be instituted or threatened against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality, validity or fairness of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of (a) any Action that may be threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would have been listed on  _Schedule 3.12_ if such lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation had arisen prior to the date hereof and (b) any other event or matter that becomes known to the Company and would cause any other representation or warranty of Seller contained in Article III to be untrue in any material respect.

  

 Section 5.3 _Consents of Third Parties; Governmental Approvals_. Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, before the Closing, the consent, approval or waiver (a) from any party to any Contract set forth on _Schedule 3.1(e)_ or otherwise to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) from any Governmental Body required to be obtained to permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to otherwise satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.4 and Section 8.3; _provided_ that (i) with respect to clause (a), neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any obligation to offer or pay any consideration in order to obtain any such consents, approvals or waivers, except to the extent Buyer determines to assume any Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to cause such Indebtedness to remain outstanding following the Closing, in which case Buyer shall be obligated to pay any consideration in order to obtain any such consent related to the assumption of such Indebtedness or causing such Indebtedness to remain outstanding following the Closing, and (ii) with respect to both clauses (a) and (b), Seller shall not make any agreement or understanding affecting the assets or business of the PropCo Entities as a condition for obtaining any such consents or waivers except with the prior written consent of Buyer. During the period after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Seller to obtain the consents, approvals and waivers contemplated by this Section 5.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

    ##### 

  

     

herein, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith and take such actions
as are necessary to obtain, or avoid the need to obtain, the consent of a
landlord of an Excluded Facility, to give effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including through the use of a mutually
agreeable modified structure for the applicable leases and leaving the Lease
Guarantees in place and executing a reaffirmation thereof (if required) as
contemplated by Section 5.16.

 Section 5.6 _No Solicitation_. From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of (i) the Closing or (ii) the effective date of termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article X, except as provided below, Seller agrees that:

  

 (a) Seller shall not, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to, authorize or permit its officers, directors, Affiliates, employees and authorized agents and representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it) to (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to, or the making or implementation of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to, or approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to the Company in connection with, or take any other action to cooperate in any way with respect to, or assist in or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

  

 (b) Seller shall advise Buyer orally and in writing of (i) any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or which could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal received by any officer or director of Seller or the Company or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any financial advisor, attorney, Affiliate or other advisor or representative of Seller or the Company, (ii) the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal (including a copy of any written proposal) and (iii) the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, no later than twenty-four (24) hours following receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

    ##### 

  

     

2010 and audited statements of income and cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries for 2010 (the " _Company Audited 2010 Financial
Statements_ "). If the Closing has not occurred prior to such date, Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered, (i) on or
prior to May 1, 2011, to Buyer, an unaudited consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries at March 31, 2011 and
unaudited statements of income and cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries for the three months ending on March 31, 2011 (the

 Section 5.8 _Payoff Letters_.

Seller shall deliver copies of the Payoff Letters to Buyer not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date.

  

 Section 5.9 _Landlord Estoppels_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure an estoppel certificate, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, from each landlord under the applicable Leased Real Property Lease; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the receipt of any or all such estoppel certificates be a condition to the Closing.

  

 Section 5.10 _Title Insurance Coverage_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyers efforts to cause the title insurance company or companies selected by Buyer to issue, at Buyers cost and expense, a New Title Policy, to the extent such coverage is available in the applicable jurisdiction, such cooperation to include the execution and delivery by Seller of such affidavits, undertakings and similar documents (including "non-imputation" and "survey no-change" affidavits) as are reasonably necessary for Buyer to receive the New Title Policy, such affidavits, undertakings and documents to be reasonably acceptable to Seller, qualified by Sellers Knowledge as appropriate and in the customary form used by such title company for transactions similar to those described herein. As used herein, the term " _New Title Policy_ " shall mean an ALTA Owner Policy of Title Insurance or other customary title policy or "date-down" endorsement to an Existing Policy with respect to the applicable Real Property issued by a title insurance company selected by Buyer, in the amount of the fair market value of the applicable Real Property, insuring that the applicable owner has good and insurable fee simple title to, or holds a valid leasehold interest in, such Real

    ##### 

  

     

Property, subject to no Encumbrances other than the Permitted Encumbrances,
containing such endorsements as shall be reasonably requested by Buyer. If a
nationally recognized title company selected by Buyer will not issue New
Title Policies, Seller may require Buyer to accept an alternative nationally
recognized title company for the purpose of obtaining New Title Policies. 

  

 Section 5.11 _Material Damages_. Seller shall promptly give Buyer written notice of any Material Damage (as defined below) to a Facility, describing such damage, stating whether such damage and loss of rents is covered by insurance and the estimated cost and timing of repairing such damage and any injuries to persons or damage to other Persons property, attaching a copy of the relevant insurance policy to such notice. Notwithstanding anything to contrary set forth herein, in the event that any Material Damage occurs after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall be entitled to receive any insurance proceeds (including any rent loss insurance applicable to any period on and after the Closing Date) due the Company as a result of such damage or destruction and assume responsibility for such repair, _provided_ that Buyer shall be entitled to participate in any insurance settlement negotiations relating to such damage or destruction and, to the extent such settlement negotiations continue after the Closing, Seller and/or OpCo shall have the right to participate in such settlement negotiations, _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall reimburse the Company at Closing for any deductible, retention or self insurance amounts or any Loss or Expense that exceeds the applicable insurance coverage (" _Additional Reimbursements_ ") and (i) the Closing Consideration shall not be adjusted as a result of either the Material Damage or the amount of any insurance proceeds or Additional Reimbursements received as a result of such Material Damage, (ii) any rent loss insurance proceeds or Additional Reimbursements received by the Company as a result of such Material Damage shall be included in the transfer of the Equity Interests in OpCo pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, and (iii) Buyer shall cause the Company to make the insurance proceeds (other than the rent loss insurance or Additional Reimbursements related thereto) received with respect to the Material Damage available to the tenant under the Master Lease Agreement and such tenant shall use the same to restore the applicable Facilities subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of the Master Lease Agreement. Buyer may elect to extend the Closing Date for up to an additional thirty (30) day period, without regard to the Outside Date, in an effort to obtain insurance settlement agreements with Sellers insurers, and Seller will cooperate with Buyer in obtaining the insurance proceeds from Sellers insurers. " _Material Damage_ " and " _Materially Damaged_ " means damage to a Facility that, in Buyers reasonable estimation, exceeds $500,000 in the aggregate.

  

 Section 5.12 _Bridge Financing_. Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable in Buyers reasonable judgment to satisfy all conditions and covenants applicable to Buyer in the Bridge Commitment in order to be able to obtain the funds contemplated by the Bridge Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Bridge Commitment (it being understood the commitments under the Bridge Financing may be reduced by the amount of any proceeds obtained by Buyer from any capital markets financing or asset sales). Buyer shall not permit, without Sellers consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under the Bridge Commitment if such amendment, modification or waiver would (a) reduce the aggregate

    ##### 

  

     

amount of the Bridge Financing in any material respect (other than as a result
of any capital markets financing or asset sales) or (b) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions,
to the receipt of the Bridge Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (i) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) make the funding
of the Bridge Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Bridge Financing) less likely to occur in any material respect or (iii)
adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Bridge Commitment in any material respect;  _provided_ ,
_however_ that Buyer may amend the Bridge Commitment and any related
fee letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities (and affiliates thereof) that have not executed the Bridge
Commitment as of the date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to (x) maintain in effect the Bridge Commitment
in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof (and
subject to Buyers ability to undertake capital markets financings or sales
of assets which reduce commitments under the Bridge Commitment), (y) satisfy
all conditions and covenants applicable to Buyer in the Bridge Commitment and
(z) cause the Lenders and other persons providing financing under the Bridge
Financing to fund the Bridge Financing on the Closing Date to the extent
Buyer deems it necessary to draw upon the Bridge Financing on the Closing
Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give
Seller reasonable notice (A) of any material breach or default (or any event
or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default)
by any party to the Bridge Commitment or definitive document related to the
Bridge Financing of which Buyer or its Affiliates becomes aware and (B) of
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from
any person with respect to any (x) actual or potential material breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Bridge Commitment or
any definitive document related to the Bridge Financing or any provisions of
the Bridge Commitment or any definitive document related to the Bridge
Financing or (y) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties
to the Bridge Commitment or any definitive document related to the Bridge
Financing (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course
negotiations with respect to the terms of the Bridge Financing or any
definitive agreement with respect thereto); _provided_ that in no event
will Buyer be under any obligation to disclose any information that is
subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Buyer shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not
waive such privilege. If any portion of the Bridge Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Bridge
Commitment and any related fee letter, Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources
on terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer, than the
terms set forth in the Bridge Commitment and any related fee letter, in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event and the provisions of this Section 5.12 shall
apply to such Alternative Financing as though it was the Bridge Financing; 
_provided_ that Buyer shall not be required to arrange for such Alternative
Financing or execute any commitment letter or agreement in connection
therewith (the " _New Commitment_ ") on terms and conditions which are
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer than those included in
the Bridge Commitment and any related fee letter that such New Commitment is
replacing;  _provided_ , _further_ that Buyer shall not be required to
arrange for such Alternative Financing or execute any New Commitment in the
event that the proceeds from any 

    ##### 

  

     

capital markets financings or asset sales are sufficient to finance the
payments required under Section 2.3 on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, including the obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, are not conditioned on
the availability of the funding under the Bridge Financing, any capital
markets financing, any Alternative Financing or the receipt by Buyer or its

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 6.1(a)(i) indemnification shall survive until the expiration of the latest applicable statute of limitations and shall not be subject to the limitations contained in Section 9.1(a);  _provided_ , _however_ , that any Tax Attributes of the Company and its Subsidiaries existing on the Closing Date shall be for the sole benefit of Seller and OpCo Indemnitors and, to the extent that any such Tax Attribute is utilized by the Company or any Subsidiary in any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, shall reduce the amount of any indemnity payment to which the Buyer would otherwise be entitled pursuant to this Section 6.1(a)(i).

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) _Tax Indemnification Obligation of Buyer_. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and against any and all Losses and Expenses resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding OpCo and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) for (x) that portion of any Straddle Period that begins after the close of business on the Closing Date (calculated as set forth in Section 6.1(e)) or (y) any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) any Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is liable under Section 6.1(h), (iii) any Taxes attributable to any action taken by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries outside of the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after the Closing; and (iv) any failure by Buyer to comply with or perform or not perform any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Section 6.1.

OpCo shall prepare, at its sole cost and expense the Final Company Consolidated Tax Return and all other Tax Returns described in this Section 6.1(b)(i)(A) in a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including prior Tax elections and accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the Company or its Subsidiaries), except as required by a change in applicable Requirements of Law. The transactions effectuated by the Reorganization Agreement shall be reported on the Final Company Consolidated Tax Return of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any corresponding state or local income Tax Return.

Buyer shall timely pay the Taxes reported on the Final Company Consolidated Tax Return and the other Tax Returns covered by Section 6.1(b)(i)(A) to the applicable Tax Authority.

If the amount of such Taxes exceeds or is less than the Tax Escrow Amount, the Tax Escrow Amount shall be increased or decreased by the amount of such excess or shortfall. In addition, Buyer and the Company and their respective Affiliates shall provide the other party, promptly upon request, with such cooperation and assistance, documents and other information, at the reasonable expense of the requesting party, as may reasonably be requested by such party in connection with the calculation of (i) the Companys historic earnings and profits for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and (ii) the amount of any depreciation recapture under Section 1245 of the Code resulting from the transactions described in the Reorganization Agreement. 

   

 (ii) Until ninety (90) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (including any waivers or extensions thereof), Buyer and OpCo and their respective Affiliates shall provide the other party, promptly upon request, with such cooperation and assistance, documents and other information, at the reasonable expense of the requesting party, as may reasonably be requested by such party in connection with (A) the preparation and filing of any original or amended Tax Return or any other filing with any Tax Authority, (B) the conduct of or defense against any Tax Proceeding, or (C) the verification by a party of an amount payable hereunder to, or receivable hereunder from, another party.

   ##### 

  

    

Affiliates, until ninety (90) days after the expiration of all applicable
statutes of limitations (including any waivers or extensions thereof). The
parties shall promptly notify each other in writing of any waivers,
extensions or expirations of applicable statutes of limitations. 

 

 (d) _Contests_.

    

 (i) After the Closing, each party shall promptly notify the other party of any demand, claim or notice of the commencement of a Tax Proceeding received with respect to Taxes for which OpCo or Buyer is liable pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that a partys failure to give such notice will not affect the other partys rights to indemnification under this Section 6.1 except to the extent that the other party is materially prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax liability and shall include copies of the relevant portion of any notice or other document received from any Tax Authority or any other Person in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. 

   

 (ii) At OpCos request and expense, Buyer shall contest (or cause to be contested) any asserted Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax liability for which OpCo may have an indemnity obligation under Section 6.1(a)(i). If OpCo so elects, OpCo shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense, of any Tax Proceeding involving any asserted Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax liability with respect to the Company and/or its Subsidiaries relating to Pre-Closing Tax Period Taxes for which OpCo is liable pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i); _provided_ that Buyer and its Affiliates shall have the right to participate in such Tax Proceeding, including through counsel of their choosing, at their own expense. OpCo shall keep Buyer fully informed on a timely basis of all matters relating to any Tax Proceeding controlled by OpCo hereunder. OpCo shall not accept any proposed adjustment or enter into any settlement or agreement in compromise regarding any Tax Proceeding controlled by OpCo without the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

   

 (iii) In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall control the conduct of such Tax Proceeding, but OpCo shall have the right to participate in such Tax Proceeding at its own expense; _provided_ that Buyer shall not accept any proposed adjustment or enter into any settlement or agreement in compromise regarding any such Tax Proceeding without OpCos prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer shall keep OpCo fully informed on a timely basis of all matters relating to any Tax Proceeding controlled by Buyer hereunder. 

   

 (iv) Payment by OpCo of any amount due under Section 6.1(a)(i) shall be made within ten (10) days following written notice by Buyer that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Tax Authority or other applicable third party is due; _provided_ that OpCo shall not be required to make any payment earlier than ten (10) days before it is due to the appropriate Tax Authority or applicable third party. Payment by Buyer of any amount due under Section 6.1(a)(ii) shall be made within ten (10) days following written notice by OpCo that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Tax Authority or 

   ##### 

  

    

other applicable third party is due; _provided_ that Buyer shall not be
required to make any payment earlier than ten (10) days before it is due to
the appropriate Tax Authority or applicable third party. In the case of a Tax
that is contested in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.1(d),
payment of such contested Tax will not be considered due earlier than the
date a "final determination" to such effect is made by such Tax Authority.
For this purpose, a "final determination" shall mean a
settlement, compromise, or other agreement with the relevant Tax Authority, a
deficiency notice with respect to which the period for filing a petition with
the Tax court or the relevant state, local or foreign tribunal has expired or
a decision of any court of competent jurisdiction that is not subject to
appeal or as to which the time for appeal has expired. 

 

 (e) _Straddle Periods_.

For purposes of clause (i) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or other item (including the effect of any graduated rates of Tax) that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date on a pro rata basis determined by multiplying the total amount of such item allocated to such period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the such period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period.

  

 (f) _Refunds; Credits_. OpCo shall be entitled to, and Buyer shall promptly pay OpCo, the amount of any Tax refund or credit (except to the extent such refund or credit constitutes a Tax benefit that reduces under Section 9.8 an amount to which a Seller Group Member or Buyer Group Member seeking indemnification under Article IX or this Section 6.1 would otherwise be entitled) actually received by Buyer or its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date to the extent such Tax refund or credit is attributable to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (net of any reasonable costs to Buyer or its Subsidiaries in obtaining such Tax refund or credit). Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain any such refund or credit, including, subject to Section 6.1(b)(ii), through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims. Buyer shall be entitled to, and OpCo shall promptly pay to Buyer, the amount of any Tax refund or credit (except to the extent such refund or credit constitutes a Tax benefit that reduces under Section 9.8 an amount to which a Seller Group Member or Buyer Group Member seeking indemnification under Article IX or this Section 6.1 would otherwise be entitled) actually received by OpCo or its Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding OpCo and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) for any Tax period (or the portion of any Straddle Period) beginning after the Closing Date (net of reasonable costs to OpCo or its Subsidiaries in obtaining such Tax refund or credit). OpCo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such Tax refund or credit.

    ##### 

  

    

 (g) _Termination of Tax Sharing Arrangements_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall cause the termination, prior to the Closing Date, of all Tax Sharing Arrangements among the Company and its Subsidiaries, and after the Closing Date, none of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, Buyer, or any Affiliate of Buyer shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

  

 (h) _Transfer Taxes_. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer in connection with the preparation and filing of any returns with respect to Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns and, where required by applicable Requirements of Law, making or joining with Buyer (or its applicable Affiliate) in making such filings, it being understood that Buyer and OpCo will work jointly and reasonably cooperate in identifying the Transfer Tax filing requirements and preparing the relevant materials for submission. Buyer shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to, pay fifty percent (50%) of any and all real property or direct or indirect equity interest transfer taxes, stamp taxes, stock transfer taxes and other similar Taxes or expenses imposed, and all recording fees that may be imposed, as a result of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and any fines, penalties, interest or additions with respect thereto (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that if any component of Transfer Taxes consists of fines, penalties, interest or additions resulting from any delay or other inaction or omission by either Buyer or Seller in connection with the preparation or filing thereof, Buyer or Seller alone, as the case may be, shall bear all of such fines, penalties, interest or other additions; _provided_ , _further_ , that OpCo shall pay 100% of any Transfer Taxes and recording charges related to any transfers by deed pursuant to the Reorganization.

  

 (i) _Reporting_. To the extent Section 6043A of the Code applies to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the parties shall cooperate with each other and provide each other with all information as is reasonably necessary for the parties to satisfy the reporting obligations under Section 6043A of the Code.

  

 (j) _Unified Loss_. Buyer shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries but excluding OpCo and its Subsidiaries) to, cooperate with Seller, OpCo and their respective Affiliates in making any elections (including protective elections) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36 (and any similar provisions of state, local or foreign Requirements of Law) that Seller or OpCo desires to make with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement.

 Section 9.2 _Indemnification of Seller_.

 (b) The indemnification provided for in Section 9.2(a) shall survive for the Claim Period (and no claims shall be made by any Seller Group Member under Section 9.2(a) thereafter);  _provided_ , _however_ that any covenant contained in this Agreement that, by its terms, provides for performance following the Closing Date shall survive until such covenant is performed,  _provided_ , _further_ , that Section 4.1 and Section 4.2(a) shall survive the Closing indefinitely; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the indemnification of Seller Group Members shall continue as to any Loss or Expense of which any Seller Group Member has timely given Buyer a Claim Notice in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.3 on or prior to the date on which such indemnification claim may be made under the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.2(b), as to which the right of the Seller Group Member to be indemnified shall continue until the liability shall have been determined pursuant to this Article IX, and all Seller Group Members shall have been reimbursed for the full amount of such Loss and Expense as to which they are entitled to indemnification in accordance with this Article IX.

for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then
known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim
and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other Contract,
document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon
which such claim is based. A Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or
suit in equity by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will
be sought (each, a " _Third-Person Claim_ ") shall be given promptly and in
any event within fifteen (15) days after the action or suit is commenced. The
failure of any Seller Group Member or Buyer Group Member seeking
indemnification hereunder (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to give the
Claim Notice promptly as required by this Section 9.3 shall not affect such
Indemnified Partys rights under this Article IX except to the extent such
failure is actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations of the party
obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the "
_Indemnitor_ "). 

  

 (b) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX, after the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this Article IX shall be determined: (i) by written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; or (ii) by the final judgment or decree of a court, which shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.

  

 (c) Upon the determination of any amount of indemnification payable to the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.3(b), if cash remains in the Indemnity Escrow, Buyer and Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute cash from the Indemnity Escrow to the Person or Persons entitled thereto in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the procedures with respect to notice of claims for any and all matters relating to Taxes shall be governed exclusively by Section 6.1 and shall not be governed by the above provisions of this Section 9.3.

  

 Section 9.4 _Third-Person Claims_.

  

 (a) The Indemnitor shall have the right to conduct and control, in good faith and at its expense, through counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third-Person Claim by delivering written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the Indemnitors receipt of the Claim Notice relating to such Third-Person Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such Third-Person Claim as to which the Indemnitor has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor will bear the reasonable expenses of one such separate counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction (and shall pay such expenses as incurred) if the defendants in, or targets of, any such Action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor, and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there are or are reasonably likely to be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnitor or that representation by the same counsel is or is reasonably likely to be a conflict of interest; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which written consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) pay, compromise or settle any such Third-Person Claim unless such payment,

    ##### 

  

     

settlement or compromise is solely for monetary damages, by its terms
obligates the Indemnitor to pay the full amount of the liability in
connection with such Third-Person Claim and includes an unconditional release
of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Third-
Person Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to pay, settle or compromise any such Third-Person Claim without
such consent, _provided_ that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive
any right to indemnity therefor hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to have
sole control over (and if it so desires, the Indemnified Party shall have
sole control over) the defense, settlement or compromise of (but the
Indemnitor shall nevertheless be required to pay all Losses and Expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such defense,
settlement or compromise to the extent required pursuant to this Article IX):
(i) any Third-Person Claim that seeks only an order, injunction or other
equitable relief against any Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates that
does not involve the payment of money other than in a de minimis amount or
(ii) any Third-Person Claim reasonably expected to have a material adverse
financial impact on such Indemnified Partys business relationship with such
Third-Person or its Affiliates that is materially greater than the amount
that would be reasonably expected to be indemnified by the Indemnitor if such
Third-Person Claim were adversely determined against such Indemnified Party
and Indemnitor. 

  

 (b) If the Indemnitor elects not to assume the defense, settlement or compromise of an asserted liability, fails to timely and properly notify the Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided or, at any time after assuming such defense, fails to diligently defend against such Third-Person Claim in good faith or fails to have sufficient financial resources to pay the full amount of such potential liability in connection with such Third-Person Claim (taking into account the balance of the Indemnity Escrow), the Indemnified Party may, at the Indemnitors expense, pay, defend, settle or compromise such asserted liability (but the Indemnitor shall nevertheless be required to pay all Losses and Expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such payment, defense, settlement or compromise to the extent required pursuant hereto, subject to the limitations on such Indemnitors indemnification obligations hereunder);  _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnified Party will, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any Third-Person Claim;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnitor may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such Third-Person Claim as to which the Indemnitor is not conducting and controlling the defense thereof pursuant to this Section 9.4(b). In connection with any defense of a Third-Person Claim (whether by the Indemnitor or the Indemnified Party), each of OpCo and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in good faith in the defense or prosecution thereof, including providing the Indemnitor and its representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, to all personnel who may have knowledge of the facts and circumstances, and to all their respective properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records, relating to any claim by an Indemnified Party and to retain and furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested by a party hereto in connection therewith.

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the procedures with respect to the conduct and control of the defense, compromise or settlement of any Third-Person Claim for any and all

    ##### 

  

     

matters relating to Taxes shall be governed exclusively by Section 6.1 and
shall not be governed by the above provisions of this Section 9.4. 

  

 Section 9.5 _No Contribution by the Company_. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller may not seek contribution from the Company with respect to any indemnification obligation hereunder.

  

 Section 9.6 _Application of Escrow_. Any indemnification obligations of the OpCo Indemnitors under this Article IX shall be paid first from the Indemnity Escrow and, after the Indemnity Escrow has been depleted or is subject to pending Indemnity Claims in excess of the then-current balance in the Indemnity Escrow, then recovered directly from OpCo Indemnitors, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX.

  

 Section 9.7 _Limitations_. Following the Closing, the indemnification obligations of the parties under this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties and any parties claiming by or through any party (including the Indemnified Parties) with respect to this Agreement, and for Losses and Expenses in connection with this Agreement, except with respect to equitable remedies or in the case of claims relating to fraud; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 9.7 shall in any way limit or preclude any method of recovery or recourse against any party for breaches of this Agreement by such party prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Section 11.15. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Indemnitor shall be liable for any punitive or exemplary damages, except for punitive or exemplary damages actually paid to a third party in a Third-Person Claim by an Indemnified Party. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery (i) due to facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, (ii) due to facts giving rise to such liability under more than one of Section 9.1(a)(i), Section 9.1(a)(ii), Section 9.1(a)(iii), Section 9.1(a)(iv), Section 9.1(a)(v) or Section 9.1(a)(vi), (iii) due to facts taken into account in determining any adjustment to the Closing Consideration or (iv) any Losses, liabilities or payments pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement.

  

 Section 9.8 _Adjustments to Purchase Price; Net Recovery; Duty to Mitigate_.

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary: (i) any Losses or Expenses paid to an Indemnified Party under this Article IX or Section 6.1 shall be deemed adjustments to the aggregate purchase price paid for the Membership Interests; and (ii) Losses or Expenses payable to an Indemnified Party under this Article IX or Section 6.1 shall be determined net of (A) any recovery actually received by any Indemnified Party (or, with respect to the Company as an Indemnified Party, by any of its Subsidiaries), including from any insurer or any seller of assets or securities to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that where receipt has not yet occurred, no adjustment shall be made until the time of such receipt (at which time the amount of any overpayment shall be immediately returned), and (B) any net Tax benefit actually realized by any Indemnified Party (or, with respect to the Company as an Indemnified Party, by any of its Subsidiaries) due to such Losses or Expenses in a Tax year in which such Losses or Expenses were incurred or as the result of the receipt of an indemnity payment by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX or Section 6.1 in that same Tax year. Buyer shall exercise reasonable best efforts to recover any amounts available to offset any

    ##### 

  

     

Losses or Expenses payable from the Indemnity Escrow hereunder, including from
any insurer, any Tax Authority, or any seller of assets or securities to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
connection with the efforts to recover amounts to offset such Losses or
Expenses, Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to (x)
incur any out-of-pocket costs or expenses or pay any other amounts to third
parties, (y) make any claims or initiate any legal proceedings against third
parties or (z) take any other action to the extent such action would
adversely affect such party in any material respect. If any Indemnified
Party receives any indemnification payment pursuant to this Article IX or
Section 6.1, at the election of the Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to assign to the Indemnitor all of its
claims for recovery against third persons as to such Losses, whether
by insurance coverage, contribution claims, subrogation or otherwise. 

  

 (b) An Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses or Expenses for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification before such Losses or Expenses actually are incurred by the Indemnified Party.

thereto with regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings and letters of intent between
or among any of the parties hereto or thereto. 

   

 (b) This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of the parties hereto. No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 11.7 _Interpretation_. For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation," (b) the word "or" is not exclusive and (c) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole.

The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 

  

 Section 11.9 _Expenses_. Subject to Section 6.1 herein, each of the parties hereto shall bear its own costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of its counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other financial, legal, accounting or other advisors), incurred by it or its Affiliates in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each of the other documents and instruments executed in connection with or contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (collectively, the " _Transaction Costs_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall pay for all third party reports, title policies and survey updates and any costs incurred in connection with Indebtedness of the Company; _provided_ , 

   #####

received by Buyer with respect to the Facilities which expressly provide that
they may be relied upon by Seller, the Company and their successors, for an
amount equal to Buyers cost of such third party reports. The term "
_Transaction Cost_ " shall include any change-in-control or similar payments
(excluding severance payments) payable to Company employees or service
providers, pursuant to employment or consulting agreements binding the

 Section 11.10 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

 Section 11.13 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_. 

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

  

 (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any other court of the State of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware (and of the appropriate appellate courts from any of the foregoing courts) in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware and (iv) agrees that each of the other parties

or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions

 Section 11.14 _Savings Clause_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any indemnification amount paid to any Buyer Group Member pursuant this Agreement in any tax year exceed the maximum amount that can be paid in such year without causing any Buyer Group Member to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT Requirements_ ") for such year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(I) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") as determined by independent accountants to Buyer. If the amount payable for any tax year under the preceding sentence is less than the amount which Seller would otherwise be obligated to pay to the indemnified Buyer Group Member pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Indemnifiable Amount_ "), the indemnified Buyer Group Member shall so notify Seller, and Seller shall (at the indemnified Buyer Group Members sole cost and expense) place the remaining portion of the indemnification payment in escrow and shall not execute any instrumentation permitting a release of any portion thereof to the indemnified Buyer Group Member, and the indemnified Buyer Group Member shall not be entitled to any such amount, unless and until Seller and escrow holder receive (all at the indemnified Buyer Group Members sole cost and expense) notice from Buyer, together with either (a) an opinion of Buyers tax counsel to the effect that such amount, if and to the extent paid, would not constitute gross income which is not Qualifying Income or (b) a letter from Buyers independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to the indemnified Buyer Group Member without causing any indemnified Buyer Group Member to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any relevant taxable year, together with either a ruling from the IRS issued to Buyer or an opinion of Buyers tax counsel to the effect that such payment would not be treated as includible in the income of the applicable indemnified Buyer Group Member for any prior taxable year, in which event the escrow holder shall pay such maximum amount. Sellers and escrow holders obligation to pay any unpaid portion of such indemnification amount shall terminate ten (10) years from the date of this Agreement and, upon such date, escrow holder shall remit any remaining funds in escrow to Seller and Seller shall have no obligation to make any further payments to the indemnified Buyer Group Member notwithstanding that the entire indemnification amount has not been paid as of such date. 

  

 Section 11.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement and any other agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith and this right shall include the right of Seller to cause Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby if the conditions set forth in Article VII and Article VIII have been satisfied or waived (by the party entitled to waive such conditions) (other than conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at Closing). The 

   ##### 

  

 

parties further agree that (a) by seeking the remedies provided for in this
Section 11.15, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any
other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement, including monetary damages in the event that the remedies provided
for in this Section 11.15 are not available or otherwise are not granted and
(b) nothing contained in this Section 11.15 shall require any party to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute
any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 11.15 before
exercising any termination right under Article X (and pursuing damages after
such termination) nor shall the commencement of any Action pursuant to this
Section 11.15 or anything contained in this Section 11.15 restrict or limit
any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
Article X or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter.
