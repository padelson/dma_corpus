indemnification amount paid to any Buyer Group Member pursuant this Agreement in any tax year
exceed the maximum amount that can be paid in such year without causing any Buyer Group Member to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of the Code (the &#147;<U><B>REIT
Requirements</B></U>&#148;) for such year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
income described in Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2)(A)-(I) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (&#147;<U><B>Qualifying
Income</B></U>&#148;) as determined by independent accountants to Buyer. If the amount payable for any tax
year under the preceding sentence is less than the amount which Seller would otherwise be obligated
to pay to the indemnified Buyer Group Member pursuant to this Agreement (the &#147;<U><B>Indemnifiable
Amount</B></U>&#148;), the indemnified Buyer Group Member shall so notify Seller, and Seller shall (at the
indemnified Buyer Group Member&#146;s sole cost and expense) place the remaining portion of the
indemnification payment in escrow and shall not execute any instrumentation permitting a release of
any portion thereof to the indemnified Buyer Group Member, and the indemnified Buyer Group Member
shall not be entitled to any such amount, unless and until Seller and escrow holder receive (all at
the indemnified Buyer Group Member&#146;s sole cost and expense) notice from Buyer, together with either
(a)&nbsp;an opinion of Buyer&#146;s tax counsel to the effect that such amount, if and to the extent paid,
would not constitute gross income which is not Qualifying Income or (b)&nbsp;a letter from Buyer&#146;s
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to the
indemnified Buyer Group Member without causing any indemnified Buyer Group Member to fail to meet
the REIT Requirements for any relevant taxable year, together with either a ruling from the IRS
issued to Buyer or an opinion of Buyer&#146;s tax counsel to the effect that such payment would not be
treated as includible in the income of the applicable indemnified Buyer Group Member for any prior
taxable year, in which event the escrow holder shall pay such maximum amount. Seller&#146;s and escrow
holder&#146;s obligation to pay any unpaid portion of such indemnification amount shall terminate ten
(10)&nbsp;years from the date of this Agreement and, upon such date, escrow holder shall remit any
remaining funds in escrow to Seller and Seller shall have no obligation to make
any further payments to the indemnified Buyer Group Member notwithstanding that the entire
indemnification amount has not been paid as of such date.
