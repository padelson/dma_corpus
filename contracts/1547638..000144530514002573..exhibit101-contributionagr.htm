9 ARTICLE IV 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TEXSTAR REGARDING TEXSTAR

TexStar hereby represents and warrants to SXE as follows:

4.1 Organization and Good Standing. TexStar is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized and has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and any other Operative Document
to which it is a party and to consummate the Transactions.

4.2 Power and Authority. The execution and delivery by TexStar of this
Agreement and the other Operative Documents to which it is a party, and the
performance of the Transactions by TexStar, have been duly authorized by the
general partner of TexStar, and no other action on the part of TexStar or its
general partner is necessary to authorize this Agreement and the other
Operative Documents to which TexStar is a party or to consummate the
Transactions. This Agreement and each other Operative Document to which
TexStar is a party has been or will be duly and validly executed and delivered
by TexStar, and constitutes or will constitute a valid and binding obligation
of TexStar, enforceable against TexStar in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors
generally, (b) equitable principles which may limit the availability of
certain equitable remedies (such as specific performance) in certain instances
and (c) public policy considerations with respect to the enforceability of
rights of indemnification.

4.3 No Conflict; Consents.

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.3, neither the execution and delivery by
TexStar of this Agreement and the other Operative Documents to which TexStar
is a party nor consummation or performance by TexStar of the Transactions
will: (i) conflict with or violate any Law binding upon TexStar, (ii) conflict
with or violate the Organizational Documents of TexStar, (iii) conflict with
or violate any judgment, decree or order to which TexStar is bound, (iv)
conflict with or result in a material violation of any provision of or
constitute (with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time or
both) a material default under or give rise (with or without the giving of
notice or the passage of time or both) to any right of termination,
cancelation, acceleration or loss of benefit under, or require any actions
(including obtaining the consent of any Person or providing notice to any
Person) under, any material Contract to which TexStar is a party or by which
TexStar or any of its properties may be bound or result in the imposition of
an Encumbrance on any of the Frio Interests, other than in the case of clauses
(ii), (iii) and (iv), such conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations,
cancelations or accelerations that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
TexStar's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions.



(b) TexStar has obtained or otherwise received all authorizations, consents,
orders, approvals, declarations and filings with respect to TexStar's entry
into the Operative Documents.





10 4.4 Ownership Interests. TexStar owns and has good and valid title to the Frio
Interests, free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than restrictions on
transfer pursuant to applicable securities Laws, the Organizational Documents
of Frio LP and Frio GP and Encumbrances under the BBTS Credit Facility that
will be released in full at Closing). TexStar is not a party to any voting
trust, proxy or other agreement or understanding with respect to the voting of
the Frio Interests. Other than in connection with this Agreement, TexStar is
not a party to any Contract pursuant to which TexStar has, directly or
indirectly, granted any option, warrant or other right to any Person to
acquire any Equity Interests in any member of the TexStar Group.

4.5 Financial Advisors. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.5, no brokerage or
finder's fees or commissions are or will be payable by TexStar or its
Affiliates to any broker, financial advisor or consultant, finder, placement
agent, investment banker, intermediary, bank or other Person with respect to
the Transactions.

4.6 No Litigation. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of
TexStar, threatened against TexStar that seeks to enjoin, restrict, limit or
obtain monetary damages in respect of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or TexStar's performance under this Agreement or in respect of the
Transactions.

4.7 Acquisition of PIK Common Units.

(a) TexStar has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the PIK Common Units being issued to TexStar in connection with
the Transactions (the "TexStar SXE Interest"), and is capable of bearing the
economic risk of such investment. TexStar is an "accredited investor" as that
term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D (without regard to Rule 501(a)(4))
promulgated under the Securities Act. TexStar is acquiring the TexStar SXE
Interest for investment for its own account and not with a view toward or for
sale in connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present
intention of distributing or selling the TexStar SXE Interest, in violation of
the Securities Act. Other than pursuant to the Master Contribution Agreement,
TexStar does not have any Contract with any Person to sell, transfer or grant
participations to such Person or to any other Person with respect to the
TexStar SXE Interest. TexStar acknowledges and understands that (i) its
acquisition of the TexStar SXE Interest has not been registered under the
Securities Act in reliance on an exemption therefrom and (ii) the TexStar SXE
Interest will, upon such acquisition, be characterized as "restricted
securities" under state and federal securities Laws. TexStar further
acknowledges and understands that the TexStar SXE Interest may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of
except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities
Act or pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act, and in compliance with other applicable state and
federal securities Laws.

(b) TexStar has undertaken such investigation as it has deemed necessary to
enable it to make an informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the other Operative Documents, and the
acquisition of the TexStar SXE Interest. TexStar has had an opportunity to ask
questions and receive answers from SXE regarding the business, properties,
prospects and financial condition of the members of the SXE Group and SXE GP.



11 ARTICLE V 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TEXSTAR REGARDING THE TEXSTAR GROUP AND THE
TEXSTAR BUSINESS

TexStar hereby represents and warrants to SXE and SXE Energy as follows:

5.1 Organization and Qualification.

(a) Each member of the TexStar Group (i) is duly organized, validly existing

organized and is duly authorized and qualified to carry on its respective
TexStar Business, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business requires such

as set forth in the TexStar Financial Statements, there has been no material
change of the accounting (tax or otherwise) policies, practices or procedures

(a) Schedule 5.18(a) sets forth a true and complete list of all material
Benefit Plans that are or are required to be sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by each member of the TexStar Group or any other corporation or
trade or business under common control with any of them or treated as a single
employer with any of them as determined under Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o)
of the Code (an "TexStar ERISA Affiliate"), or under which any of them or any
TexStar ERISA Affiliate has any current or future obligation or liability,
contingent or otherwise with respect to a present or former officer, employee,
agent or consultant of any member of the TexStar Group or under which any
present or former officer, employee, agent or consultant of any member of the
TexStar Group, or such present or former officer's, employee's, agent's or
consultant's dependents or beneficiaries, have any current or future right to
benefits. For purposes of this Section 5.18, the term "Benefit Plans" refers
to the Benefit Plans applicable to the TexStar Group, and shall not refer to
the Benefit Plans of any member of the SXE Group. For purposes of this Section
5.18, the term "SXE Group" shall include SXE GP.

(b) Schedule 5.18(b) identifies as such all Benefit Plans, if any, which are
(i) qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, (ii) severance, continuation
pay, termination pay or deferred compensation arrangements (including any such
arrangements contained in an employment, advisory or consulting agreement),

any other liability, contingent or otherwise, with respect to a "defined
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, a pension plan subject to
the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code, or a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. No other
trade or business (other than a member of the TexStar Group or a TexStar ERISA

as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA.

(e) There does not exist any condition, there has not occurred any event, and
there has not been any omission, with respect to the sponsorship, funding or

or material claim with respect to any of the TexStar Assets, or any member of
the SXE Group being liable for any contribution, withdrawal liability,
benefit, claim, settlement, Tax, penalty, payment or liability of any material
nature. All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Benefit
Plan (including all employer contributions and employee salary reduction
contributions) have been timely made in accordance with applicable Law,
including 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-102.

(f) Each group health plan that provides health coverage to any present or
former employee of a member of the TexStar Group has operated in compliance,
except for any immaterial error, with all requirements of Sections 601 through

thereunder (and any applicable similar state Law), relating to the
continuation of coverage under certain circumstances in which coverage would
otherwise cease.

(g) Each Benefit Plan has at all times been maintained, administered, and
operated in all material respects in accordance with its terms, all applicable
provisions of ERISA (including the "fiduciary responsibility" and "prohibited
transaction" rules thereof), the Code and other applicable Laws, and each
Benefit Plan intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code
and each trust forming a part thereof is the subject of a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service as to the
qualification under the Code of such Benefit Plan and the tax-exempt status of
such related trust, and nothing has occurred since the date of such
determination letter that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualification of such Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt status of such related
trust. There are no active suits, governmental investigations or proceedings
pending or, to the Knowledge of TexStar, threatened against or concerning any
Benefit Plan or against any fiduciary thereof respecting the fiduciary's
duties to the Benefit Plan or any trust under the Benefit Plan. There is no
action or claim (other than routine claims for benefits made in the ordinary
course of Plan administration) pending or, to the Knowledge of TexStar,
threatened against or with respect to any Benefit Plan and, to the Knowledge
of TexStar, no facts exist which could give rise to any such action or claim.

(h) No member of the TexStar Group or any TexStar ERISA Affiliate has ever
maintained or contributed to a trust that is subject to Section 501(c)(9) of
the Code and none of the Benefit Plans that are welfare benefit plans within
the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA provide for health or life insurance or
other welfare-type benefits for current or future retired or terminated
directors, officers or employees of a member of the TexStar Group or any
TexStar ERISA Affiliate or their beneficiaries, except to the extent required
under ERISA Section 601 et seq., or by Section 4980B of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder or other similar state Law, and, except as
disclosed on Schedule 5.18(h), at the sole expense of the participant.

(i) All insurance premiums due or payable with respect to the periods from the
end of the most recent Benefit Plan or contract year to and including the
Closing Date have



25 been paid or fully accrued in the TexStar Financial Statements. No such
premium is overdue or in a grace period for late payments.

(j) All contributions, expenses and unfunded liabilities for prior plan years
which are not yet due and with respect to the current Benefit Plan year for
the period ending on the Closing Date relating to all of the Benefit Plans
have been made or accrued in accordance with GAAP in the TexStar Financial
Statements, and, to the extent required, in the TexStar Financial Statements
of the applicable Benefit Plan.

(k) Any fidelity bond required to be obtained under ERISA with respect to any
Benefit Plan has been obtained and is in full force and effect.

(l) The consummation of the Transactions will not (either alone or in
connection with the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) result
in a nondeductible expense pursuant to Section 280G of the Code or an excise
tax to any "disqualified individual" pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

(m) Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.18(m), neither the execution of this
Agreement nor other Operative Documents by the members of the TexStar Group
and the performance by each of them hereunder or thereunder, nor the
consummation of the Transactions will (i) entitle any employees, former
employees or other service providers of any member of the TexStar Group or any
TexStar ERISA Affiliate to severance pay or severance benefits, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, trigger any payment of compensation
or benefits or forgiveness of indebtedness under, increase the amount payable
under or trigger any other obligation pursuant to, any of the Benefit Plans,
(iii) obligate any member of the SXE Group to continue any of the Benefit
Plans or (iv) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any of
the Benefit Plans.

(n) No provision of any Benefit Plan would prevent the amendment or
termination of any such Benefit Plan assumed or continued by any member of the
SXE Group pursuant to the Transactions without material liability, other than
the (i) the obligation for ordinary benefits accrued before the termination of
such Benefit Plan and (ii) payment of any insurance premiums and plan
administration fees for the remaining term of the applicable contract. No
action or omission of any member of the TexStar Group or any TexStar ERISA
Affiliate, or any manager, officer, or agent thereof in any way restricts,
impairs or prohibits any of the members of the TexStar Group or any TexStar
ERISA Affiliate, or any successor, from amending, merging or terminating any
of the Benefit Plans in accordance with the express terms of any such plan and
applicable Law.

(o) No Person that was engaged by Frio GP or Frio LP or, to the Knowledge of
TexStar, any TexStar JV Entity as an independent contractor or in any other
non-employee capacity can or will be characterized or deemed to be an employee
of a member of the TexStar Group or any TexStar ERISA Affiliate under
applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and administrative proceedings
for any purpose whatsoever including for purposes of federal, state and local
income taxation, workers' compensation and



26 unemployment insurance and eligibility for the Benefit Plans or for purposes
of applying any fee, Tax or penalty under applicable Law.

5.19 Insurance Coverage. Schedule 5.19 sets forth a list of all insurance
policies, formal self-insurance programs and bonds currently maintained by
each member of the TexStar Group. All such insurance policies and bonds have
been made available to SXE. All such insurance policies are in full force and
effect, all premiums with respect thereto covering all periods up to and
including the Closing have been paid and no notice of cancelation or
termination has been received with respect to any such insurance policy.

5.20 Intellectual Property. None of Frio GP or Frio LP or, to the Knowledge of
TexStar, any TexStar JV Entity has received any written notice asserting that
the conduct of the TexStar Business infringes upon or violates any
Intellectual Property of any Person. Schedule 5.20 lists all material software
licenses, patents and other registered Intellectual Property used in the
conduct of the TexStar Business, other than programs existing on any personal

of the TexStar Group owns or has valid rights to use all the Intellectual
Property of such Person without conflict with the rights of others.

5.21 Customers and Suppliers. Schedule 5.21 sets forth a true and complete
list of the top ten customers and top ten suppliers to Frio LP, as measured by
the dollar amount of purchases therefrom or thereby for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2013. None of such customers or suppliers has provided TexStar or
Frio LP, or their Affiliates, any written notice which canceled, materially
modified or otherwise terminated its relationship with such Person or
materially decreased its services, supplies or materials to such Person or its
usage or purchase of the services or products of such Person.

5.22 Current Business. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.22, no member of the
TexStar Group has engaged in any material business activity other than the

Financial Statement, there has been no condemnation, seizure, damage,
destruction or other casualty loss (whether or not covered by insurance)
affecting any of the TexStar Assets in any material respect which has not
subsequently been repaired, replaced or restored. None of TexStar, Frio GP,
Frio LP or, to the Knowledge of TexStar, any TexStar JV Entity has received
written notice of and there is not any pending or, to the Knowledge of
TexStar, threatened or contemplated condemnation Proceeding affecting any of
the TexStar Assets (or any portion thereof), or of any sale or other
disposition of any of the TexStar Assets (or any portion thereof) in lieu of
condemnation.

Group that are necessary for the ownership and operation of the TexStar Assets

6.5 SXE SEC Documents. SXE has filed all reports, schedules, forms,
certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other statements
required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2013 (collectively,
and together with any other reports on Form 8-K filed on a voluntary basis,
and in each case including all other exhibits and schedules thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein, the "SXE SEC Documents"). As of
their respective dates, the SXE SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such SXE SEC Documents, and none of the SXE SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The financial statements of SXE included in the SXE SEC
Documents were prepared from the books and records of SXE and its
Subsidiaries, complied in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
and in accordance with applicable requirements of GAAP (subject, in the case
of the unaudited statements, to normal, recurring adjustments, none of which
is material) the consolidated financial position of SXE and its Subsidiaries
as of their respective dates and the consolidated results of operations and
the consolidated cash flows of SXE and its Subsidiaries for the periods
presented therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing statements, SXE and SXE
Energy shall have no liability with respect to any information in or any
exhibit to any Form 8-K of SXE that is deemed not to be "filed" and is not
specifically identified in any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act as being incorporated therein by reference.

6.6 Absence of Changes. Except as disclosed in, or reflected in the financial
statements included in, the SXE SEC Documents, since December 31, 2013, SXE
has conducted its business



31 in the Ordinary Course of Business, and there has not been (a) any material
damage, destruction or other casualty loss (whether or not covered by
insurance) affecting the business or assets owned by SXE or its Subsidiaries,
or (b) any other transaction, commitment, dispute or other event or condition
(financial or otherwise) of any character (whether or not in the Ordinary
Course of Business), in each case, which has had or which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the SXE Group.

6.7 Proceedings. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of SXE,
threatened against SXE or SXE Energy that seeks to enjoin, restrict, limit or
obtain monetary damages in respect of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or SXE's or SXE Energy's performance under this Agreement or in
respect of the Transactions. There is no unsatisfied judgment, court order,
arbitral award or administrative decision against a member of the SXE Group,
its business or the SXE Assets, and no order has been made or petition
presented or resolution passed or other steps taken for the winding up or
dissolution of any member of the SXE Group. There has been no appointment, and
no such appointment is planned by a member of the SXE Group, of an
administrator, receiver, liquidator or liquidation committee or like body or
officer of a member of the SXE Group or the SXE Assets. To the Knowledge of
SXE, there is no basis for any Proceeding which, if adversely determined
against a member of the SXE Group or its Representatives (in the capacity in
which such Representative is affiliated with such Person) that would
reasonably be expected to result in a loss to the SXE Group, individually or
in the aggregate, in excess of $500,000.

6.8 Taxes. From and at all times since its formation, SXE has qualified as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(c) of the
Code, and all Tax Returns of SXE have been prepared consistently therewith.

6.9 Financial Capability. SXE has, and at the Closing will have, sufficient
funds available to pay the Cash Consideration and any fees and expenses
incurred by the SXE Group in connection with the Transactions.

6.10 Financial Advisors. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.10, no brokerage or
finder's fees or commissions are or will be payable by SXE or its Affiliates
to any broker, financial advisor or consultant, finder, placement agent,
investment banker, intermediary, bank or other Person with respect to the
Transactions.

6.11 Acquisition of Frio Interests.

(a) SXE has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so
as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Frio Interests, and is capable of bearing the economic risk of such
investment. SXE is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D (without regard to Rule 501(a)(4)) promulgated under the
Securities Act. SXE is acquiring the Frio Interests for investment for its own
account and not with a view toward or for sale in connection with any
distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling
the Frio Interests (except with respect to the distribution of the Frio
Interests to SXE Energy). SXE acknowledges and understands that (i) its
acquisition of the Frio Interests has not been registered under the Securities
Act in reliance on an exemption therefrom and (ii) the Frio



32 Interests may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an available
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in
compliance with other applicable state and federal securities Laws.

(b) SXE has undertaken such investigation as it has deemed necessary to enable
it to make an informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Operative Documents, and the
acquisition of the Frio Interests. SXE has had an opportunity to ask questions
and receive answers from TexStar regarding the business, properties, prospects
and financial condition of the members of the TexStar Group.

Transaction or any of the matters described in this Section 7.4. Each such
Party shall promptly inform the other Parties of any oral communication with,
and provide copies of written communications with, any Governmental Authority
regarding any such communication. No Party shall independently participate in
any formal meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such
filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other Parties
prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable

to proceedings under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this

hereafter acquired by such Persons or (ii) terminate any existing
relationships and contractual rights or obligations.

7.5 Notification. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, promptly
following discovery thereof, each Party shall provide prompt written notice to
the other Party of (a) in the case of TexStar, the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event of which to the Knowledge of TexStar causes or would be
reasonably likely to cause the condition in Section 2.5(a) to fail to be
satisfied or the failure of TexStar to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it hereunder prior to
Closing and (b) in the case of SXE, the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event of which to the Knowledge of SXE causes or would be reasonably
likely to cause the condition in Section 2.4(a) to fail to be satisfied or the
failure of SXE or SXE Energy to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant or agreement to be complied with by it hereunder prior to
Closing. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be for
informational purposes only, and shall not in any way be deemed to cure any
inaccuracy or breach of any provision of this Agreement or in any way limit or
affect any rights or remedies under this Agreement (including rights to
indemnification).

7.6 Conditions. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the conditions to closing applicable to such Party in Article II to be
satisfied and to consummate the Transactions as soon reasonably possible after
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article II (other than those
to be satisfied at the Closing).

7.7 Preparation of Supporting Documents. The Parties shall take such actions,
shall furnish such information and shall prepare, or cooperate in preparing,
and execute and deliver, such certificates, agreements and other instruments
as the other such Party or Parties may reasonably request from time to time,
before, at or after the Closing, with respect to the Transactions and the
performance of the obligations under this Agreement and each other Operative
Document to which it is a party or, with respect to TexStar, to which a member
of the TexStar Group is a party, and with respect to SXE, to which a member of
the SXE Group is a party.

7.8 Transaction Expenses. Each Party shall bear and be responsible for all
fees and expenses incurred by such Party (whether incurred before, at or after
the date of this Agreement) in connection with the Transactions, including the
fees and expenses of legal counsel, accountants and all other third party
consultants and advisors engaged by such Party to assist it in the
structuring, negotiation, documentation and implementation of the Transactions
("Transaction Expenses").

7.9 Exclusivity. From the date hereof until the consummation of the
Transactions or the earlier termination of this Agreement, except with respect
to the TexStar Rich Gas Restructuring, TexStar shall not, and shall cause each
member of the TexStar Group, and the Representatives of the foregoing, not to,
directly or indirectly (a) solicit or initiate, or encourage the submission
of, proposals or offers relating to, (b) respond to any submissions, proposals
or offers relating to (other



37 than to inform any person of such Party's obligations under this paragraph),
(c) engage in any negotiations or discussions with any Person relating to or
(d) enter into any Contract or otherwise cooperate in any way with any other
Person in connection with, in each case, any transaction similar to the
transactions contemplated hereunder or otherwise with respect to the TexStar
Assets without first obtaining the written approval of the other Parties.

7.10 Publicity. The initial press release with respect to the execution of
this Agreement shall be reasonably agreed upon by TexStar and SXE. Thereafter,
the Parties shall promptly advise and cooperate with each other before
issuing, or permitting any of its Representatives to issue, any press release
or other form of public announcement with respect to any Operative Documents
or the Transactions. The Parties agree that all such press releases or other
forms of public announcement with respect to the Operative Documents or the
Transactions are subject to the prior approval of the other Parties, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that the
Parties shall be entitled to issue a press release or make a public
announcement with respect to the Operative Documents or the Transactions if
such Party, as the issuer of such press release or other form of public
announcement, has received advice from its counsel to the effect that such
press release is required by Law or listing agreement with a national security
exchange or the rules of such exchange, including the NYSE or the SEC. If a
Party is required by Law or listing agreement with a national security
exchange or the rules of such exchange to make any release concerning any
Operative Document or the Transactions, then such party agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) provide advance notice of at least two
Business Days to the other Parties of such release, which such notice shall
include the content of such release, and (b) incorporate the reasonable
comments proposed by the non-issuing Party.

7.11 Confidentiality. Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which shall remain in full force in
accordance with this Section 7.11, the Parties shall hold any information
received in connection with the Transactions in confidence in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to limit the restrictions set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement. If the Closing occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate (which termination shall be effective as of the Closing).

7.12 Restructuring. Prior to the Closing, TexStar shall take, or cause to be
taken, the following actions (collectively, the "TexStar Rich Gas
Restructuring"):

(a) Frio LP shall effect a divisive merger (the "Merger"), in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to SXE, in accordance with Chapter 10 of the
Texas Business Organizations Code and pursuant to which, among other things:

(i) Frio LP shall be a surviving entity in the Merger and shall change its
name in connection with the Merger;

(ii) a new Texas limited partnership shall be created by the Merger ("New Frio
LP"), whose sole general partner shall be a newly-formed Texas limited
liability company of which TexStar will be the sole member; and



38 (iii) all of the assets of Frio LP, other than assets related to the TexStar
rich gas system (including those assets set forth on Schedule 7.12), shall be
vested in New Frio LP.

(b) TexStar shall contribute to Frio LP all of the Equity Interests in the
TexStar JV Entities held by TexStar and TexStar and Frio LP shall take such
other actions as may be reasonably necessary to further evidence such
transfer, including delivering notice of such transfer to Atlas and executing
a joinder agreement to the Organizational Documents of T2 EFC Holdings, T2 EF
Gathering and T2 LaSalle Gathering.

7.13 Tax Matters.

(a) Closing of the Books. SXE shall, to the extent permitted under Law and
each such entity's Organizational Documents, cause each Contributed Entity
(or, in the case of the T2 LaSalle Entities, use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause) to allocate all items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit attributable to the taxable period of the Contributed Entity in which
the Closing occurs based on an interim closing of the books of such
Contributed Entity as of the end of the Closing Date consistent with Section
7.13(d) (to the extent the Contributed Entity's Tax period does not otherwise
end on the Closing Date).

(b) Return Preparation. SXE GP shall, at its sole cost and expense, timely
prepare or cause to be timely prepared all Tax Returns of the Contributed
Entities due after the Closing Date that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
including a Straddle Period (the "Post-Closing Returns"), other than Tax
Returns of, or that include, TexStar or any of its Affiliates (other than
members of the TexStar Group) or the T2 LaSalle Entities (the "Excluded
Returns"). The Post-Closing Returns shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, be prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures and
practices and accounting methods of the applicable Contributed Entity, except
for inconsistencies required by changes in Law or facts. At least 20 days
prior to the due date of any Post-Closing Return (other than any Excluded
Return) that is an income or franchise Tax Return (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Texas franchise tax return), or a reasonable period of
time with respect to a Post-Closing Return that is a non-income or non-
franchise Tax Return, SXE GP shall submit a draft of such Post-Closing Returns
for review and approval (with such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to TexStar and the Southcross Director with
respect to Post-Closing Returns of any member of the TexStar Group. SXE GP
shall consider in good faith any comments made by TexStar and the Southcross
Director, and shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements
regarding such Post-Closing Returns prior to the due date for filing. In the
event that SXE GP, the Southcross Director and TexStar are unable to resolve
any dispute with respect to any such Post-Closing Return at least ten days
prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to
Section 7.13(h), which resolution shall be binding on the Parties. SXE GP
shall timely file or cause to be timely filed all Post-Closing Returns (other
than Excluded Returns) and timely pay, or cause the Contributed Entities to
timely pay, all Taxes shown as due on such Post-Closing Returns, as finalized
pursuant to this Section 7.13(b). With respect to any such Post-Closing
Return, the amount of undisputed Tax due with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax
Period (as



39 determined under Section 7.13(d) with respect to Straddle Periods) shall be
paid to SXE by TexStar at least five Business Days prior to the filing of such
Post-Closing Return. In the event of a dispute with respect to any such Post-
Closing Return, the disputed amounts shall become payable by TexStar to SXE
promptly when such items in dispute are resolved pursuant Section 7.13(h).

(c) Excluded Returns. TexStar shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
submit to SXE GP and the Southcross Director for review and approval (with
such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
drafts of Excluded Returns of the TexStar JV Entities (other than the T2
LaSalle Entities) that are federal income tax returns ("Excluded 1065
Returns"), no later than February 15, 2015. TexStar shall consider in good
faith any written comments made by SXE GP and the Southcross Director, and
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such
Excluded 1065 Returns and finalize such returns no later than March 1, 2015.
In the event that SXE GP, TexStar and the Southcross Director are unable to
resolve any dispute with respect to any such Excluded 1065 Returns by March 1,
2015, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 7.13(h), which
resolution shall be binding on the Parties. TexStar shall prepare or cause to
be prepared, and file or cause to be filed, the Excluded Returns (other than
those of the T2 LaSalle Entities) at its cost and expense and shall remit (or,
in the case of the TexStar JV Entities, cause the relevant TexStar JV Entity
to remit) the Tax shown to be due thereon to the appropriate Tax authority.
With respect to any Excluded Return that is for a Straddle Period, SXE shall
pay to TexStar at least five Business Days prior to the filing of such
Excluded Return, the amount of undisputed Tax due with respect such Excluded
Return that is attributable to a Post-Closing Tax Period (as determined under
Section 7.13(d)). At least 20 days prior to the due date of any Excluded
Return (other than any Excluded 1065 Returns or any Tax Returns of the T2
LaSalle Entities) that is an non-federal income or franchise Tax Return
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Texas franchise tax return), or a
reasonable period of time with respect to a Excluded Return that is a non-
income or non-franchise Tax Return (other than a Tax Return of either of the
T2 LaSalle Entities), TexStar shall submit a draft of such Excluded Returns
for review and approval (with such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to SXE GP and the Southcross Director.
TexStar shall consider in good faith any comments made by SXE GP and the
Southcross Director, and shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
disagreements regarding such Excluded Returns prior to the due date for
filing. In the event that TexStar, SXE GP and the Southcross Director are
unable to resolve any dispute with respect to any such Post-Closing Return at
least ten days prior to the due date for filing, such dispute shall be
resolved pursuant to Section 7.13(h), which resolution shall be binding on the
Parties. In the event of a dispute with respect to any such Excluded Return,
the disputed amounts shall become payable by SXE to TexStar promptly when such
items in dispute are resolved pursuant Section 7.13(h).

(d) Straddle Period Tax Returns. To the extent permissible under applicable
Laws, SXE shall elect to have each taxable period of the Contributed Entities
(other than the TexStar JV Entities) during which the Closing Date occurs end
at the end of the Closing Date (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the TexStar JV Entities to do



40 likewise) and, if such election is not permitted or required in a jurisdiction
such that any of the Contributed Entities is required to file a Tax Return for
a Straddle Period, SXE shall use the following conventions for determining the
amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period: (i) in the case of
property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, the amount
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined by multiplying
the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which
is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes (including income
Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes, withholding Taxes and other transaction
based Taxes), the amount attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined using a "closing of the books methodology." For purposes of clause
(ii), any item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including
amortization and depreciation deductions) shall be allocated to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period by multiplying the amount of such item for the entire
Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, with
such reasonable adjustments as may be necessary to appropriately take the
items into account (e.g., to appropriately reflect the period during which
depreciable property was in service).

(e) Tax Contests. If SXE or any Contributed Entity receives notice of any
deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, inquiry,
suit, dispute or other claim with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxes (a "Tax
Claim"), SXE will cause such entity (or, in the case of any TexStar JV Entity,
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such entity) to notify TexStar in
writing within ten days of receipt of any Tax Claim attributable to a member
of the TexStar Group, but the failure to so notify TexStar will not relieve
TexStar of any liability it may have under Section 8.1(c), except to the
extent TexStar has suffered actual and material prejudice thereby. With
respect to any Tax Claim, the provisions of this Section 7.13(e) and not
Section 9.4 or Section 9.5 shall apply.

With respect to any Tax Claim attributable to a member of the TexStar Group,
TexStar (the "Controlling Person") shall assume and control all claims,
actions, administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences,
investigations or inquiries, suits with any applicable Governmental
Authorities with respect thereto (the "Tax Proceedings"). With respect to any
Tax Claim, the Controlling Person may either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a
refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim
in any permissible manner; provided, however, that (i) SXE (the "Non-
Controlling Person") will be permitted to participate fully in all such Tax
Proceedings at such Person's sole cost and the Controlling Person will consult
with the Non-Controlling Person in the negotiation and settlement of any Tax
Claim, and (ii) the Controlling Person will not, without the written consent
of the Non-Controlling Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, settle or compromise any Tax Claim in any manner; provided, that to
the extent that a Tax Claim relates to a Straddle Period, TexStar and SXE will
jointly have the right to control all Tax Proceedings taken in connection with
any such Tax Claim and such Straddle Period Tax Claim and will not settle or
compromise such Straddle Period Tax Claim without the



41 written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(f) Cooperation on Tax Matters. SXE and TexStar shall (and SXE shall cause the
Contributed Entities to or, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
TexStar JV Entities to) (i) assist in the preparation and timely filing of all
Tax Returns of the Contributed Entities; (ii) assist in any audit or other
proceeding with respect to the Tax Returns or Taxes of the Contributed
Entities (whether or not involving a Tax contest); (iii) make available any
information, records or other documents relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns
of the Contributed Entities (including copies of Tax Returns and related work
papers) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (iv) provide
certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Returns, that are necessary
or appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Tax. SXE
shall not, nor shall it allow the Contributed Entities to, amend any Tax
Return of any of the Contributed Entities for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (or
will use commercially reasonable efforts to preclude the TexStar JV Entities
to) otherwise initiate any other Post-Closing Tax Event without the prior
written consent of TexStar. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall
work together in good faith to procure, no later than January 15, 2015, with
respect to each of the Contributed Entities the following information as of
the Closing Date (i) the tax basis of all assets and the amount of liabilities
of the Contributed Entities; (ii) the amount of tax items under Section 704(c)
of the Code with respect to assets of the Contributed Entities; (iii) any
amounts to be charged to SXE (for example costs, expenses, compensation
awards, and similar items); (iv) Schedule K-1 information for each Contributed
Entity, along with copies of the federal income tax return and reports filed
by each Contributed Entity for the previous year; and (v) to the extent
reasonably available, such other information as SXE may reasonably request in
writing for purposes of complying with its applicable tax reporting
requirements.

(g) Refunds. Any refund of Taxes of the Contributed Entities, including any
interest with respect thereto, attributable to any Tax period occurring on or
before the Closing Date (or attributable to the portion of any Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date determined in a manner specified in Section
7.13(d)) shall be for the account of TexStar. If the amount of any such Tax
refund is received by SXE or any of the Contributed Entities, such refund
shall be paid promptly to the appropriate Party consistent with this Section
7.13(g).

(h) Disputes. Any dispute as to any matter covered by this Section 7.13 shall
be resolved by the Independent Auditor, although with respect to any Excluded
1065 Returns, the parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
finalize any disputes with respect to such returns no later than March 1,
2015. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne equally
by SXE and TexStar. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not
resolved prior to due date for filing, such Tax Return shall be filed in the
manner which the Party responsible for filing such Tax Return deems correct
pending such resolution (whereupon, to the extent required, such filed Tax
Return shall be amended).



42 (i) Treatment of Cash Consideration. The Parties agree to treat the Cash
Consideration as reimbursement of pre-formation expenses of TexStar (in
accordance with a schedule of such expenses provided by TexStar within five
days prior to the Closing) for all applicable income tax purposes to the
extent permitted by applicable Law.

(j) Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. The parties shall ensure (and, as
to the TexStar JV Entities, shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure) that any tax sharing or similar agreements to which any Contributed
Entity was or is a party prior to the Closing (other than those solely between
a Contributed Entity and another Contributed Entity) shall be terminated as of
the Closing as to such Contributed Entity, and no Contributed Entity or any
successor thereto shall have any further rights or obligations under any such
agreement, including for prior periods covered by any such agreements.

(k) Tax Indemnity. SXE shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless TexStar (or
any of its Affiliates, other than SXE or its Subsidiaries) from and against
(i) any and all taxes (including any interest, penalties or additions to tax
and any tax sharing payment otherwise due under any tax sharing agreements,
except to the extent that such tax sharing agreement is described in Section
7.13(j)) of SXE, any of its Subsidiaries or any Contributed Entity for any
Post-Closing Tax Period, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any taxes
imposed on TexStar (or any of its Affiliates, other than SXE or its
Subsidiaries) for Post-Closing Tax Period taxes attributable to the income,
assets or operations of SXE, any of its Subsidiaries or any Contributed Entity
on account of TexStar (or any of its Affiliates, other than SXE or its
Subsidiaries) being deemed to be a member of a consolidated, combined or
unitary group with SXE and/or its Subsidiaries or any Contributed Entity; and
(ii) any reasonable out of pocket expenses (e.g., reasonable attorneys' and
accountants fees and expenses) relating to matters covered by the foregoing.

ARTICLE VIII 
TERMINATION

8.1 Grounds for Termination. Subject to Section 8.2, this Agreement may be
terminated at any time before the Closing upon the occurrence of any one or
more of the following:

(a) by the mutual written agreement of the Parties;

(b) by either Party (by giving written notice to the other Party), if the
consummation of the Transactions would violate any final judgment, decree or
order of any Governmental Authority having appropriate jurisdiction enjoining
the consummation of the Transactions;

(c) by either Party (by giving written notice to the other Party), if the
other Party has breached this Agreement in any material respect and such
breach causes any of the conditions to Closing for the other Party not to be
satisfied (or, if before the Closing, is of such a magnitude that it will not
be possible for such condition to be satisfied); provided, however, that in
the case of a breach that is capable of being cured, the breaching Party shall
have until the earlier of (i) the



43 Outside Date and (ii) 30 days following receipt of such notice to attempt to
cure the breach and the termination under this Section 8.1(c) shall not become
effective until the end of such period;

(d) by either Party (by giving written notice to the other Party), if the
Closing has not occurred by September 30, 2014 (the "Outside Date"), through
no breach (including a willful failure to perform an obligation under this
Agreement) of this Agreement by the terminating Party or its Affiliates;
provided, however, that if Section 2.6(a) is the only condition to Closing
that remains unsatisfied or unwaived on the Outside Date (other than those
conditions to be satisfied at Closing), then TexStar and SXE shall each have
the right, in its sole discretion, to extend such date by up to 30 days in one
or more extensions by delivering written notice of such extension(s) to the
other Parties;

(e) by TexStar (by giving written notice to SXE) if there shall have occurred
a Material Adverse Effect on the SXE Group; and

(f) by SXE (by giving written notice to TexStar) if there shall have occurred
a Material Adverse Effect on the TexStar Group.

8.2 Effect of Termination. A Party shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement under Section 8.1 if it is then in material breach of this
Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1,
such termination shall be without liability to any Party, except with respect
to any Party that has intentionally and willfully breached this Agreement and
except that performance of the obligations contained in Section 7.11, this
Section 8.2, Article IX and Article X, and such defined terms in Exhibit A as
may be required to give meaning to such Sections, shall survive termination of
this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement under this Article VIII shall
relieve any Party of liability for breach of this Agreement arising before
such termination.

ARTICLE IX 
INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Indemnification by TexStar. Subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article IX, from and after the Closing, TexStar shall indemnify and hold SXE,

from and against any and all Losses actually incurred by any such Southcross
Indemnitee either directly or indirectly as a result of, arising from or
related to:

(a) any failure of the representations and warranties of TexStar set forth in
Article IV and Article V to be true and correct as of the Closing Date (or, if

earlier date);

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of
TexStar under this Agreement;

all Losses actually incurred by any such TexStar Indemnitee either directly or
indirectly as a result of, arising from or related to:

(a) any failure of the representations and warranties of SXE set forth in
Article VI to be true and correct as of the Closing Date (or, if such
representations and warranties relate to an earlier date, as of such earlier
date); and

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of
SXE or SXE Energy under this Agreement.

9.3 Survival. Regardless of any investigation at any time made by or on behalf
of any Party, each of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing for the applicable period of time set
forth in this Section 9.3 and any and all claims and causes of action for
indemnification under this Article IX arising out of the inaccuracy or breach
of any representation or warranty of a Party must be made before the
termination of the applicable survival period.

(a) All of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Parties contained in this Agreement and any and all claims and causes of
action for indemnification under this Article IX shall survive as follows
(with the date on which the relevant representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement expires pursuant to this Section 9.3 being the "Expiration Date"):

(i) the representations and warranties set forth in (A) Sections 4.1, 4.2,
4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 5.1, 5.2, 5.16, 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.9 and 6.10 shall survive
indefinitely and (B) Sections 5.10 and 5.18 shall survive for a period ending
60 days after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to any
matters or other liabilities that are the subject thereof (together, the
representations and warranties set forth in clauses (A) and (B), except for
those set forth in Section 5.18, the "Fundamental Representations"), and any
covenants or agreements in this Agreement that by their terms are to be
performed after the Closing shall survive until fully discharged; and

(ii) except for the Fundamental Representations and the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.18, all representations and warranties set
forth in Article IV, Article V and Article VI shall survive until the date
that is 12 months after the Closing Date (collectively, the "Non-Fundamental
Representations").

(b) No action for a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein (other than Fundamental Representations, which
survive in accordance with Section 9.3(a)(i)) shall be brought after the
applicable Expiration Date, except for claims of which a Party has received a
Claim Notice before the applicable Expiration Date.





45 9.4 Third Person Claims.

(a) If any Southcross Indemnitee or TexStar Indemnitee (any such Person, an
"Indemnified Party") has received notice or otherwise has knowledge of any
claim by any Person who is not a Party or the commencement of any Proceeding
by such Person who the Indemnified Party believes in good faith has an
indemnifiable claim under this Agreement (a "Third Person Claim"), the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with respect thereto to the
Party obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1 or Section
9.2 (the "Indemnifying Party"); provided, however, that the failure or delay
to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from liability for such Third Person Claim except to the extent that such
failure or delay results in the loss or forfeiture by the Indemnifying Party
of material rights and defenses otherwise available to the Indemnifying Party
with respect to such Third Person Claim or increased indemnification expenses
incurred as a direct result of such failure or delay to so notify. The Claim
Notice shall state the nature and the basis of such Third Person Claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend and settle any such Third
Person Claim, at its own expense and by its own counsel (reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnified Party) if the Indemnifying Party provides written notice to
the Indemnified Party (within five Business Days of its receipt of the Claim
Notice) declaring its intention to defend or settle such Third Person Claim.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party of its intention
to undertake the defense or settlement of such Third Person Claim pursuant to
Section 9.4(a), the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party and its counsel, at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense, in
all commercially reasonable respects in the defense thereof and in any
settlement thereof. Such cooperation shall include furnishing the Indemnifying
Party with any books, records and other information reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Party and in the Indemnified Party's possession or control.
After the Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party of its
intention to undertake the defense or settlement of such Third Person Claim
pursuant to Section 9.4(a), the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
additional legal expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
any defense or settlement of such Third Person Claim; provided, however, that
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its expense, to participate in the
defense of such Third Person Claim and the negotiations of the settlement
thereof.

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Person Claim without the
consent of the Indemnified Party unless the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, and the settlement
thereof imposes no liability or obligation on, and includes a complete release
from liability of, the Indemnified Party and further involves no injunction or
equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party and no limitation on the future
operation of the business, assets or property of the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates.



46 (d) If, upon receiving a Claim Notice with respect to a Third Person Claim,
the Indemnifying Party does not timely undertake to defend such Third Person
Claim, or fails to pursue such defense diligently or is otherwise not entitled
to assume the defense of such Third Person Claim or the Indemnified Party is
otherwise entitled to assume such defense, the Indemnified Party may undertake
such defense through counsel of its choice, at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party may settle such Third Person
Claim, in its discretion, and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for the amount paid in such settlement and any other Losses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith.

9.5 Direct Claims.

(a) If the Indemnified Party asserts the existence of a claim giving rise to
Losses that is not a Third Person Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with respect thereto to the Indemnifying
Party.

(b) A Claim Notice delivered in connection with a Direct Claim shall state
that it is being given pursuant to this Section 9.5 and shall specify the
nature and, if known, the amount of the Losses associated therewith. If the
Indemnifying Party, within 30 days after the receipt of such Claim Notice from
the Indemnified Party, shall not give written notice to the Indemnified Party
stating the Indemnifying Party's intent to contest such Direct Claim, the
Indemnified Party's assertion shall be deemed accepted and the amount of such
Direct Claim shall be deemed a valid Direct Claim.

(c) If, however, the Indemnifying Party contests such Direct Claim by giving
written notice, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for contesting
the Direct Claim, to the Indemnified Party within such 30-day period, then the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in good faith to
reach agreement regarding such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party cannot reach an agreement regarding such Direct Claim within
30 days after the notice contesting such Direct Claim provided by the
Indemnifying Party has been received by the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such Direct Claim, in
which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may
be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the
provisions of this Agreement.

9.6 Basket; Indemnification Cap.



47 (a) An Indemnifying Party shall not have any obligation to provide
indemnification for Losses arising out of breaches of the Non-Fundamental
Representations ("Covered Losses") except to the extent that the aggregate
amount of all Covered Losses exceeds $2,150,000 (the "Basket") in which case
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this Article IX only for Covered
Losses that exceed the Basket. The Basket shall not be applicable to Losses
arising out of breaches of the Fundamental Representations, Section 5.5(b) or
Section 5.26.

(b) The maximum amount for which a Party may be liable, other than in cases of
knowing and intentional fraud or willful misconduct, in respect of breaches of
any of the Non-Fundamental Representations, shall be limited to an amount
equal to $32,250,000, and in respect of any breaches of the Fundamental
Representations, Section 5.26 or any other covenant or agreement under this
Agreement, shall be limited to an amount equal to $430,000,000.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no maximum amount for which
TexStar may be liable in connection with such Party's breach of Section
5.5(b).

9.7 Calculation of Losses. In calculating amounts payable to any Indemnified
Party for a claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount of any indemnified
Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss for which an
indemnification claim has been made or could be made under any other
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant and shall be computed net of
payments actually recovered by the Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) under
any insurance policy with respect to such Losses.

9.8 Other Limitations.

(a) Waiver of Certain Damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no Party shall be liable for punitive, special, indirect,
exemplary, consequential, remote or speculative damages of any kind or nature
or any damages calculated using diminution of value or any multiple of value
or loss of business reputation or opportunity, regardless of the form of
action through which such damages are sought, except (i) for any such damages
recovered by any Person who is not a Party against an Indemnified Party in
respect of which such Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to the terms hereof and (ii) in the case of
consequential damages to an Indemnified Party arising from knowing and
intentional fraud or willful misconduct.

(b) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, other than the indemnity contained in Section 7.13
and in the event of knowing and intentional fraud, the indemnification rights
set forth in this Article IX, all of which are subject to the terms,
limitations and restrictions of this Article IX, shall be the sole and
exclusive legal remedy of the Parties from and after Closing for any and all
claims arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Transactions,
including claims based on any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant,
or agreement under this Agreement, and no Person will have any other
entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, it
being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are
expressly waived and released by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted
by Law. This Article IX shall not govern the remedies available under any
other Operative Document to which a Party is party and nothing contained in
this Agreement shall limit the ability of any Party (or any of its Affiliates
party thereto) to pursue any remedy under the Operative



48 Documents (excluding this Agreement). Subject to the rights of the parties to
the SXE Commitment Letter under the terms thereof, none of the Parties, nor or
any of their respective affiliates, shall have any rights or claims against
the Debt Financing Sources in connection with the SXE Credit Facility
described in the SXE Commitment Letter, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise.

(c) For purposes of determining whether a representation or warranty has been
breached for purposes of this Article IX and determining the amount of Losses
suffered by any TexStar Indemnitee or Southcross Indemnitee, as the case may
be, each representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement, and any
qualification with respect to any representation or warranty set forth in the
Schedules, shall be read without regard or giving effect to any "material,"
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications that may be
contained in any such representation or warranty.

ARTICLE X 
MISCELLANEOUS

10.1 Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Texas, without giving effect to any
conflicts of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Texas or any other

other than the State of Texas.

(b) The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of Texas and the federal courts of the United States of America
located in Dallas, Texas, and appropriate appellate courts therefrom, over any

Transactions, and each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect of such dispute or Proceeding may be heard and determined in such
courts. The Parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum
for the maintenance of such dispute. Each Party agrees that a judgment in any
such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by Law. This consent to jurisdiction is being
given solely for purposes of this Agreement and is not intended to, and shall
not, confer consent to jurisdiction with respect to any other dispute in which
a Party to this Agreement may become involved. Each Party consents to process
being served by any other Party to this Agreement in any Proceeding of the
nature specified in this Section 10.1(b) by the mailing of a copy thereof in

LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF.



49 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.1 to the contrary, each of the
Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any action or proceeding
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any
Commitment Party (as defined in the SXE Commitment Letter), any Lender (as
defined in the SXE Commitment Letter), any affiliate of a Commitment Party or
a Lender or any other Person that has committed to provide or otherwise
entered into agreements in connection with the SXE Commitment Letter or the
financings related thereto in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (each such Person, a "Debt Financing Source", and, collectively, the
"Debt Financing Sources") in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the SXE Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). The provisions
of the foregoing sentence in this Section 10.1(d) shall be enforceable by each
Debt Financing Source, its affiliates and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

10.2 Third-Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall provide any
benefit to any third Person or entitle any third Person to any claim, cause of
action, remedy or right of any kind, it being the intent of the Parties that
this Agreement shall not be construed as a third-party beneficiary contract;
provided, however, that the indemnification provisions of Article IX shall
inure to the benefit of the Southcross Indemnitees and the TexStar Indemnitees
as provided therein; provided that each of the Debt Financing Sources are
third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement with respect to the provisions in
this Section 10.2 and provisions in Sections 9.8, 10.1 and 10.6 of this
Contribution Agreement regarding venue, jury waiver, recourse and amendment of
this Contribution Agreement to the extent related to the Debt Financing
Sources.

10.3 No Partnership. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a joint
venture or partnership between or among the Parties or constitute any Party as
agent or attorney of any other Party for any purpose whatever, and, except as
expressly provided for in this Agreement, no Party shall have authority or
power to bind any other Party or to contract in the name of or create
liability against any other Party in any way or for any purpose, except as
expressly authorized in writing by one Party in favor of another Party from
time to time.

10.4 Assignment. No Party may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

10.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Operative Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement collectively constitute the sole understanding of
the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided, however, that
this provision is not intended to abrogate any other written agreement between
or among the Parties executed before or with this Agreement that relates to
any subject matter other than the Transactions.

10.6 Amendment. This Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented
by an instrument in writing signed by the Parties. Further, the Parties shall
not amend the provisions



50 in this Section 10.6 or in Sections 9.8, 10.1 or 10.2 of this Agreement in a
manner that is adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the Debt
Financing Sources' prior written consent.

or privilege.

10.9 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be declared judicially
to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not have the effect
of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, it being the
intent and agreement of the Parties that this Agreement shall be deemed
amended to modify such provision to the extent necessary to render it valid,
legal and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if such modification is
not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is valid, legal
and enforceable and that achieves the same objective.

10.10 Conspicuousness of Provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that

Person's or any of its Affiliates' offices.

10.12 Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original instrument, but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. A Party's
delivery of an executed counterpart signature page by facsimile or Email
transmission is as effective as executing and delivering this Agreement in the
presence of the other Parties. No Party shall be bound until such time as all
of the Parties have executed this Agreement (or counterparts hereof).

represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and that it
has executed the same upon the advice of such independent counsel. Each Party
and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not be construed
against any Party by reason of its preparation. Therefore, the Parties waive
the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document.

10.14 Time of the Essence. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth
or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.
