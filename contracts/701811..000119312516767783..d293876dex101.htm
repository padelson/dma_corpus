(&#147;<B>Siemens Parent</B>&#148;) is the ultimate parent of Siemens Industry, Inc. (&#147;<B>Siemens Industry</B>&#148;). Siemens Parent takes notice of the merger agreement to be signed by and among Siemens Industry, Meadowlark Subsidiary
Corporation (&#147;<B>Merger Subsidiary</B>&#148;) and Mentor Graphics Corporation (&#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;) on November 12, 2016 (the &#147;<B>Merger Agreement</B>&#148;). As an Inducement for Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, Siemens
Parent is providing this Parent Company Guarantee (as herein defined), in respect of which Company has provided consideration to Siemens Parent in the amount of one euro (<B>1&#128;</B>), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by Siemens Parent.
All capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the same meaning as ascribed to it in the Merger Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In accordance with the
foregoing, Siemens Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) guarantees to Company the full and complete discharge and performance of all obligations and liabilities of Siemens Industry and Merger Subsidiary pursuant to the Merger Agreement
(the &#147;<B>Guaranteed Obligations</B>&#148;) and (b)&nbsp;agrees that it shall provide all support and funds necessary in connection with the foregoing and it shall cause all its Affiliates to honor the satisfaction thereof (collectively, the
&#147;<B>Parent Company Guarantee</B>&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Company agrees that, with respect to any obligation or liability of Siemens Industry pursuant to or in
respect of the Merger Agreement, Company shall pursue its remedies in the first instance against Siemens Industry; provided that, at Company&#146;s option, it may elect, at any time after the 30th day following notice to Siemens Industry of its
pursuit of any remedy, to seek satisfaction of any such obligation or liability directly against Siemens Parent pursuant to this Parent Company Guarantee (and, for the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no requirement that Company pursue its
remedies against Siemens Industry for any other minimum period of time before seeking satisfaction of such obligation or liability from Siemens Parent). Company agrees </P>

Siemens Parent, in its own discretion. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Save only as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, Company shall not be obliged, before taking steps to

the Siemens Industry in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations. The liability of Siemens Parent under this Parent Company Guarantee shall not be reduced, discharged or otherwise adversely affected by: (a)&nbsp;any Intermediate payment, settlement of
account or discharge in whole or in part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (b)&nbsp;any variation, extension, discharge, compromise, dealing with, exchange or renewal of any right or remedy which Company may now or after the date of this Parent Company
Guarantee have from or against any of Siemens Industry and any other person in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations; (c)&nbsp;any act or omission by Company or any other person in taking up, perfecting or enforcing any security, indemnity or
guarantee from or against Siemens Industry or any other person; (d)&nbsp;any termination, amendment, variation, novation, replacement or supplement of or to any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (e)&nbsp;any grant of time, indulgence, waiver or
concession to Siemens Industry or any other person; (f)&nbsp;any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, administration, winding up, incapacity, limitation, disability, the discharge by operation of law, or any change in the constitution, name or style
of Siemens Industry or any other person; (g)&nbsp;any invalidity, illegality, unenforceability, irregularity or frustration of any actual or purported obligation of, or security held from, Siemens Industry or any other person in connection with the
Guaranteed Obligations; (h)&nbsp;any claim or enforcement of payment from Siemens Industry or any other person; or (i)&nbsp;any act or omission which would not have discharged or affected the liability of Siemens Parent had it been a principal
debtor instead of a guarantor, or indemnifier or by anything done or omitted by any person which but for this provision might operate to exonerate or discharge Siemens Parent or otherwise reduce or extinguish its liability under this Parent Company
Guarantee. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any release, discharge or settlement between Siemens Parent and Company in relation to this Parent Company Guarantee shall be conditional on
no right, security, disposition or payment to Company by Siemens Parent, Siemens Industry or any other person in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations being avoided, set aside or ordered to be refunded under any enactment or law relating to breach
of duty by any person, bankruptcy, liquidation, administration, protection from creditors generally or insolvency or for any other reason. If any right, security, disposition or payment referred to in the preceding sentence is avoided, reduced, set
aside or ordered to be refunded, Company shall be entitled subsequently to enforce this Parent Company Guarantee against Siemens Parent as if such release, discharge or settlement had not occurred and any such right, security, disposition or payment
had not been given or made. </P>
