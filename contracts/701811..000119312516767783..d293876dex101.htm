_Support Letter_

 

Dear Dr. Rhines,

Siemens Aktiengesellschaft ("Siemens Parent") is the ultimate parent of
Siemens Industry, Inc. ("Siemens Industry"). Siemens Parent takes notice of
the merger agreement to be signed by and among Siemens Industry, Meadowlark
Subsidiary Corporation ("Merger Subsidiary") and Mentor Graphics Corporation
("Company") on November 12, 2016 (the "Merger Agreement"). As an Inducement
for Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, Siemens Parent is providing
this Parent Company Guarantee (as herein defined), in respect of which Company
has provided consideration to Siemens Parent in the amount of one euro (1),
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged by Siemens Parent. All capitalized
terms used and not defined herein shall have the same meaning as ascribed to
it in the Merger Agreement.

In accordance with the foregoing, Siemens Parent hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) guarantees to Company the full and complete discharge and
performance of all obligations and liabilities of Siemens Industry and Merger
Subsidiary pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the "Guaranteed Obligations")
and (b) agrees that it shall provide all support and funds necessary in
connection with the foregoing and it shall cause all its Affiliates to honor
the satisfaction thereof (collectively, the "Parent Company Guarantee").

Company agrees that, with respect to any obligation or liability of Siemens
Industry pursuant to or in respect of the Merger Agreement, Company shall
pursue its remedies in the first instance against Siemens Industry; provided
that, at Companys option, it may elect, at any time after the 30th day
following notice to Siemens Industry of its pursuit of any remedy, to seek
satisfaction of any such obligation or liability directly against Siemens
Parent pursuant to this Parent Company Guarantee (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, there shall be no requirement that Company pursue its remedies against
Siemens Industry for any other minimum period of time before seeking
satisfaction of such obligation or liability from Siemens Parent). Company
agrees  that Siemens Parent shall be entitled to satisfy any liabilities or
obligations pursuant to the Merger Agreement to Company through and on behalf
of Siemens Industry, rather than directly through Siemens Parent, in its own
discretion.

Save only as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, Company shall
not be obliged, before taking steps to enforce any of its rights and remedies
under this Parent Company Guarantee, to: (a) take any action or obtain
judgment in any court against Siemens Industry or any other person; (b) make
or file any claim in a bankruptcy, liquidation, administration or insolvency
of Siemens Industry or any other person; or (c) make demand, enforce or seek
to enforce any claim, right or remedy against Siemens Industry or any other
person.

 

This Parent Company Guarantee is and shall at all times be a continuing
security and shall cover the ultimate balance from time to time owing to
Company by the Siemens Industry in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations. The
liability of Siemens Parent under this Parent Company Guarantee shall not be
reduced, discharged or otherwise adversely affected by: (a) any Intermediate
payment, settlement of account or discharge in whole or in part of the
Guaranteed Obligations; (b) any variation, extension, discharge, compromise,
dealing with, exchange or renewal of any right or remedy which Company may now
or after the date of this Parent Company Guarantee have from or against any
of Siemens Industry and any other person in connection with the Guaranteed
Obligations; (c) any act or omission by Company or any other person in taking
up, perfecting or enforcing any security, indemnity or guarantee from or
against Siemens Industry or any other person; (d) any termination, amendment,
variation, novation, replacement or supplement of or to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (e) any grant of time, indulgence, waiver or concession to
Siemens Industry or any other person; (f) any insolvency, bankruptcy,
liquidation, administration, winding up, incapacity, limitation, disability,
the discharge by operation of law, or any change in the constitution, name or
style of Siemens Industry or any other person; (g) any invalidity,
illegality, unenforceability, irregularity or frustration of any actual or
purported obligation of, or security held from, Siemens Industry or any other
person in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations; (h) any claim or
enforcement of payment from Siemens Industry or any other person; or (i) any
act or omission which would not have discharged or affected the liability of
Siemens Parent had it been a principal debtor instead of a guarantor, or
indemnifier or by anything done or omitted by any person which but for this
provision might operate to exonerate or discharge Siemens Parent or otherwise
reduce or extinguish its liability under this Parent Company Guarantee.

Any release, discharge or settlement between Siemens Parent and Company in
relation to this Parent Company Guarantee shall be conditional on no right,
security, disposition or payment to Company by Siemens Parent, Siemens
Industry or any other person in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations being
avoided, set aside or ordered to be refunded under any enactment or law
relating to breach of duty by any person, bankruptcy, liquidation,
administration, protection from creditors generally or insolvency or for any
other reason. If any right, security, disposition or payment referred to in
the preceding sentence is avoided, reduced, set aside or ordered to be
refunded, Company shall be entitled subsequently to enforce this Parent
Company Guarantee against Siemens Parent as if such release, discharge or
settlement had not occurred and any such right, security, disposition or
payment had not been given or made. No persons other than Company and its successors and permitted assigns shall
be entitled to any rights under this Parent Company Guarantee.

Siemens Parent hereby agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid to
Company without set-off or counterclaim in immediately available funds
denominated in U.S. Dollars at the address specified in writing by Company
from time to time.

Siemens Parent shall be entitled to any and all defenses that Siemens
Industry has except with respect to statute of limitations to the extent
actually impacted by the 30-day notice period contemplated herein.

 

None of the terms or provisions of this Parent Company Guarantee may be
waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a written
instrument executed by Siemens Parent and Company. This Parent Company
Guarantee shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Siemens Parent
and shall inure to the benefit of Company and its successors and assigns. This
Parent Company Guarantee and the obligations hereunder shall not be
assignable by Siemens Parent nor Company without the written consent of the
respective other Party.

This Parent Company Guarantee shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of England and Wales. Each party irrevocably agrees
that the courts of England and Wales shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction to
settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Parent
Company Guarantee or its subject matter or formation (including non-
contractual disputes or claims). Siemens Parent irrevocably appoint Siemens
plc, Sir William Siemens Square, Frimley, Camberley GU16 8QD as its agent to
receive on its behalf in England or Wales service of any proceedings under
this paragraph and agrees that if for any reason such agent ceases to be able
to act as agent or no longer has an address in England or Wales, it will
forthwith appoint a substitute acceptable to Company and deliver to Company
the new agents name and address in England and Wales.

 

Company shall in no case have the right to receive payments in excess of any
payment due and payable or that would become due and payable under the
Merger Agreement. In any event, Company shall not have more rights than if
Siemens Parent were the sole party of the Merger Agreement.
