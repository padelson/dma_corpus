Dated as of January 7, 2013

















This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") contains representations
and warranties that athenahealth, Inc., Epocrates, Inc. and Echo Merger Sub,
Inc. made to one another. These representations and warranties were made only
for the purposes of the Agreement and solely for the benefit of athenahealth
and Epocrates as of specific dates, may be subject to important limitations
and qualifications agreed to by athenahealth and Epocrates and included in
confidential disclosure schedules provided by Epocrates to athenahealth in
connection with the signing of the Agreement, and may not be complete.
Furthermore, these representations and warranties may have been made for the
purposes of allocating contractual risk between athenahealth and Epocrates

accurate as of any specific date and do not purport to be accurate as of the
date of the filing of the Agreement by athenahealth with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the
representations and warranties contained in the Agreement as characterizations
of the actual state of facts, since they were intended to be for the benefit
of, and to be limited to, athenahealth and Epocrates.

among athenahealth, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Echo Merger Sub,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and Epocrates, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"), Parent and the Company will enter into a business combination
transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company
(the "Merger");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has (i)
determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and its stockholders and has approved and adopted this Agreement and
declared its advisability and approved the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) has recommended the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent (the "Parent Board") has determined
that the Merger is consistent with and in furtherance of the long-term
business strategy of Parent and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent
and its stockholders and has approved and adopted this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to Parent entering into this
Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company have entered into
Voting Agreements, dated as of the date hereof (the "Voting Agreements"),
providing that, among other things, such stockholders will vote their shares
of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

SECTION 1.01 The Merger.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII, and in
accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02),
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). SECTION 1.02 Effective Time; Closing.

The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 5:30 a.m.,
Pacific time, on a date to be specified by the parties hereto, which shall be
no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Cooley LLP, 3175 Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California, unless
another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The
date on which the Closing is to take place is referred to in this Agreement as
the "Closing Date." At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger
to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as
is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL (the date and time of such filing of the Certificate of Merger (or
such later time as may be agreed by each of the parties hereto and specified
in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time").

SECTION 1.03 Effect of the Merger.

At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.04 Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws.

a.At the Effective Time, subject and giving effect to Section 6.06(a), the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate
of Incorporation.

b.Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, and
subject and giving effect to Section 6.06(a), at the Effective Time, the
By‑laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the By‑laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
and such By‑laws.

SECTION 1.05 Directors and Officers.

The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation,
respectively, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and By‑laws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until the earlier of
their death, resignation or removal. ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.01 Conversion of Securities.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following
securities:

a. each share of Company Common Stock (all issued and outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and any
Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined)) shall be cancelled and shall be
converted automatically, subject to Section 2.02, into the right to receive
$11.75 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), payable upon
surrender of the documents described in Section 2.02, in the manner provided
in Section 2.02;

b. each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made
with respect thereto; and

c.each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 2.02 Exchange of Certificates.

a. Rights of Converted Shares. Each Share converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(a) shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the
Effective Time of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock not represented
by certificates ("Book-Entry Shares") and the holders of certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Shares
("Certificates") shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares
other than the right to receive, upon the surrender of such Certificates or
transfer of such Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 2.02, the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each such Share.

b. Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
Computershare LLC or such other bank or trust company that may be designated
by Parent and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent
(the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, cash
in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to
be paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund"). Except as contemplated by Section 2.02(e) hereof, the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. c. Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who was, at the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Certificates entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
pursuant to Section 2.02(h) hereof) to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. The form and substance of the letter of transmittal and
instructions thereto shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
the Parent and Company may mutually agree. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent
of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to Section
2.02(h) hereof) for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate
pursuant to Section 2.01(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate
representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
surrender the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a). Upon receipt of an "agent\'s message" by
the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of
such Book-Entry Shares shall, without being required to deliver a Certificate
or a completed and executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent, be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which such holder
has the right to receive in respect of the Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
Section 2.01(a), and such Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; provided, however, that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States. Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be placed in
the Exchange Fund and be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
Parent shall determine.

d.No Further Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid upon the surrender
of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares.

e.Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Shares for six months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to Parent for the cash to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).
Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

f.No Liability. None of the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any person in respect of Merger Consideration or other cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

g.Withholding Rights. Each of the Paying Agent, Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as it determines is required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying Agent, Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent,
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

h.Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).

SECTION 2.03 Stock Transfer Books.

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter
on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates representing Shares or Book-Entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares or Book-Entry Shares, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in Section 2.02.

SECTION 2.04 Company Stock Options; Company RSUs.

a. All options (the "Company Stock Options") outstanding, whether or not
exercisable and whether or not vested, at the Effective Time under the 1999
Stock Option Plan, the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, and the 2010 Equity
Incentive Plan, in each case as such may have been amended, supplemented or
modified (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans"), shall remain
outstanding following the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the Company
Stock Options shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent subject
to, and in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and any option agreement
or other document evidencing such Company Stock Option (each, an "Assumed
Option"). From and after the Effective Time, all references to the Company in
the Company Stock Option Plans and the applicable stock option agreements
issued thereunder shall be deemed to refer to Parent, which shall have assumed
the Company Stock Option Plans as of the Effective Time by virtue of this
Agreement and without any further action. Each Assumed Option shall be
exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as under the applicable Company
Stock Plan and the applicable option agreement issued thereunder, except that
(i) each such Assumed Option shall be exercisable for, and represent the right
to acquire, that whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down
to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Conversion Ratio, and (ii) the option price per share of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Assumed Option shall be
determined by dividing the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock
subject to such Assumed Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise
price to the nearest whole cent. It is the intention of the parties hereto
that the assumption by Parent of each Assumed Option pursuant hereto satisfies
the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1 (to the extent such
options were incentive stock options) and of Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and the provisions of this Section 2.04(a) shall be
interpreted and applied consistent with such intention. Such Assumed Options
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions as such Company
Stock Options.

b. All restricted stock unit awards outstanding and unvested at the Effective
Time under the Company Stock Option Plans (the "Company RSUs") shall remain
outstanding after the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the Company RSUs
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed, subject to, and in accordance
with, the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan and any restricted
stock unit agreement or other document evidencing such Company RSU (each, an
"Assumed RSU"). Each Assumed RSU will continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions related to the applicable Assumed RSU (including as
set forth in the restricted stock unit agreement evidencing such Assumed RSU)
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any vesting provisions),
except that each Assumed RSU shall be converted into the right to receive that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (or an amount in cash in respect
thereof for a cash settled Assumed RSU) equal to the product of: (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Assumed RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (ii) the Conversion
Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock.
It is the intention of the parties hereto that the assumption by Parent of
each Assumed RSU pursuant hereto satisfies the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and the provisions of this Section
2.04(b) shall be interpreted and applied consistent with such intention. All
outstanding rights that the Company may hold immediately prior to the
Effective Time with respect to the forfeiture of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to any Assumed RSU described in this Section 2.04(b) shall be
assigned to Parent and shall thereafter be held by Parent upon the same terms
and conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
the shares forfeitable pursuant to such rights shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect the Merger Consideration. c. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than20 business
days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to each holder of an Assumed Option or an Assumed RSU an
appropriate notice setting forth such holder\'s rights pursuant thereto and
such Assumed Option or Assumed RSU shall continue in effect on the same terms
and conditions (including any anti-dilution provisions, and subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.04 after giving effect to the Merger).
Parent shall comply with the terms of all such Assumed Options and Assumed
RSUs and ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of,
the Company Stock Option Plans, that Assumed Options that qualified as
incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective
Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time.
Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a

more than 20 business days) after the Effective Time, the shares of common
stock of the Parent subject to Assumed Options and Assumed RSUs shall be

SECTION 2.05 Dissenting Shares.

a. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the
extent available under the DGCL, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who shall have neither
voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall
have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such Shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.
Such Dissenting Shares shall cease to exist and be converted into and
represent solely the right to receive payment of the appraised value of such
Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262,
except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Shares under such Section 262 shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.02, of
the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares.

b. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. ARTICLE III

SECTION 3.04 Authority Relative to This Agreement; State Takeover Laws.

The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the Merger and any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

Company\'s stockholders of this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are

Stock and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and

its terms (subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to (a) bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the rights and remedies
of creditors generally and (b) general principles of equity). The Company
Board has approved this Agreement and the Transactions and such approvals are

Transactions. No other state takeover statute is applicable to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease, license, permit or franchise or other similar instrument or (iv) result
(or, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would
result) in the creation or imposition of any Lien or other encumbrance on any property or
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, with respect to
clauses "(ii)", "(iii)" and "(iv)", for any such filings, notices, permits,
authorizations, consents, approvals, conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults
or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any United States federal or state or local or foreign government,
regulatory or administrative authority, agency, instrumentality or commission
or any court, tribunal, or judicial or arbitral body (a "Governmental

required by the DGCL and (viii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.07 Permits; Compliance.

a. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Authority necessary for each of the Company or the Subsidiaries to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets or to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where the failure to have, or
the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Company Permits would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, except where the failure to have, or the
suspension or cancellation of, any of the Company Permits would not,

Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company,
including the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, will not (A) require
the Company or any Subsidiary to give notice to, or obtain any consent from,
any person under, (B) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default)
under, or (C) give to others any right of termination, amendment or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on
any property or asset of the Company or any Subsidiary pursuant to, any

aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

either the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did or
will not, at the time they were or are to be filed or furnished, or, if
amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary is
required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC.

b. Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any
notes thereto) contained or to be contained in the Company SEC Reports was
(or, for future filings, will be) prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent

individually or in the aggregate, a materially adverse effect on the financial
statements).

disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15
under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures are designed to provide
reasonable assurances that all material information concerning the Company and
its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Company\'s SEC filings and other public
disclosure documents. No executive officer of the Company has failed to make
any of the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of

in all material respects with all provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to
which it is subject and neither the Company nor any member of the Company
Board has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any substantive
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, of the

conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with management\'s general or specific
authorization and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with

reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP and have disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation, to the
Company\'s outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board, (A)
any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Company\'s ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves sales or management. h. Since February 1, 2011, none of the Company, any Subsidiary, or any

claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective
internal accounting controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that the Company or any Subsidiary has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices. No current or former attorney representing

against an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary in the terms and
conditions of employment because of any act of such employee described in 18
U.S.C. § 1514A(a).

j.All accounts receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries reflected on the
2012 Balance Sheet or arising thereafter have arisen from bona fide
transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices
and in accordance with SEC regulations and GAAP applied on a consistent basis
and are not subject to valid defenses, setoffs or counterclaims. The
Company\'s reserve for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts is
adequate and has been calculated in a manner consistent with past practices.
Since the date of the 2012 Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has modified or changed in any material respect its sales
practices or methods including, without limitation, such practices or methods
in accordance with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries sell goods,

true and complete copy of each Plan and has delivered to Parent a true and
complete copy of each material document, if any, prepared in connection with
each such Plan, including, without limitation, (i) a copy of each trust or
other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary plan description and summary of
material modifications, (iii) the most recently filed Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") Form 5500, (iv) the most recently received IRS determination letter for each such Plan, and (v) the most
recently prepared actuarial report and financial statement in connection with
each such Plan. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any express or
implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, (i) to create, incur
liability with respect to or cause to exist any other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement, (ii) to enter into any contract or agreement to
provide compensation or benefits to any individual, or (iii) to modify, change
or terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or
termination required by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law.

b. None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a single employer
pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which
the Company or any Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064
of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). None of the Plans (i) provides for the
payment of separation, severance, termination or similar‑type benefits to any
person, (ii) obligates the Company or any Subsidiary to pay separation,
severance, termination or similar‑type benefits solely or partially as a
result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) obligates the
Company or any Subsidiary to make any payment or provide any benefit as a
result of a "change in the ownership or effective control," within the meaning
of such term under Section 280G of the Code or (iv) provides for any tax
"gross-up" or similar "make-whole" payments to any employee, director or
consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary. None of the Plans provides for or
promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any current
or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary,
except as required by applicable law. No Plan provides health or disability
benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance contract. Each of the
Plans is subject only to the Laws of the United States or a political
subdivision thereof.

c. Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. The Company and the
Subsidiaries have performed in all material respects all obligations required
to be performed by them under, are not in any respect in default under or in
violation of, and have no knowledge of any default or violation by any party
to, any Plan. No Action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course) and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists
that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Action.

d. Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions applicable to the Plan for
which determination letters are currently available that the Plan is so
qualified and each trust established in connection with any Plan which is
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code has received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt,
and , to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has occurred since the
date of such determination letter or letters from the IRS to adversely affect
the qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

e. There has not been any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Plan.
Neither the Company nor entity that would have ever been considered a single employer with
the Company under Section 4001(b) of ERISA or part of the same "controlled
group" as the Company for purposes of Section 302(d)(3) of ERISA (each, an
"ERISA Affiliate") has ever incurred any liability under, arising out of or by
operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course),
including, without limitation, any liability in connection with (i) the
termination or reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA, or (ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any such liability.

f. All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect to
any Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All such contributions
have been fully deducted for income tax purposes and no such deduction has
been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority and no fact or
event exists which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such
challenge or disallowance.

g. All directors, officers, management employees, and technical and
professional employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries are under written
obligation to the Company and the Subsidiaries to maintain in confidence all
confidential or proprietary information acquired by them in the course of
their employment and to assign to the Company and the Subsidiaries all
inventions made by them within the scope of their employment during such
employment and for a reasonable period thereafter.

h. Each Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated and
maintained in all material respects in operational and documentary compliance
with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder.

i. No Plan, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of
any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code
or any other provision of the Code or any similar foreign law, as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement alone or together with any
other event.

j. In addition to the foregoing, with respect to each Plan that is not subject
to United States law (a "Non-U.S. Benefit Plan"):

i.all employer and employee contributions to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
required by law or by the terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been made,
or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with normal accounting practices, and
a pro rata contribution for the period prior to and including the date of this
Agreement has been made or accrued;

ii.the fair market value of the assets of each funded Non-U.S. Benefit Plan,
the liability of each insurer for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the benefits determined on any ongoing basis (actual or contingent)
accrued to the date of this Agreement with respect to all current and former
participants under such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, and no Transaction shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations; and

iii.each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered
and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities. Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan is now and always has been operated in
full compliance with all applicable non‑United States laws.

threatened between the Company or any Subsidiary and any of their respective
employees; (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract, or work rules

SECTION 3.18 Taxes.

a. The Company and the Subsidiaries have timely filed all material United
States federal, state, local and non-United States Tax Returns and reports
required to be filed by them and have paid and discharged all Taxes required
to be paid or discharged (whether or not shown on any Tax Return), other than
such Taxes the non-payment of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All such Tax Returns are
true, accurate and complete in all material respects and were prepared in
substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Section
3.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all material United States
federal, state, local, and non-U.S. income Tax Returns filed with respect to
any of the Company or its Subsidiaries for taxable periods ended on or after
December 31, 2009, indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited, and
indicates those Tax Returns that currently are the subject of audit and with
respect to which, to the knowledge of the Company, an audit has been
threatened. The Company has delivered to Parent correct and complete copies of
all federal income Tax Returns, examination reports, and statements of
deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries filed or received since December 31, 2009. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return. No written claim has ever been made
by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
does not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or
may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld
and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party, other
than any such Taxes for which the failure to withhold and pay over would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the IRS nor any other United States or non-United States taxing
authority or agency is now asserting or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatening to assert against the Company or any Subsidiary any deficiency or
claim for any material amount of Taxes or interest thereon or penalties in
connection therewith. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has granted any
waiver of any statute of limitations with respect to, or any extension of a
period for the assessment of, any Tax. The accruals and reserves for Taxes
reflected in the 2012 Balance Sheet are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable
through such date (including interest and penalties, if any, thereon) in
accordance with GAAP, other than such Taxes the non-payment of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
There are no Tax liens upon any property or assets of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries except liens for current Taxes not yet due. Neither the
Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has been required to include in income any
adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by reason of a voluntary change
in accounting method initiated by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, and
the IRS has not initiated or proposed any such adjustment or change in
accounting method, in either case which adjustment or change would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(e) of the Code within the
past five years. b. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that has resulted or could result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of (i) any "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Code §280G (or any corresponding provision of
state, local, or non-U.S. Tax law) and (ii) any amount that will not be fully
deductible as a result of Code §162(m) (or any corresponding provision of
state, local, or non-U.S. Tax law). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been a United States real property holding corporation within
the meaning of Code §897(c)(2) during the applicable period specified in Code
§897(c)(1)(A)(ii). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has
been a party to any "reportable transaction," as defined in Code §6707A(c)(1)
and Reg. §1.6011-4(b). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries have disclosed
on their federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could
give rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the
meaning of Code §6662\. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or bound by any Tax allocation or sharing agreement, other than any
such agreement to which only the Company and any of its Subsidiaries are
parties. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member
of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other
than a group the common parent of which was the Company) or (B) has any
Liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) under Reg. §1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local,
or non-U.S. law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

c. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include
any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction
from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after
the Closing Date as a result of any:

i.change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date;

ii."closing agreement" as described in Code §7121 (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax law) executed on or
prior to the Closing Date;

iii.intercompany transaction or excess loss account described in Treasury
Regulations under Code §1502 (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local, or non-U.S. income Tax law);

SECTION 6.02 Company Stockholders\' Meeting.

The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the fifth business day immediately following the date of
the public announcement of the execution of this Agreement) for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders, which meeting
the Company shall cause to occur as soon as commercially practicable (taking
into account applicable Law and desirable time for solicitation of votes) but
in any event within 35 days following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the extent practicable taking into account applicable Law (and taking into
account any instruction and/or advice provided by the SEC), such date to be
selected after consulting with Parent (the "Company Stockholders\' Meeting"),
for the purpose of voting upon the approval and adoption of this Agreement;
provided, however, that (a) if the Company is unable to obtain a quorum of its

Stockholders\' Meeting by no more than ten business days and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts during such ten business day period to
obtain such a quorum as soon as practicable and (b) the Company shall not,

the Shares that they adopt and approve this Agreement, and shall include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section
6.02 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company or any other person of any
Competing Transaction. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the required vote or consent of

Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; and (ii) furnish promptly
to Parent such information concerning the business, properties, contracts,
assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of such party and its
subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request, except

Transaction that did not result from a breach of Section 6.04, or (y)
materials prepared in connection with the Company Board\'s consideration of
the Transactions (unless otherwise required to be furnished pursuant to this
Agreement or applicable Law); provided, however, that the Company shall have
no obligation to provide such access or furnish such information to the extent
it may result in the loss of attorney-client privilege. The parties hereto
will use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

kept confidential in accordance with that certain confidentiality letter
agreement, dated August 30, 2012, between Parent and the Company (the

c.No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

SECTION 6.04 No Solicitation of Transactions.

a.The Company agrees that neither it nor any Subsidiary nor any of the
directors or officers of it or any Subsidiary will, and that it will cause its
and its Subsidiaries\' agents, advisors and other representatives (including,
without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by
it or any Subsidiary), not to, and shall not authorize or permit its employees
to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information or
assistance), or take any other action intended to induce or facilitate, any
inquiries with respect to, or the making of any indication of interest,
proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any indication of interest,
proposal or offer to its stockholders) that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Competing Transaction (as defined below); (ii) enter
into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with any person or
entity in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer for a
Competing Transaction; (iii) agree to, approve, endorse or recommend any
Competing Transaction or enter into any letter of intent or other contract,
agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to or reasonably likely to lead
to any Competing Transaction (except for a confidentiality agreement as
contemplated by Section 6.04(b)(A)(iii)) or enter into any contract,
arrangement or agreement in principal requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other Transaction
contemplated by this Agreement or resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing; (iv) terminate, amend, waive or fail to use commercially reasonable
efforts to enforce any rights under any "standstill" or other similar
agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any person, or
(v) authorize or permit any of the officers, directors or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, to take any such action (the obligations described
in the foregoing clauses "(i)" through "(iii)" and the foregoing clause "(v)"
(as it relates to the foregoing clauses "(i)" through "(iii)") shall be
referred to herein collectively as the "Specified No Solicitation
Obligations"). The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within twenty-four hours after the Company attains knowledge
thereof if such knowledge is obtained in writing or one business day if such
knowledge is obtained in any other manner), orally and in writing, if any
proposal or offer, or any inquiry or contact with any person with respect
thereto, regarding a Competing Transaction is made, such notice to include the
identity of the person making any such inquiry, request, proposal or
expression of interest and the material terms and conditions of such inquiry,
request, proposal or expression of interest (including, if in written form, a
copy of such inquiry, request, proposal or expression of interest). The
Company immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to or which would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing
Transaction. The Company shall promptly request each person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring (whether by merger, acquisition of stock or assets
or otherwise) the Company or any Subsidiary, if any, to return (or if
permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf
of the Company or any Subsidiary. Any violation of this Section 6.04 by any
representative of the Company, or by any Subsidiary or representative of any
Subsidiary of the Company, shall constitute a breach hereof by the Company.
For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that a representative of the Company has
referred a third party to a publicly filed copy of this Agreement, without
more, shall not in itself be deemed a breach of the Specified No Solicitation
Obligations.

b.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, from the date
hereof and prior to the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, the Company Board may
furnish information to, and enter into discussions and negotiations with, a
person who has made an unsolicited, written, bona fide proposal or offer
regarding a Competing Transaction (a "Qualified Bidder") if, and only if, (A)
such proposal or offer did not result from a breach of the provisions of this
Section 6.04; (B) the Company Board has (i) determined, in its good faith
judgment (after having received the advice of a financial advisor of
internationally recognized reputation), that such proposal or offer
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as
defined below) and the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that, the failure of the Company
Board to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Board\'s
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) provided written notice to Parent
of its intent to furnish information or enter into discussions and
negotiations with such Qualified Bidder at least one business day prior to
taking any such action and shall provide Parent with at least forty-eight hours prior written notice
(or such shorter period of time as given to the members of the Company Board)
of any meeting of the Company Board or any committee thereof at which the
Company Board or such committee is expected to consider any Competing
Transaction; and (iii) obtained from such Qualified Bidder (if one does not
already exist) an executed confidentiality agreement (the terms of which are
no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement) and (C) the Company simultaneously provides or makes available to
Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided or made available to such Qualified Bidder which was not previously
provided or made available to Parent. The Company shall update the Parent as
to any material developments with respect to such discussions and
negotiations.

c.Except as set forth in this Section 6.04(c) or in Section 6.04(d), neither
the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall make a Change in the Company
Recommendation or approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company to
enter into any letter of intent, or other contract, agreement or obligation
with respect to, any Competing Transaction (other than a confidentiality
agreement contemplated by subsection (b)(A)(iii) of this Section 6.04).
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained elsewhere
in this Agreement, at any time prior to the time of the Company Stockholders\'
Meeting, the Company may make a Change in the Company Recommendation and
thereafter may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(v) and,
concurrently with such termination may enter into a definitive agreement to
execute a Superior Proposal, only if: (i) a Superior Proposal is made and such
Superior Proposal did not result from a breach by the Company of this Section
6.04; (ii) the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment after
consultation with independent legal counsel (who may be the Company\'s
regularly engaged independent legal counsel), that failure to make a Change in
the Company Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal and terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(v) or enter into a definitive
agreement to execute a Superior Proposal, would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the Company and its stockholders under applicable
Law, (iii) the Company Board provided written notice to Parent (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") advising Parent that the Company Board has received a
Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal and
indicating that the Company Board intends to make a Change in the Company
Recommendation, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(v) or
enter into a definitive agreement to execute a Superior Proposal, and, if so,
which actions and the manner in which it intends to do so, (iv) if Parent does
not, within five business days of Parent\'s receipt of the Notice of Superior
Proposal (the "Response Window"), make an offer or a counteroffer that the
Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after having received
the advice of a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation) to
be at least as favorable to the Company\'s stockholders as such Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material amendments to such
Superior Proposal, including the financial terms of such Superior Proposal,
shall each require the delivery of a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the
commencement of a new Response Window, but such Response Window shall be for a
period of three business days) and (v) the Company pays the Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 8.03 to Parent prior to or concurrently with terminating
this Agreement.

d.Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained
elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the time of the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting, the Company may make a Change in the Company Recommendation (other
than due to a proposal for a Competing Transaction, which is governed by
Section 6.04(c) above) in response to or as a result of a material event,
material development or material change in circumstances that does not relate
to any Competing Transaction and that was not known or reasonably foreseeable
by the Company Board on the date of this Agreement, occurring or arising after
the date of this Agreement (or if known or foreseeable, the consequences of
which are not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of
the date hereof), which event, development or change in circumstance, or any
material consequences thereof, becomes known to the Company Board prior to the
time of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (any such material event, material
development or material change in circumstances unrelated to a Competing
Transaction being referred to as an "Intervening Event"), but only if: (i) no
member of the Company Board had knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement,
that such Intervening Event was reasonably likely to occur or arise after the
date of this Agreement (or if known or foreseeable, the consequences of which
are not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date
hereof); (ii) the Company Board provided Parent at least five business days
advance written notice prior to making such Change in the Company
Recommendation providing reasonable details of the Intervening Event and
advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make a Change in the Company
Recommendation; and (iii) prior to any Change in the Company Recommendation,
the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after having
received the advice of a financial advisor of internationally recognized
reputation) and after taking into account the Parent\'s offers or
counteroffers made during such five business days that failure to make a
Change in the Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company and its stockholders under applicable Law.

e.Nothing in this Section 6.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed
to prohibit the Company from, (x) complying with Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (y)
making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided that: (i) this Section 6.04(e) shall not be deemed to permit the
Company Board to make a Change in the Company Recommendation except, in each
case, to the extent permitted by Section 6.04(c) or Section 6.04(d); and (ii)
nothing in this Section 6.04(e) shall change any disclosure made in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 6.04(e) from being a Change in the Company
Recommendation if such disclosure meets the definition of a Change in the
Company Recommendation.

f.A "Competing Transaction" means any of the following transactions or series
of related transactions (other than the Transactions): (i) any merger, tender
offer, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other disposition of assets that constitute at least 15% of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) any sale,
exchange, transfer or other disposition of 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company; or (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company. 

g.A "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited written bona fide offer or
proposal made by a third party with respect to a Competing Transaction on
terms and conditions that the Company Board determines, in its good faith
judgment, after having received the advice of a financial advisor of
internationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, and taking
into account all legal, financial and regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal (including timing) and any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such offer or proposal or otherwise, to be
more favorable, including from a financial point of view, to the stockholders
of the Company than the Merger and which is reasonably likely to be
consummated. For purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," each
reference to "15%" in the definition of "Competing Transaction" shall be
replaced with "50%".

SECTION 6.05 Employee Benefits Matters.

For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending December 31, 2013,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to maintain
for each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee") employee benefit plans,
programs, arrangements and policies that are comparable in the aggregate to
the employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and policies available to
the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Upon their
transition to any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or policy
established or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries, employees of the Company or any Subsidiary shall receive credit
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit,
vacation, or paid time off accruals) under any such employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the
Effective Time with the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that
such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the
funding of any such benefit. In addition, Parent shall waive, or cause to be
waived, any limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions to
the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of
Parent or its subsidiaries and recognize, for purposes of annual deductible
and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and
out-of-pocket expenses paid by employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

SECTION 6.06 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance.

a.The Certificate of Incorporation and By‑laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification
than are currently set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company and the By‑laws of the Company, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of
individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers,
employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company, unless such modification
shall be required by law.

b.For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors, officers and employees of the Company (the "Indemnified
Persons") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their respective
capacities occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the same extent such
Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to (i) the Company Governing Documents as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and (ii) indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date of this Agreement with any directors, officers or
employees of the Company.

c.The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, in effect for six years from and
after the Effective Time, insurance "tail" or other insurance policies with
respect to directors\' and officers\' liability insurance relating to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, in an amount and scope at least as
favorable as the coverage applicable to directors and officers of the Company
as of the Effective Time; provided, however, that if such "tail" or other
policies are not available at an annual cost not greater than 200% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date hereof under such policy (the "Insurance
Cap"), then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be obtained as much
comparable insurance as can reasonably be obtained in its good faith judgment
at a cost up to but not exceeding the Insurance Cap.

SECTION 6.07 Further Action; Reasonable Efforts.

a.Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall (i) make promptly, and in no event later than ten

applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust and competition Laws with
respect to the Transactions and (ii) promptly use its reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, any and all appropriate action, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Transactions,
including, without limitation, using its reasonable efforts to obtain all
Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of
Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and the
Subsidiaries, to resolve any objections which may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transaction, and to cause all
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and other foreign, federal and
state antitrust and competition Laws to expire or be terminated, as are
necessary for the consummation of the Transactions and to fulfill the
conditions to the Merger and using its reasonable efforts to defend against
any Action that restricts, prevents or prohibits consummations of the
Transactions.

b.In no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be obligated pursuant to this
Agreement to divest or hold separate any assets or to take or commit to take

Parent\'s ownership or operation (or that of any Parent\'s Subsidiaries or
affiliates) of all or a material portion of the Company\'s business or assets.

c.Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and to reasonable restrictions
limiting access to counsel, each party shall promptly (i) notify the other
parties of and provide a copy of any material communication it provides to or
receives from any Governmental Authority relating to any filings, or
submissions, or any investigation, under the HSR Act or other applicable
foreign, federal or state antitrust or competition Laws relating to the

information made in respect of any such filing or investigation. No party
shall withdraw any HSR filing, agree to extend any applicable waiting period,
or agree with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the Transaction for
any period of time, without the consent of the other parties. Any HSR filing
fees shall be paid 50% by the Company and 50% by Parent.

subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

The Company shall, if practicable, provide prior notice to Parent prior to
making publicly available its financial results for any period after the date
of this Agreement and prior to filing any report or document with the SEC
after the date of this Agreement, it being understood (for the avoidance of
doubt) that: (i) Parent\'s consent shall not be required in order to make any
such filings; and (ii) Parent shall have no liability by reason of such
consultation.

SECTION 6.10 Public Announcements.

The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press
release the text of which has been agreed to by each of Parent and the
Company. Thereafter, for so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall either permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement
concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law or the applicable
rules of any stock exchange, in which event such party shall endeavor, on a
basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity
to the other parties and their counsel to review and comment upon such press
release or other announcement and shall in good faith give due consideration
to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto, except
that the Company shall not be required to consult with Parent with respect to
any public statements relating to Change in the Company Recommendation or
Competing Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.10, each of Parent and the Company may make any press release or
public statement with respect to the Transactions to the extent repeating or
affirming disclosure made in any prior press release or public statement
validly made in accordance with this Section 6.10. SECTION 6.11 Financing.

a.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any person
in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of lender under any existing
loan facility of Parent or Merger Sub or provider of any commitment for any
loan facility to Parent or Merger Sub (the "Financing Sources") in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to any commitment letters or any loan agreement related to
any financing, or financing commitment, provided or to be provided by any
Financing Source (any such financing a "Financing" and any such agreement or
commitment a "Facility Commitment") or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New
York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New
York; (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in any Facility
Commitment, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in any
way relating to any Facility Commitment or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
(whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise)
directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to any Facility
Commitment or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby.

b.Prior to the Closing Date, if Parent wishes to borrow cash to fund the
Merger Consideration from a reputable bank, the Company shall, at Parent\'s
sole expense, cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its Representatives (including its legal and accounting
Representatives) to, provide reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the such financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
including without limitation (i) providing reasonable and customary due
diligence materials to the sources of such financing and any rating agencies,
including financial statements and financial and other information, as soon as
reasonably practicable after request therefor, that are reasonably and
customarily required in connection with such financing; (ii) assisting Parent
with the preparation of rating agency presentations and similar documents and
materials in connection with the financing and permitting the use of the
Company name and logo in the offering materials; (iii) participating in a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions in
connection with the financing, (iv) assisting in the preparation of customary
offering materials and private placement memorandum and/or bank information
memorandum with respect to the financing, as may be reasonably requested by
Parent; and (v) facilitating and providing pertinent information for the
pledging of collateral for the financing (the "Required Financial
Information"); provided, that: (1) such requested assistance and cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and does not create undue burden for the operation of the
Company; (2) the Company shall not be required to pay any commitment or other
fee or incur any liability or expense in connection with any financing; (3)
the effectiveness of any documentation executed by the Company shall be
subject to the consummation of the Closing Date; (4) the Company shall not be required
to provide access to or disclose information to any party or entity unless
such person or entity is bound by confidentiality obligations reasonably
satisfactory to the Company; and (5) the Company shall not be required to
provide access to or disclose information where the Company reasonably
determines that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or contravene ant Law or
any contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Required
Financial Information required to be delivered pursuant to this Section
6.11(e) shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, for the absence of footnotes and normal,
recurring year-end adjustments).

c.Parent shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, (i) promptly upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs incurred by the Company in connection with cooperation
provided for in Section 6.11(a) (such reimbursement to be made promptly and in
event within three business days of delivery of reasonably acceptable
documentation evidencing such expenses); and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless
the Company and its Representatives from and against any and all Losses (as
defined below) suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement
of any financing, and any information utilized in connection therewith. All
non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, its affiliates or their respective
Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement. Loss shall mean any include any loss, damage,
injury, liability, claim, demand, settlement, judgment, award, fine, penalty,
tax, fee (including reasonable attorney\'s fees), charge, cost (including cost
of investigation) or expense of any nature.

d.For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to close
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not conditioned upon the
consummation of any financing and, accordingly, the parties agree that a
failure of Parent and Merger Sub to close the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement resulting from a failure or inability to consummate any
financing constitutes a breach for purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding
compliance by Parent with Section 6.11.

SECTION 6.12 Additional Agreements.

In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to the rights, privileges and powers of
any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense
of, Parent.

SECTION 6.13 Rule 16b-3 Actions.

Parent and the Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain those officers and directors of the Company who are subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with
the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that
such persons not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section
6.13. Promptly after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law.

SECTION 6.14 State Takeover Laws.

If any "control share acquisition," "fair price" or other anti-takeover laws
or regulations enacted under state or federal laws becomes or is deemed to
become applicable to the Company, the Merger, the Voting Agreements or any
other transaction contemplated hereby, then the Company Board shall take all
action necessary to render such statute inapplicable to the foregoing.

SECTION 6.15 Certain Litigation.

The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any litigation commenced after the
date hereof against the Company or any of its officer or directors by any
Company stockholder (on such stockholder\'s own behalf or on behalf of the
Company) relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the
litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in
the defense or settlement of any such litigation brought by stockholders of
the Company.

SECTION 6.16 Advice of Changes.

The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any change or event having a
Company Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.16 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to Parent. Parent shall promptly notify the
Company of any change or event having a material adverse effect on Parent, or
which may otherwise preclude Parent from consummating the Merger; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.16 shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Company.

SECTION 6.17 Notice of Claims.

The Company shall, promptly but in any event within five business days, notify
Parent in writing if and when the Company becomes aware of any claim or
threatened claim (in writing) that the conduct of the business of the Company
or any Subsidiary infringes upon or misappropriates the Intellectual Property
Rights of any third party. ARTICLE VII

which amount shall be payable in immediately available funds to an account

expenses related to entering into this Agreement and attempting to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company

Expenses due to the Company pursuant to this Section 8.03 and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company makes a claim that results in a judgment

costs and expenses incurred in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 8.03 at the prime rate of
Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

d."Third Party Acquisition" means any of the transactions included in the
definition of "Competing Transactions"; however, for purposes of the
definitions of "Third Party Acquisition," each reference to "15%" in the
definition of "Competing Transaction" should be replaced with "50%."

8.01(a)(vi) or Section 8.01(a)(vii) or (B) by the Company pursuant to Section
8.01(a)(vi), the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to Parent\'s and
Merger Sub\'s Reimbursable Expenses up to a maximum amount of $1,500,000. If
the Company terminates this agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(viii),
Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the Company\'s Reimbursable
Expenses up to a maximum amount of $1,500,000. Any payments pursuant to this
Section 8.03(e) shall be made within one business day of termination.

SECTION 8.04 Amendment.

behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that, after the approval and adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may be made
which by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
without obtaining such approval; provided further, that Section 6.11(a), the
last sentence of Section 9.06 and this proviso may not be amended without the
written approval of Financing Sources representing the required lenders under
the Financing. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any agreement
of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein

the stockholders of the Company, no extension or waiver may be made which by
Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without
obtaining such approval. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby.

equity. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein

applicable law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any
litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with
