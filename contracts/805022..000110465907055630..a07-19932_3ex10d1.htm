Date is referred to herein as " _Remaining Indebtedness_ ". Indebtedness of
the Companies in respect of which either a Seller Consent or a Buyer Consent

#### (ii) Not more than ten (10) Business Days nor less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
a certificate of an authorized officer setting forth: (A) Sellers good faith
estimate, as of the Closing Date, of (1) Net Working Capital (" _Estimated

to be outstanding as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Indebtedness_ ").
Seller shall also deliver to Buyer, simultaneously with such certificate,
payoff letters executed by each of the lenders or other financing sources

satisfactory to Buyer (the " _Payoff Letters_ "). Each Payoff Letter
shall contain the payoff amount, including principal, accrued but unpaid
interest, fees, prepayment costs or penalties, make-whole premiums or similar
costs (including a per diem amount or calculation through the Closing Date)
of the Closing Indebtedness to which it relates and shall authorize Seller
and Buyer, following the payment in full of such Closing Indebtedness, to
file any financing statements or take any other actions necessary to
terminate any outstanding Liens relating to such Closing Indebtedness. The
aggregate amount necessary to repay all the Indebtedness of the Companies as
of the Closing Date as set forth in the Payoff Letters is referred to herein
as the " _Company Indebtedness Payoff Amount_ ".

  

#### (iii) The Closing Date Purchase Price shall equal the Initial Purchase
Price, increased or decreased, as appropriate, by the amount of the Estimated
Net Working Capital Adjustment, and increased by the amount of Estimated
Expansion Expenditures and the amount of Estimated Cash.

  

#### (iv) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid on behalf of
the Companies, to the Persons named in the Payoff Letters associated with the
Paid Indebtedness, an aggregate dollar amount based on the payoff amounts set
forth in such Payoff Letters, such payment to be made by Buyer by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
each such Person, or as otherwise instructed by each Person, in the
Payoff Letters. At the Closing, Buyer may, but shall not be obligated to,
pay, or cause to be paid, to the Persons named in the Payoff Letters
associated with the Remaining Indebtedness, an aggregate dollar amount based
on the Payoff Letters in order to extinguish the Remaining Indebtedness.

  

### (b) _Adjustment Methodology_. The purchase price adjustments
hereunder shall be calculated as of the Closing Date, without giving effect
to any of the transactions hereunder, in accordance with GAAP or as otherwise
specified herein.

        

### (c) _Final Purchase Price Adjustment and Procedures_.

  

#### (i) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Adjustment Statement_ ") which shall
set forth Sellers calculation, as of the Closing Date, of (A) Net Working
Capital (" _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (B) amounts actually expended by
the Companies in connection with the Expansion during the period from January
1, 2007 until the Closing in accordance with _Section 6.1_  hereof, but only
to the extent such amounts are not included in Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (" _Closing Expansion Expenditures_ "), and (C) the cash and
cash equivalents of the Companies (" _Closing Cash_ "). Buyer shall provide
Seller and its independent accountant and financial advisor, at no expense to
Seller, with all reasonable accounting services, assistance and access during
normal business hours to the working papers, accounting and other books and
records of the Business and the appropriate personnel of the Business to the
extent required to complete its preparation of the Adjustment Statement.

  

#### (ii) After receipt of the Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall have twenty
(20) days to review the factual basis, mathematical calculations and
accounting methods used therein. On or prior to the 20th day after receipt of
the Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall deliver written notice to Seller
specifying in detail any disputed items and the basis therefor. Any such
notice shall include only objections based on (A) errors of fact underlying
the determination of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Expansion
Expenditures and Closing Cash, (B) mathematical errors in the computation of
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Expansion Expenditures and Closing Cash,
and (C) Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Expansion Expenditures and
Closing Cash not having been determined in accordance with this Agreement. If
Buyer fails to so notify Seller of any such disputes on or prior to the 20th
day after receipt of the Adjustment Statement, all calculations and
valuations of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Expansion Expenditures and
Closing Cash set forth on the Adjustment Statement shall be deemed accepted
by Buyer and shall be final, binding, conclusive and nonappealable for all
purposes of this Agreement.

  

#### (iii) If Buyer so notifies Seller of any disputed items on
the Adjustment Statement in accordance with the above provisions, Seller and
Buyer shall, over the twenty (20) days following the date of such notice (the
" _Resolution Period_ "), attempt to resolve their differences and any
written resolution by them as to any disputed item shall be final, binding,
conclusive and nonappealable for all purposes of this Agreement. If at the
conclusion of the Resolution Period, Seller and Buyer have not reached an
agreement on the disputed items, then all items remaining in dispute shall be
submitted by Seller and Buyer to the Neutral Auditor. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor shall be
borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller.  Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the parties in connection
with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Neutral Auditor shall be
borne by the party incurring such cost and expense. The Neutral
Auditor shall act as an arbitrator to determine only those items still in
dispute at the end of the Resolution Period. In no event shall the Neutral
Auditors determination be outside of the range of amounts claimed by the
respective parties with respect to those items in dispute. The parties shall
instruct the Neutral Auditor to render its reasoned written decision as soon
as practicable but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after its
engagement (which engagement shall be made no later than ten (10) Business
Days after the end of the Resolution

        

#### Period).  Such decision shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to Seller and Buyer and shall be final, binding, conclusive and
nonappealable for all purposes hereunder. The term " _Final Adjustment
Statement_ " shall mean the definitive Adjustment Statement agreed to (or
deemed agreed to) by Seller and Buyer in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)(ii_
) or this _Section 2.2(c)(iii)_ , or the definitive Adjustment Statement
resulting from the determination made by the Neutral Auditor in accordance
with this _Section 2.2(c)(iii)_ , in each case setting forth the final
determination of Closing Net Working Capital (" _Final Net Working Capital_
"), Closing Expansion Expenditures (" _Final Expansion Expenditures_ ") and
Closing Cash (" _Final Cash_ ").

  

#### (iv) If the Final Net Working Capital is greater than Estimated Net
Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such
excess, and if the Final Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net
Working Capital, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such
deficiency. If the Final Expansion Expenditures are greater than the
Estimated Expansion Expenditures, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal
to such excess, and if the Final Expansion Expenditures are less than the
Estimated Expansion Expenditures, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal
to such deficiency. If the Final Cash is greater than the Estimated Cash,
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such excess, and if the Final
Cash is less than the Estimated Cash, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to such deficiency. Amounts owing by the parties pursuant to
the foregoing shall be aggregated or netted, as applicable, so that only one
such payment shall be made. Any payments required pursuant to this _Section
2.2(c)(iv)_ (the " _Adjustment Amount_ ") shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by Seller or Buyer, as
the case may be, in United States Dollars, within five (5) Business Days
after (a) the Adjustment Statement has been accepted or deemed accepted by
Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)(ii)_ , (b) any proposed change made by
Buyer has been agreed upon by the parties during the Resolution Period or (c)
a final determination has been made by the Neutral Auditor as described in
_Section 2.2(c)(iii)_ , as applicable. Payments due shall be paid to the
applicable party together with interest at the Interest Rate from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment.

  

Section 2.3 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
abandoned pursuant to _Article VIII_ hereof, the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Andrews Kurth LLP in Houston, Texas, at 8:00 a.m.,

the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ hereof are satisfied or waived, or

conduct its business as it is now being conducted, and to own, lease and
operate its assets and properties. Seller is duly authorized, qualified

and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all requisite limited liability company action by Seller, and
Seller has full limited liability company power and authority to execute and

### to its terms, except where such failure would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Companies taken as a whole;
(ii) the Companies are not in default or breach under any Real Property
Agreement and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no other party thereto is in
default or breach under any Real Property Agreement, except in each case for
such defaults or breaches that would not, individually or in the aggregate,

Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred which with or without the giving
of notice or lapse of time, or both, may conflict in any respect with

cancel, terminate or modify, any Real Property Agreement, except in each case
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Companies taken as a whole; and (v) except as set forth in
_Schedule 3.3_  hereto, no Real Property Agreement requires any material

Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

regarding termination of any Real Property Agreement affecting a property at
which the Companies conduct Business operations prior to the scheduled
expiration of such Real Property Agreement.

Permitted Liens, to all material personal property that such Company purports
to own, including all personal property reflected as owned on the Most Recent
Balance Sheet (other than personal property sold, disposed of or replaced in
the ordinary course of business since the date thereof). To the Knowledge of
Seller, each Company has a valid leasehold interest in all personal property
that such Company purports to lease, and all such leases are in full force
and effect and constitute valid and binding obligations of and are
enforceable against, the lessors thereto, except where any such failure to be
in full force and effect, to constitute a valid and binding obligation, or to
be enforceable against the lessor thereto would not be material to the
Companies taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of the Seller, neither Company
is in breach of any of the terms of any such lease except where any such
breach would not be material to the Companies taken as a whole.

  

### (e) This _Section 4.5_ contains the sole and exclusive representations

Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

records of the Business; _provided_ that Buyer shall not be entitled to
perform any seismic tests or drilling or other "invasive" tests
(environmental or otherwise) without the prior written consent of
Seller (which may be withheld in its sole discretion).  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.2_ or in any other
provision of this Agreement, Seller shall not be required to permit any
inspection, to disclose any information, or to consent to any communication
with any Person if, in the reasonable judgment of Seller, such action would
(i) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties to whom
Seller or its Affiliates owe an obligation of confidentiality ( _provided_
that Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such
third parties to such disclosure) or proprietary predictive models of Seller,
(ii) violate any obligation of Seller, the Companies or Lodi Management with
respect to confidentiality ( _provided_ that Seller shall use its reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of any third party to such inspection,
disclosure or communication), or (iii) result in (as determined by Sellers
legal counsel) the loss of a legal privilege or a violation of the Hart-Scott
Act or of any other applicable laws, rules or regulations. In addition,
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to permit Buyer or any of its
representatives to have access to any files, records, contracts or documents
of Seller or Lodi Management relating to this transaction, including any bids
or offers received thereby for the sale of the LLC Interests, it being agreed
that all such bids or offers shall be the sole property of Seller.  Buyer
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, release and defend Seller, its members
and their Affiliates from and against any and all losses arising, in whole or
in part, from the acts or omissions of Buyer or any of its employees, agents
or representatives in connection with Buyers or its representatives
inspection of the properties, books and records of the Business, including
claims for personal injuries, property damage and reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses, which indemnification obligation shall survive the Closing and
the termination of this Agreement. Buyer and its representatives will hold
in confidence all information obtained from Seller, the Companies or
Lodi Management, or their respective officers, agents, representatives or
employees in accordance with the provisions of the confidentiality agreement
dated April 11, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") by and between
ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC and Buckeye Partners, L.P., the terms and
provisions of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

Section 6.3 _Efforts; Cooperation; No Inconsistent Action_.

  

### (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties will use their reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to

        

### ensure satisfaction of the conditions precedent to each partys
obligations hereunder. Buyer and Seller shall timely and promptly make all
filings which may be required by any of them in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby under the Hart-Scott
Act and the California Act. Each party shall furnish to the other party such
necessary information and assistance as such other party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of any necessary filings or
submissions by it to any Governmental Entity, including any filings necessary
under the provisions of the Hart-Scott Act and the California Act. Each party
shall provide the other party the opportunity to make copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between such party and its representatives, and the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, the CPUC or any other Governmental Entity and members
of their respective staffs with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. With the exception of payment of the
required filing fees and the parties costs and expenses necessary to
prosecute such filings, neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to make
any material monetary expenditures, commence or participate in any material
litigation, or offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third Person or Governmental Entity in connection
therewith.

  

### (b) From time to time after the Closing Date, without further
consideration, Seller will, at its own expense, execute and deliver such
documents to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably request in order to more
effectively consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. From
time to time after the Closing Date, without further consideration, Buyer
will, at its own expense, execute and deliver such documents as Seller may
reasonably request in order to more effectively consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### (c) Seller and Buyer shall notify and keep the other advised as to any
litigation or administrative proceeding pending and known to such party, or
to its Knowledge, threatened, which challenges the transactions contemplated
hereby. Seller and Buyer shall act in good faith and shall not take any
action inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement or which would
materially hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or the prompt receipt of required consents or approvals
under the Hart-Scott Act, the California Act or other applicable Laws.

  

### (d) After the Closing Date, each party shall have reasonable access to
the employees of the other party and its Affiliates, for purposes of
consultation or otherwise, to the extent that such access may reasonably be
required in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operation
of the Business prior to the Closing Date. The parties agree to cooperate in
connection with any audit, investigation, hearing or inquiry by any
Governmental Entity, litigation or regulatory or other proceeding which may
arise following the Closing Date and which relates to the ownership of LLC
Interests or the operation of the Business, prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
party shall bear its own expenses, including fees of attorneys or other
representatives, in connection with any such matter described in this
_Section 6.3_ in which Seller and Buyer are subjects or parties or in which
they have a material interest.

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller
and its Affiliates shall be entitled to exclusively control, conduct and
direct the prosecution or defense of

        

### any of the matters set forth in _Schedule 4.8_ including the decision
whether to settle (and amount therefore) and whether to proceed to trial or
arbitration and Buyer agrees to waive any conflicts necessary to allow
current counsel to continue to represent Seller with respect to such matters.
After the Closing, Buyer shall reasonably cooperate and shall cause the
Companies to cooperate in all respects with Seller and its Affiliates in the
prosecution or defense of all of the foregoing matters, including providing
access to witnesses for interviews, depositions or trial, documents and
electronic information actually or constructively under the control of Buyer
or the Companies, providing a corporate representative at trial or
arbitration, and executing affidavits and settlement agreements. Seller
shall reimburse Buyer for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses in providing such cooperation; _provided_ that Seller shall not be
required to reimburse Buyer for the costs and expenses of separate legal
counsel in connection with Buyers providing such cooperation. In addition,
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller retains the rights to any
recovery resulting from the matters listed in _Schedule 4.8_ and other
matters involving the Companies that Seller remains responsible for pursuant
to the provisions of _Article IX_ or _Article X_ of this Agreement.

  

### (f) In no event shall Buyer or Seller (and Seller shall cause the
Companies not to) at any time take (or permit any Affiliate of Buyer or
Seller to take) any action that would reasonably be expected to hinder or
delay the grant by the CPUC of authority for the construction and operation
of the Kirby Hills Phase II natural gas storage facility as requested in
A.07-05-009, filed with the CPUC on May 8, 2007. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller and the Companies shall be permitted to take such
commercially reasonable actions as any of them deems appropriate in order to
continue to operate the Business as presently conducted.  Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed as a covenant or obligation in favor of Buyer,
or as a condition precedent to Buyers obligation to consummate the
transaction at Closing, that Seller or the Companies must agree to any terms
or conditions of, or proposed by, the CPUC in connection with the grant of
authority for the construction and operation of the Kirby Hills Phase II
natural gas storage facility to the extent such terms or conditions are
not acceptable to Seller and the Companies in their sole discretion.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in connection with the grant of
authority for the construction and operation of the Kirby Hills Phase II
natural gas storage facility as contemplated in the filing on May 8, 2007 as
referred to above, Buyer shall not be obligated to consummate the Closing if,
prior to Closing, the CPUC establishes in a final, nonappealable order any
terms or conditions that are materially different from the terms and
conditions set forth in such filing, and such terms or conditions would
require Buyer or the Companies to make any material monetary expenditures,
commence or participate in any material litigation, or offer or grant any
material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third Person
or Governmental Entity. If, following the Closing and in granting the
authority for the construction and operation of the Kirby Hills Phase II
natural gas storage facility as contemplated in the filing on May 8, 2007 as
referred to above, the CPUC establishes in a final, nonappealable order any
terms or conditions that are materially different from the terms and
conditions set forth in the May 8, 2007 CPUC filing, and such terms or
conditions would require Buyer or the Companies to make any material monetary
expenditures, commence or participate in any material litigation, or offer or
grant any material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third Person
or Governmental Entity, Buyer shall not be obligated to pay the Contingent
Purchase Price as set forth in _Section 2.1(c)_ hereof. In the event that
Buyer contends it is not required to pay the Contingent Purchase Price
pursuant to, and in accordance with, this _Section 6.3(f)_ , then Buyer
shall, within five (5) Business Days after the date on which the CPUC issues

        

### the order granting such authority, provide written notice to Seller of
Buyers election and the specific reasons (including specific references to
the order) why Buyer believes that it is not required to pay the Contingent
Purchase Price.

  

### (g) In the event that, as of Closing, the Companies shall not have
received an order from the CPUC granting authority for the construction and
operation of the Kirby Hills Phase II natural gas storage facility, then
Buyer shall, and shall also cause the Companies to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to secure such order from the CPUC as contemplated by
_Section 2.1(c)_.

  

Section 6.4 _Public Disclosures_. Prior to the Closing Date, no party
to this Agreement or its representatives or Affiliates will issue any press
release or make any public disclosure concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
party. After the Closing Date, no party will issue any press release or make
any public disclosure concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the contents of this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this Section will preclude
any party from making any disclosures that are required by Law or the rules
or regulations of any agency with jurisdiction over such party (or the
securities of any of its Affiliates) or are necessary and proper in
conjunction with the filing of any Tax Return or other document required
to be filed with any Governmental Entity; _provided_  that the party
required to make such disclosure shall allow the other party reasonable time
to review and comment thereon in advance of such disclosure.

  

Section 6.5 _Access to Records and Personnel_.

  

### (a) Buyer shall retain (or use reasonable efforts to cause the Companies
after Closing to retain) the books, records, documents, instruments,
accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences of title and other papers (in
each case, including electronic versions thereof) relating to the Business or
the Companies and the period before Closing (the " _Books and Records_ ") for
the period of time set forth in its records retention policies on the Closing
Date or for such longer period as may be required by Law or any applicable
court order but in any event for at least seven (7) years. After the seven-
year period, before Buyer or the Companies shall dispose of any such Books
and Records, Buyer shall give at least forty-five (45) days prior written
notice to such effect to Seller, and Seller shall be given the opportunity,
at its expense, to remove and retain all or any part of such Books and
Records as Seller may elect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
retain (or cause the Companies to retain) for such longer periods any and all
material Books and Records that relate to any ongoing litigation,
investigation, Action or proceeding until such time as Buyer is notified of
the final conclusion of such matter.

  

### (b) The parties will allow each other reasonable access to such Books and
Records, and to personnel having knowledge of the whereabouts and/or contents
of such Books and Records, for legitimate business reasons, such as the
preparation of Tax Returns or the defense of litigation and responding to
data requests from Governmental Entities. Each party shall be entitled to
recover its out-of-pocket costs (including copying costs) incurred
in providing such records and/or personnel to the other party. The requesting
party will hold in confidence

        

### (except as required by applicable Law, and then only after giving the
disclosing party an opportunity to seek an appropriate remedy) all
confidential information identified as such by, and obtained from, the
disclosing party, any of its officers, agents, representatives or employees,
_provided, however,_ that information which (i) was in the public domain;
(ii) was in fact known to the requesting party prior to disclosure by the
disclosing party, its officers, agents, representatives or employees; or
(iii) becomes known to the requesting party from or through a third party not
under an obligation of non-disclosure to the disclosing party, shall not be
deemed to be confidential information.

  

Section 6.6 _Employee Matters_.

  

### (a) _Pre-Closing and Post-Closing Compensation and Benefits_.  The
parties acknowledge that prior to the date of this Agreement, Lodi Management
has furnished certain administrative, management, accounting and operational
services to Lodi Gas pursuant to the Management and Support Services
Agreement effective as of December 15, 2005, by and between Lodi Management
and Lodi Gas (the " _Services Agreement_ "). Seller shall use its reasonable
efforts to cause Lodi Management and Lodi Gas to perform their respective
obligations pursuant to the Services Agreement during the period following
the execution of this Agreement until the Closing Date, at which time the
Services Agreement shall be terminated. As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall,
or shall cause Lodi Gas or one of Buyers Affiliates to, either (i) offer to
employ each of the Lodi Management employees listed in _Schedule 6.6_ (which
_Schedule_ _6.6_ may be updated to reflect changes therein since the date of
this Agreement through the Closing Date that have been made in the ordinary
course of business; such listed employees being together, the " _Employees_
"), in each case with compensation not less than such Employees annual base
salary for 2007 as of the date of this Agreement and with a reasonable
opportunity to receive a comparable bonus for their targeted 2007 bonus
amount as of the date of this Agreement (except, in each case, for any
Employee who has started employment after the date of this Agreement, and
then such amounts shall be as of the date of such employment) and otherwise
on terms and conditions consistent with the provisions of this _Section 6.6_
, or (ii) provide a severance benefit equal to such Employees annual base
salary. Each Employee actually employed by Buyer, or one of Buyers
Affiliates or Lodi Gas shall be employed for not less than the one (1) year
period following the Closing Date ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may
terminate the employment of any Employee for cause during such period) and
shall receive employee benefits (including health insurance) that are
substantially similar to those provided to the Employees as set forth in
_Schedule 6.6_. Following the execution of this Agreement, Buyer may conduct
discussions and negotiations with the Employees with regard to the terms of
their possible employment by Buyer, Lodi Gas or one of Buyers Affiliates and
shall notify each Employee of Buyers election pursuant to this _Section
6.6(a)_ within forty-five (45) days after such date of execution of this
Agreement, _provided_  that in no event shall Buyer or its Affiliates seek to
influence, interfere with, or otherwise affect such employees conduct or
discharge of their responsibilities and duties as employees of Lodi
Management during their continued employment by Lodi Management through the
Closing.

  

### (b) _Service Credit for Employees_. In connection with the employment of
Employees pursuant to _Section 6.6(a)_ , Buyer shall cause Lodi Gas or one of
Buyers Affiliates that employs such Employees after the Closing (as the case
may be) to provide each Employee with full service credit for all purposes,
including eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals, under

        

### all incentive, compensation and employee benefit plans, policies,
agreements and arrangements maintained by Lodi Gas or such Buyer Affiliate in
which such Employee participates on or after the Closing Date to the same
extent such Employees service was recognized under the corresponding plans,
policies, agreements and arrangements in which such Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Employees shall not be eligible to participate in employee benefit plans,
policies, agreements and arrangements maintained by Buyer for which no new
employees of Buyer are eligible, such as Buyers Employee Stock Ownership
Plan, Retirement Income Guarantee Plan, and Retiree Medical Plan.

  

### (c) _Employee Health Plans_. In connection with the employment
of Employees pursuant to _Section 6.6(a)_ , Buyer shall, or shall use
its reasonable efforts to cause Lodi Gas or one of Buyers Affiliates (as the
case may be) to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
evidence of insurability, exclusions, waiting periods and actively-at-work
requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to each Employee under any employee health plans established by
Buyer, Lodi Gas or one of Buyers Affiliates pursuant to _Section 6.6(a)_ in
which such Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Closing
Date, and (ii) provide each Employee with credit for any co-payments,
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the Closing Date in
satisfying any applicable co-payment, deductible and out-of-pocket expense
requirements under such employee health plans in which such Employee may be
eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date. Buyer shall offer, or
shall cause Lodi Gas or Buyers Affiliate (as the case may be) to offer,
continuation health care coverage to Employees who accept employment with
Lodi Gas or Buyers Affiliate, as the case may be, after the Closing Date and
their qualified beneficiaries who incur or incurred a qualifying event,
in accordance with the continuation health care coverage requirements of
Section 4980B of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA (" _COBRA_
"), with respect to claims incurred on or after the Closing Date.

  

### (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement only and shall not be construed to grant any
rights, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, to any person who is not a
party to this Agreement, nor shall any provision of this Agreement be deemed
to be the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan
sponsored or maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or otherwise to
limit the right of Buyer and its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
of their employee benefit plans.

  

Section 6.7 _Workforce Reduction Notices_. Any workforce reductions
carried out on or after the Closing Date by Buyer, Lodi Gas or any of Buyers
Affiliates, as the case may be, shall be done in accordance with
all applicable laws and regulations governing the employment relationship
and termination thereof including, if applicable, the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act (" _WARN_ ") and regulations
promulgated thereunder, and any comparable state or local law. Buyer shall
not be responsible for any obligations under WARN or equivalent state
statutes and any applicable regulations thereunder with respect to any
employment terminations prior to the Closing Date.

  

Section 6.8 _Non-Solicitation_. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees that,
except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement, during the term of
one year after the date of this Agreement, it shall not directly or
indirectly (a) induce or attempt to induce any employee of the

        

other party or its Affiliates (including the Companies to the extent
applicable) to leave its employ, induce or attempt to induce any consultant
or independent contractor to discontinue work with such other party or in any
way interfere with the relationship between such other party and any
employee, consultant or independent contractor, or (b) hire any person who
was an employee, consultant or independent contractor of such other party.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth herein shall not
prohibit the employment of, or other retention of the services of, any
such employee, consultant or independent contractor if such person initiates
contact without the hiring partys encouragement, or prohibit the use of any
general newspaper solicitations not directed at such other partys
employees, consultants or independent contractors.

  

Section 6.9 _Amendments of Disclosure Schedules_. Seller may, from
time to time, prior to the Closing, by written notice to Buyer, supplement or
amend its disclosure schedules to _Articles III_ and _IV_  attached to this
Agreement (" _Disclosure Schedules_ ") to correct any matter that would
constitute a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller herein
contained if such supplement or amendment relates to a matter that did not
arise until after the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that, if Seller
amends any Disclosure Schedule within ten (10) Business Days of the
anticipated Closing Date, Buyer shall have the right to postpone the Closing
Date until the date which is ten (10) Business Days after Seller revises any
such Disclosure Schedule and provides Buyer with a copy thereof. Any
amendments or supplements shall not be effective for determining whether
Buyers conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ have been
satisfied. If immediately prior to the Closing, Buyers condition to Closing
set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ is satisfied, then any such Disclosure Schedule
amendments or supplements shall not be effective to cure or correct any
breach of any representation or warranty that would have existed absent such
amendment or supplement for the purposes of Sellers indemnification
obligations under _Section 9.2(a)_. If immediately prior to the Closing,
Buyers condition to Closing set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ is not satisfied,
and the Closing occurs nonetheless, any such Disclosure Schedule amendments
or supplements will be effective to cure and correct any breach of any
representation or warranty that would have existed absent such amendment
or supplement, and Buyer shall have no right, and hereby waives any and
all rights, to bring any claim in respect thereof or relating thereto.

  

Section 6.10 _Intercompany Liabilities; Indebtedness; Release of
Liens_.

  

### (a) Prior to or on the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Companies to, settle, repay or cancel all intercompany accounts that are
unpaid as of the Closing Date between the Companies, on the one hand, and
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies), on the other hand.

  

### (b) Prior to or on the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Companies to
extinguish all guarantees by the Companies of any Indebtedness or other
obligation of any third party, including Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Companies).

  

### (c) Prior to or on the Closing Date, Seller shall have caused to be
released all Liens, except as listed in _Schedule 3.4_ , in and upon any of
the property and assets of the Companies, other than Permitted Liens.  Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that it will be

        

### consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
Development Agreement surviving Closing.

  

### (d) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Seller and its Affiliates
will be terminating as of the Closing the Place in Funds Letter referenced in
_Schedule 4.15_ and that it is Buyers obligation and responsibility to
replace or otherwise deal with the obligations and commitments referenced in
such Place in Funds Letter.

be delivered to Buyer duly signed resignations, effective immediately
after Closing, of the directors, officers and managers of Lodi Gas and
Lodi Development.

  

Section 6.12 _Compliance with Development Agreement_. Seller shall
comply with its obligations, if any, under _Article III_ of that certain
Development Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2000 (the "
_Development Agreement_ "), among Lodi Gas, Western Hub and Calpine Energy
Services, L.P. (" _CES_ "), as successor by merger to CPN Gas Marketing
Company (" _CPN_ "), as amended. Buyer agrees that Sellers compliance with
the obligations and requirements set forth in the Development Agreement shall
not be deemed a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Seller
shall promptly give Buyer written notice of the exercise by any party to the
Development Agreement of the "right of first offer" set forth therein.

  

Section 6.13 _Exclusivity_. Except with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller agrees that it will not, and it
will cause the Companies and their respective managers, directors,
officers, employees, consultants, Affiliates and other agents and
representatives (including any investment banking, legal or accounting firm
retained by Seller or either Company or any of their Agents and any
individual member or employee of the foregoing) (each, an " _Agent_ ") not
to: (a) initiate, solicit or seek, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or
the making or implementation of any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, acquisition, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, equity investment or similar transaction involving, or any
purchase of all or any substantial portion of the assets or any equity
securities of, Seller or either Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as a "
_Proposal_ "); (b) engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
confidential information or data to, or have any substantive discussions
with, any person relating to a Proposal; (c) otherwise cooperate in any
effort or attempt to make, implement or accept a Proposal; or (d) enter into
a contract, arrangement or agreement with any Person relating to a Proposal.
Seller shall notify Buyer promptly if any substantive inquiries, proposals or
offers related to a Proposal are received by, any confidential information or
data is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions related to a
Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, Seller, either
Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Agents.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller, the Companies and each of
their Agents may take such actions as any of them reasonably deem appropriate
in connection with the rights of CES under the Development Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

Section 6.14 _D andO Insurance and Indemnities_. Buyer shall purchase a
six-year extended reporting period endorsement ("reporting tail coverage")
under the Companies existing directors and officers liability insurance
coverage, _provided_  that such reporting tail

        

coverage shall extend the director and officer liability coverage in force as
of the date of this Agreement from the Closing Date on terms, that in all
material respects, are no less favorable to the intended beneficiaries
thereof than the existing directors and officers liability insurance.
 Buyer shall maintain for a six-year period all director and
officer indemnities in the organizational documents of the Companies, and
shall extend such indemnities to the individuals serving as directors or
officers of either of the Companies immediately prior to the Closing, even
though the individuals serving in such capacities may no longer be directors
or officers after the Closing.

Closing regarding the existence of a breach of any of
Sellers representations and warranties in _Articles III_ or _IV_ for
the purposes of _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ or the amount of any Damages with
respect thereto, all such representations and warranties that are qualified

_Section 4.4_ ; (B) the first sentence of _Section 4.5(b)_ ; (C) the first

_Section 9.2_ as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price unless otherwise

to the extent provided under _Section 9.2(a)_ for all reasonable costs and
expenses of defending such claim incurred by Buyer, including reasonable fees

party shall, without the prior written consent of the other party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned, settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand on a
basis which would result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or
decree which would restrict the future activity or conduct of the other
parties or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof or if such settlement or
compromise does not include an unconditional release of the other parties for
any liability arising out of such claim or demand or any related claim or
demand. The foregoing provision shall not apply to Sellers control of the
matters set forth in _Schedule 4.8_  which shall be governed by _Section
6.3(e)_.

  

### (f) Seller shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such third-
party claim, but shall be able to participate fully and jointly with Buyer,
if:

  

#### (i) the third-party claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary
damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief (except where non-monetary
relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims for monetary
damages);

  

#### (ii) the third-party claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; or

  

#### (iii) the third-party claim would give rise to Damages that are more
than the amount indemnifiable by Seller pursuant to this _Article IX_.

  

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

  

### (a) Except as otherwise provided in _Article X_ below and subject to the
further provisions hereof, Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold Seller, its
Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and their
respective shareholders, members, partners (general and limited), officers,
directors, managers, employees, agents, and representatives, and each of
their heirs, executors, successors and assigns (" _Seller Indemnified
Parties_ "), harmless from and against and in respect of any and all Damages
arising out of (i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties of
Buyer in this Agreement, and (ii) any breach of any of the covenants or other
agreements of Buyer in this Agreement. For all determinations made after the
Closing regarding the existence of a breach of any of Buyers representations
and warranties in _Article V_ for the purposes of _Section 9.3(a)(i)_ or the
amount of any Damages with respect thereto, all such representations
and warranties that are qualified by materiality or by reference to Material
Adverse Effect shall be deemed to be not so qualified.

  

### (b) Buyers indemnification obligations under  _Section 9.3(a)_ shall
terminate upon expiration of the applicable Survival Period.

        

### (c) The indemnities provided in this _Section 9.3_ shall survive the
Closing. The indemnity provided in this _Section 9.3_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Seller Indemnified Parties against Buyer at law or in
equity relating to this Agreement in the transactions contemplated hereby.
The parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)_ as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price unless otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code.

  

### (d) Seller shall give Buyer prompt written notice of any third party
claim which may give rise to any indemnity obligation under this Section,
together with the estimated amount of such claim, and Buyer shall have the
right to assume the defense of any such claim through counsel of its own
choosing, by so notifying Seller within sixty (60) days of receipt
of Sellers written notice. Failure to give prompt notice shall not affect
the indemnification obligations hereunder in the absence of actual prejudice.
If Seller desires to participate in, but not control, any such defense
assumed by Buyer it may do so at its sole cost and expense.  If Buyer fails
to assume any such defense, it shall be liable for all reasonable costs and
expenses of defending such claim incurred by Seller, including reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel in the event it is ultimately determined
that Buyer is liable for such claims pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
No party shall, without the prior written consent of the other party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand on a
basis which would result in the imposition of a consent order, injunction or
decree which would restrict the future activity or conduct of the other
parties or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof or if such settlement or
compromise does not include an unconditional release of the other parties for
any liability arising out of such claim or demand.

  

### (e) Buyer shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such third-party
claim, but shall be able to participate fully and jointly with Seller, if:

relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims for monetary
damages);

  

#### (ii) the third-party claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; or

than the amount indemnifiable by Buyer pursuant to this _Article IX_.

  

Section 9.4 _Other Indemnification Matters_.

this _Article IX_ shall be computed net of any insurance or other proceeds

claims under any applicable insurance policies and against other third
parties who may be responsible for Damages.

        

### (c) The parties agree that the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Agreement shall not apply to any Damages to the extent such Damages are
accounted for in the calculations of the purchase price adjustments set forth
in _Section 2.2_.

their respective Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price
Allocation and otherwise to be bound by such Purchase Price Allocation
(including the preparation of all books, records, and filings) unless
otherwise required by Law.  In consultation with Buyer, Seller shall prepare
an initial Purchase Price Allocation (based upon the Initial Purchase Price
and any adjustments known to Seller) and send it to Buyer no later than

Date.  Buyer shall review the proposed Purchase Price Allocation and

modifications within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such initial Purchase
Price Allocation. If Seller agrees with Buyers suggested modifications,

Allocation shall be adjusted only to the extent necessary to account for the
final adjustments to the Initial Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

(or any modification or amendment to the final or any interim Purchase
Price Allocation), Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve their
differences as soon as possible, but in all events prior to the Closing Date.
If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon the Purchase Price Allocation at
least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall

their respective expenses (such as legal, investment banker and accounting
fees) incurred in connection with the origination, negotiation, execution

responsible for payment of all Transfer Taxes, as provided under _Section

any party hereto without the express prior written consent of the other

consent, shall be null and void.  In no event shall any assignment or
transfer hereunder serve to release or discharge the assigning party from any
of its duties and obligations hereunder, unless expressly released, in
writing, by the non-assigning party.

party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein, and in any documents delivered or
to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement and in connection with the Closing
hereunder. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of
this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach.

  

Section 11.5 No  _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly
provided herein, including in _Section 6.14_ and _Article X_  hereof, this
Agreement is not intended, nor shall it be deemed, construed or interpreted,

hereunder.

  

Section 11.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the rights and
duties of the parties hereunder shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, other than matters

borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or if such court does not have
jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County,
for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the parties hereto
further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
U.S. registered mail to such partys respective address set forth in _Section
11.1_ shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding in New York with respect to any matters to which it has submitted
to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence.
Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising

United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or (b) the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and hereby further

any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

exhibits hereto, along with the Confidentiality Agreement, the letter
agreement dated July 24, 2007 between Buyer and Seller and the
letter agreement dated July 24, 2007 between BGH GP Holdings, LLC and Seller,
set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

  

Section 11.9 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement shall

or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement shall not be
affected and shall remain in full force and effect.

  

Section 11.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and
all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument.

Seller and Buyer shall execute and/or cause to be executed and delivered such
other documents and instruments and shall do such other acts that may be
reasonably necessary or desirable, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to carry out the intent of this
Agreement.

  

Section 11.12 _Schedules, Annexes_ and Exhibits. All schedules, annexes
and exhibits hereto are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of
this Agreement.

  

Section 11.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER
NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS
PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND
BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY
AND THAT ANY

        

ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF
COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

  

Section 11.14 _Time_. Time is of the essence in the performance
of this Agreement in all respects.

  

Section 11.15 _Disclosure_. Any fact or item that is disclosed on
any schedule, annex or exhibit to this Agreement or in the Financial
Statements so as to make its relevance to other representations made
elsewhere in this Agreement or to the information called for by other
schedules, annexes or exhibits to this Agreement reasonably apparent shall be
deemed to qualify such representations or to be disclosed on such other
schedules, annexes or exhibits, as the case may be, notwithstanding the
omission of a reference or cross-reference thereto. Any fact or item
disclosed on any schedule, annex or exhibit hereto shall not by reason only
of such inclusion be deemed to be material and shall not be employed as
a point of reference in determining any standard of materiality under
this Agreement. In addition, matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedules
are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be
reflected in such Disclosure Schedules, and any such additional matters are
set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include
other matters of a similar nature. The disclosure of any information shall
not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such information is
required to be disclosed in connection with the representations and
warranties made.

  

Section 11.16 _Limitation on Damages_. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall
have any liability for, and each party hereby waives any right to
recover from the other party or any of its owners, officers or Affiliates,
punitive, incidental, special, exemplary and consequential damages arising in
connection with or with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section 11.16_ shall
not prevent any party from seeking indemnification hereunder for claims of
third parties for damages that are punitive, incidental, special, exemplary
or consequential in nature (for purposes of clarity, in no event shall Buyer
be able to seek indemnification for any such punitive, incidental, special,
exemplary or consequential damages in respect of claims brought against
Buyer, Buckeye Partners, L.P. or any other Buyer Indemnified Parties by any
Buyer Indemnified Party).

  

Section 11.17 _Seller Guaranty_. ArcLight Energy Partners Fund I,
L.P. and ArcLight Energy Partners Fund II, L.P. hereby each guaranty, jointly
and severally, the full and prompt performance and payment when due of all
obligations of Seller under _Sections 9.2_ and _10.1_ (subject to all
limitations in such Sections); _provided however_ , that such guaranty
obligations shall terminate in full on the earlier of (i) the date that is
three years after the Closing Date and (ii) the date Buyer and its Affiliates
cease to control the Companies.

  

Section 11.18 _Buyer Guaranty_. Buckeye Partners, L.P. hereby
guarantees the full and prompt performance and payment when due of
all obligations of Buyer at or prior to the Closing.
