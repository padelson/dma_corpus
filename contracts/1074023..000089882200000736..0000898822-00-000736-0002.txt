AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 3, 2000 (this "Agreement"),
by and between FIRSTAR CORPORATION, a Wisconsin corporation ("Firstar"), and
U.S. BANCORP, a Delaware corporation ("U.S. Bancorp").   W I T N E S S E T H
:  - - - - - - - - - -    WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of
Firstar and U.S. Bancorp have determined that it is in the best interests of
their respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic
business combination transaction provided for herein in which Firstar will,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into
U.S. Bancorp (the "Merger"), so that U.S. Bancorp is the surviving
corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the
"Surviving Corporation") in the Merger; and   WHEREAS, as a condition to,
and immediately after, the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition to
the execution of the Firstar Option Agreement, U.S. Bancorp and Firstar are
entering into a stock option agreement with U.S. Bancorp as issuer, and
Firstar as grantee, of the stock option contemplated thereby (the "U.S.
Bancorp Option Agreement") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A; and  
WHEREAS, as a condition to, and immediately after, the execution of
this Agreement, and as a condition to the execution of the U.S. Bancorp
Option Agreement, U.S. Bancorp and Firstar are entering into a stock option
agreement with Firstar as issuer, and U.S. Bancorp as grantee, of the stock
option contemplated thereby (the "Firstar Option Agreement"; and together
with the U.S. Bancorp Option Agreement, the "Option Agreements") in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B; and   WHEREAS, it is the intention of the
parties that the Merger be accounted for as a "pooling of interests" under
generally accepted accounting principles and constitute a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code; and   WHEREAS, the parties desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE
MERGER   1.1 THE MERGER. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, in accordance with the Business Corporation Law of the State
of Wisconsin (the "WBCL") and the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Firstar shall    merge
with and into U.S. Bancorp. U.S. Bancorp shall be the Surviving Corporation
in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of
the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Firstar shall terminate.   (b) Firstar and
U.S. Bancorp may, upon mutual agreement, at any time change the method of
effecting the combination of U.S. Bancorp and Firstar (including without
limitation the provisions of this Article I) if and to the extent they deem
such change to be desirable, including without limitation, to provide for a
merger of either party with a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the other; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount of
consideration to be provided to holders of either Firstar Common Stock or
U.S. Bancorp Common Stock as provided for in this Agreement (the
"Merger Consideration"), (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of
shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration or (iii)
materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger shall become effective as
set forth in articles of merger (the "Wisconsin Articles") that shall be
filed with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (the "Wisconsin
Department"), and in the certificate of merger (the "Delaware Certificate")
that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the
"Delaware Secretary"), in each case on the Closing Date. The term "Effective
Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set
forth in the Wisconsin Articles and the Delaware Certificate.   1.3 EFFECTS
OF THE MERGER. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the WBCL and the DGCL.   1.4 CONVERSION OF STOCK. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of U.S. Bancorp, Firstar or the holder of any of the following
securities:   (a) Subject to Sections 2.2(d) and 2.2(f), (i) each share of
the common stock, par value $1.25 per share, of U.S. Bancorp (the "U.S.
Bancorp Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into 1.265 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of
the common stock, par value $1.25 per share, of the Surviving Corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation Common Stock"); and (ii) each share of Term
Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of U.S. Bancorp
(the "Term Preferred Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall remain outstanding, but the "Reference Package"
referred to in the terms thereof shall be adjusted to comprise 12.65 shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock or such other number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock as may be required from time to time
pursuant to Section 4 of the Certificate of Designation and Terms of the Term
Preferred Stock as in effect as of the date hereof.   (b) Except as
otherwise provided in Section 1.4(e), at and after the Effective Time, each
share of Firstar common stock, par value $0.01 per share (together with the
Firstar Shareholder Rights attached thereto, the "Firstar Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for
shares of Firstar Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by U.S. Bancorp
or Firstar or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries (other than
(i) shares of Firstar Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, in
trust accounts, managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary capacity, that are beneficially owned by   -2-    third
parties (any such shares, whether held directly or indirectly by U.S. Bancorp
or Firstar, as the case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust Account
Shares") and (ii) any shares of Firstar Common Stock held by U.S. Bancorp or
Firstar or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a
debt previously contracted (any such shares of Firstar Common Stock, and
shares of U.S. Bancorp Common Stock that are similarly held, whether held
directly or indirectly, by U.S. Bancorp or Firstar, being referred to herein
as "DPC Shares"), shall be converted into one share of the Surviving
Corporation Common Stock. As used herein, "Firstar Shareholder Rights" shall
mean the preferred share purchase rights issued to the holders of Firstar
Common Stock pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of November 20, 1998
(as such may be amended, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to
time), between Firstar and Firstar Bank, N.A. (the "Firstar Rights
Agreement").   (c) Holders of certificates formerly representing Firstar
Common Stock shall not be required to exchange such certificates for
certificates representing Surviving Corporation Common Stock, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if an exchange of such certificates is required by law or
applicable rule or regulation, the parties will cause the Surviving
Corporation to arrange for such exchange on a one-share-for-one-share basis.
Holders of certificates representing U.S. Bancorp Common Stock referred to in
Article II ("Old Certificates") shall exchange such Old Certificates for
certificates representing shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock ("New
Certificates") in the manner described in Section 2.2.   (d) If, prior to
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Firstar Common Stock or U.S.
Bancorp Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result
of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend,
stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization,
an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange
Ratio.   (e) At the Effective Time, all shares of Firstar Common Stock that
are owned, directly or indirectly, by U.S. Bancorp or Firstar or any of
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares
and DPC Shares) shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of U.S.
Bancorp Common Stock that are owned by Firstar or any of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall as of the
Effective Time become authorized but unissued shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock.   1.5 OPTIONS. (a) At the Effective Time, without any action
on the part of any holder of any such option, each option to purchase shares
of U.S. Bancorp Common Stock (each, a "U.S. Bancorp Option") that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall cease to
represent a right to acquire shares of U.S. Bancorp Common Stock and shall be
converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined as
provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the U.S. Bancorp Stock
Plans (as defined in Section 4.2) and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder):   (i) The number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock to  be subject to the new option shall be equal to the product of (A)
the  number of shares of U.S. Bancorp Common Stock purchasable upon exercise
of  the original U.S. Bancorp   -3-     Option and (B) the Exchange
Ratio, the product being rounded, if  necessary, up or down, to the nearest
whole share; and   (ii) The exercise price per share of Surviving
Corporation Common  Stock under the new option shall be equal to the exercise
price per share  of U.S. Bancorp Common Stock under the original U.S. Bancorp
Option  divided by the Exchange Ratio, PROVIDED that such exercise price
shall be  rounded to the nearest whole cent.   (b) The adjustment provided
in Section 1.5(a) with respect to any options that are "incentive stock
options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner
that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The duration and other
terms of the new option shall be the same as the original option.   1.6
FIRSTAR OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any holder of any such option, each option
to purchase shares of Firstar Common Stock (each, a "Firstar Option") that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation and shall cease to represent the right to acquire
shares of Firstar Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to
purchase shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, on the same terms and
conditions as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that all references to Firstar shall be deemed to be references to the
Surviving Corporation.   1.7 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be in the
form to be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof and in any event prior to the mailing
of the Joint Proxy Statement, PROVIDED that such Certificate of Incorporation
shall be substantially identical (providing for changes required to conform
to requirements of the DGCL and to accommodate the Term Preferred Stock) to
the Articles of Incorporation of Firstar (the "Firstar Articles"), with such
changes as the parties may mutually agree upon, PROVIDED FURTHER that the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall provide that
the name of the Surviving Corporation is "U.S. Bancorp" and the number of
authorized shares of common stock and preferred stock shall be 4,000,000,000,
par value $1.25 per share, and 50,000,000, par value $1.00 per share,
respectively.   1.8 BY-LAWS. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be in the form to be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof and in any event prior to
the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, PROVIDED that such By-Laws shall be
substantially identical (providing for changes required to conform to
requirements of the DGCL) to the By-Laws of Firstar, with such changes as the
parties may mutually agree upon.   1.9 TAX AND ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCES. It
is intended that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, that this Agreement shall constitute a
"plan of reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code
and that the Merger shall be accounted for as a "pooling of interests" under
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").   -4-     1.10 BOARD
OF DIRECTORS. At the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be comprised of 25 individuals, 11 named by U.S. Bancorp
and 14 named by Firstar. The directors of the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time shall each hold office in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.   1.11 HEADQUARTERS
OF SURVIVING CORPORATION. From and after the Effective Time, the location of
the headquarters and principal executive offices of the Surviving Corporation
shall be Minneapolis, Minnesota.   ARTICLE II   EXCHANGE OF SHARES   2.1
EXCHANGE OF OLD CERTIFICATES FOR NEW CERTIFICATES. (a) From the Effective
Time until the end of the 18-month period following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall make available to an exchange agent (which may be
a Subsidiary bank of the Surviving Corporation) appointed prior to
the Effective Time by U.S. Bancorp and Firstar jointly on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation (the "Exchange Agent") New Certificates and cash in
amounts sufficient to allow the Exchange Agent to make all deliveries of
New Certificates and payments that may be required in exchange for Old
Certificates pursuant to this Article II. At the end of such 18-month period,
any such New Certificates and cash remaining in the possession of the
Exchange Agent (together with any dividends or earnings in respect thereof)
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of Old
Certificates who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates for
New Certificates and cash pursuant to this Article II shall thereafter be
entitled to look exclusively to the Surviving Corporation for the shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock (or any unpaid dividends and distributions
thereon) and any cash to which they become entitled upon exchange of their
Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of U.S. Bancorp, Firstar, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
holder of shares of U.S. Bancorp Common Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.   2.2 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. (a) Promptly after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail or deliver to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, a holder of record of U.S. Bancorp Common Stock, a form (mutually
agreed upon by U.S. Bancorp and Firstar) of letter of transmittal containing
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in
exchange for New Certificates and any payments pursuant to this Article II.
Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of an Old Certificate for cancellation
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Old Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a New Certificate
representing the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, and a check in
the amount, if any, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article
II, and the Old Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any amount payable upon surrender
of Old Certificates.   -5-     (b) If any New Certificate is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old
Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the issuance of a New Certificate in any name other than that of
the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered,
or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (c)
After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of Firstar of the shares of Firstar Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (d) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Surviving Corporation.   (e) In the event any Old
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Surviving
Corporation may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Old Certificate the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.   (f) Upon giving effect to the conversion described in
Section 1.4(a), the resulting number of shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock of each registered holder of U.S. Bancorp Common Stock shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number and each such registered holder
shall be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation in lieu of any
fractional share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock prior to such rounding
down an amount (without interest) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the fraction of a share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled and (ii) the average of the

Firstar is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Wisconsin. Firstar has the corporate
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Firstar.
As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with
respect to U.S. Bancorp, Firstar or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, operations, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole, except to the extent such effect is attributable to the execution of
this Agreement and the announcement thereof or (ii) the ability of such party
to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this
Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" means "Significant Subsidiary" as defined in
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") with respect to either party hereto or any entity of which at
least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by their
terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or
similar governing body are owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such
party. Firstar is duly registered as a bank holding company and has become a
financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (the "BHC Act"), and meets the requirements of Section 4(l) of the
BHC Act.   (b) Each Firstar Subsidiary (i) is duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly
qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether
federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property
or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which
the failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect on
Firstar and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted.   3.2 CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of Firstar
consists of (i) 2,000,000,000 shares of Firstar Common Stock, of which, as of

outstanding shares of Firstar Common Stock have been duly authorized and

Stock (collectively, including the items contemplated by clauses (i) through

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on U.S.
Bancorp.   (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the shareholder approval or consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) (i) result
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events) in any
payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation,

Bancorp and Firstar shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, and U.S. Bancorp and Firstar shall thereafter mail or deliver
the Joint Proxy Statement to their respective shareholders. U.S. Bancorp
shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Firstar shall furnish all
information concerning Firstar and the holders of Firstar Common Stock as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.   (b) The
parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best
efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect
all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the Merger) and the Option Agreements, and to comply with
the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all such Governmental Entities. U.S. Bancorp and
Firstar shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing rights of review and consultation, each of the
parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The
parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all

other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of U.S.
Bancorp, Firstar or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   (d) U.S. Bancorp and Firstar shall promptly advise
each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity
whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Option Agreements that causes such
party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite
Regulatory    -27-      Approval (as defined in Section 7.1(c)) will
not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially
delayed.   6.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each of U.S.
Bancorp and Firstar, for the purposes of verifying the representations and
warranties of the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such
period, each of U.S. Bancorp and Firstar shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports or
documents that U.S. Bancorp or Firstar, as the case may be, is not permitted
to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning
its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request.
Neither U.S. Bancorp nor Firstar nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide such access or to disclose such information
where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of U.S.
Bancorp\'s or Firstar\'s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.   (b) Each of U.S. Bancorp and Firstar shall hold
all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such
party\'s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of confidentiality agreement, dated September 30, 2000, between U.S. Bancorp
and Firstar (the "Confidentiality Agreement").   (c) No investigation by
either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein.   6.3

directors of each of Firstar and U.S. Bancorp shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from such shareholders the vote in favor of the approval of
this Agreement required by the WBCL, in the case of Firstar, or by the DGCL
and, as applicable, the rules of the NYSE, in the case of U.S. Bancorp, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; PROVIDED that the use of
such reasonable best efforts shall not be deemed to require a party to
maintain in place a recommendation that such party\'s shareholders adopt this
Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby to the extent such
action is inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of such party\'s board of
directors under applicable law.     -28-       6.4 LEGAL CONDITIONS
TO MERGER. Each of U.S. Bancorp and Firstar shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with
all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries
with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in
Article VII, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to
obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by Firstar or U.S. Bancorp or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   6.5 AFFILIATES; PUBLICATION OF COMBINED
FINANCIAL RESULTS. (a) Each of U.S. Bancorp and Firstar shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other
person who is an "affiliate" (as applicable, for purposes of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act and for purposes of qualifying the Merger for "pooling of
interests" accounting treatment) of such party to deliver to the other party
hereto, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and prior to
the date of the shareholders\' meetings called by U.S. Bancorp and Firstar to
approve this Agreement, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit 6.5(a)(1)
or (2), as applicable, hereto, providing that such person will not sell,
pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of U.S. Bancorp Common
Stock or Firstar Common Stock held by such "affiliate" and, in the case of
the "affiliates" of Firstar, the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
to be received by such "affiliate" in the Merger.   (b) The Surviving
Corporation shall use its best efforts to publish as promptly as reasonably
practical, but in no event later than 90 days after the end of the first
month after the Effective Time in which there are at least 30 days of post-
Merger combined operations (which month may be the month in which the
Effective Time occurs), combined sales and net income figures as contemplated
by and in accordance with the terms of SEC Accounting Series Release No.
135.   6.6 STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING. U.S. Bancorp shall cause the shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Effective Time.   6.7 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, unless otherwise mutually determined, the Firstar
Benefit Plans and U.S. Bancorp Benefit Plans in effect as of the date of this
Agreement shall remain in effect with respect to employees of Firstar or U.S.
Bancorp (or their Subsidiaries), respectively, covered by such plans at the
Effective Time until such time as the Surviving Corporation shall, subject to
applicable law, the terms of this Agreement and the terms of such plans,
adopt new benefit plans with respect to employees of the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "New Benefit Plans"). Prior to the
Closing Date, Firstar and U.S. Bancorp shall cooperate in reviewing,
evaluating and analyzing the U.S. Bancorp Benefit Plans and Firstar Benefit
Plans with a view towards developing appropriate New Benefit Plans for the
employees covered thereby. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will recognize the prior service with U.S. Bancorp,
Firstar or their respective Subsidiaries of each employee of U.S. Bancorp,
Firstar or any of their respective subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the
"Employees") in connection with all employee benefit plans in which such
Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting      -29-        and levels of
benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan). From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility
waiting periods under any group health plans of Surviving Corporation to be
waived with respect to the Employees and their eligible dependents (to the
extent such conditions, limitations or waiting periods have been otherwise
satisfied under the applicable U.S. Bancorp Benefit Plan or Firstar Benefit
Plan) and (ii) give each Employee credit for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket
limits for eligible expenses incurred under the applicable U.S. Bancorp
Benefit Plan or Firstar Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.   (b) The
foregoing notwithstanding, the Surviving Corporation agrees to honor and
cause to be paid in accordance with their terms all benefits vested as of the
Effective Time under the Firstar Benefit Plans and the U.S. Bancorp Benefit
Plans, including change-of-control benefits related to the Merger as required
by plans and agreements as in effect on the date hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that, with respect to the U.S. Bancorp Benefit Plans, the U.S. Bancorp board
of directors or the appropriate committee thereof has taken all
action necessary (to the extent such action is not inconsistent with Section
5.2(i)) to deem the transactions contemplated hereby to be no more than a
"partial change of control" for purposes of each U.S. Bancorp Benefit Plan to
which such concept applies, including those set forth in Section 6.7(b) of
the U.S. Bancorp Disclosure Schedule, and has not and shall not cause or
permit the funding of any rabbi or grantor trust associated with any U.S.
Bancorp Benefit Plan.   (c) Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be interpreted
as preventing the Surviving Corporation from amending, modifying or
terminating any U.S. Bancorp Benefit Plans, Firstar Benefit Plans, or other
contracts, arrangements, commitments or understandings, in accordance with
their terms and applicable law.   6.8 INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS\' AND
OFFICERS\' INSURANCE. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation in which any individual who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of Firstar, U.S. Bancorp or
any of their respective subsidiaries, (the "Indemnified Parties"), is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or
was a director, officer or employee of U.S. Bancorp or Firstar or any of
their subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii)
this Agreement, the Option Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best
efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed
that after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and
hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law upon receipt of any
undertaking required by applicable law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.    -30-       (b) The Surviving
Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the individuals
serving as officers and directors of U.S. Bancorp, Firstar, and each of their
respective subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered
for a period of six years from the Effective Time (or the period of the
applicable statute of limitations, if longer) by the directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy maintained by U.S. Bancorp (PROVIDED
that Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers
and directors in their capacity as such.   (c) In the event the Surviving
Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.   (d) The provisions
of this Section 6.8 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and
his or her heirs and representatives.   6.9 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. In case
at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, any merger between a Subsidiary of Firstar, on the one hand, and
a Subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by, and at the sole expense of, Firstar.   6.10 ADVICE OF CHANGES.
U.S. Bancorp and Firstar shall each promptly advise the other party of any
change or event (i) having a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it
believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a failure
of any of the conditions to consummation of the Merger contained herein.  
6.11 DIVIDENDS. After the date of this Agreement, each of U.S. Bancorp
and Firstar shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends
in respect of U.S. Bancorp Common Stock and Firstar Common Stock and the
record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of
the parties hereto that holders of neither Firstar Common Stock nor U.S.
Bancorp Common Stock shall receive two dividends, or fail to receive one
dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares of Firstar Common
Stock or U.S. Bancorp Common Stock, as the case may be, and any shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange
therefor in the Merger. It is understood that the parties intend that the
first regular quarterly dividend of Surviving Corporation following
consummation of the Merger shall be increased in accordance with past
practices, subject to approval by the board of directors.

connection with the Merger by the shareholders of U.S. Bancorp or
Firstar:   (a) by mutual consent of U.S. Bancorp and Firstar in a
written instrument, if the board of directors of each so determines by a vote
of a majority of the members of its entire board;   (b) by either the board

issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;   (c) by either the board of directors of U.S. Bancorp or
the board of directors of Firstar if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the date that is nine months after the date of this
Agreement, unless the failure of the Closing (as defined in Section 9.1) to

terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements
of such party set forth herein; or   (d) by either the board of directors
of U.S. Bancorp or the board of directors of Firstar (PROVIDED that the
terminating party is not then in breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a
breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or
warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of Firstar, in the case of
a termination by U.S. Bancorp, or U.S. Bancorp, in the case of a termination
by Firstar, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would
constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3, as the case may be, and that
is not cured within 45 days following written notice to the party committing
such breach or by its nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the Closing
Date.   8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this

or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature
whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that (i) Sections 6.2(b), 8.2, 9.2 and 9.3 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither U.S. Bancorp nor Firstar shall
be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.    -35-       8.3
AMENDMENT. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by
their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of U.S.
Bancorp and Firstar; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the respective shareholders of
U.S. Bancorp or Firstar, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the
form of the consideration to be delivered hereunder to the holders of U.S.

this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   8.4 EXTENSION;

the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any

any portion thereof that reduces the amount or changes the form of the
consideration to be delivered to the holders of U.S. Bancorp Common Stock
or Firstar Common Stock hereunder, other than as contemplated by this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.   ARTICLE IX   GENERAL PROVISIONS   9.1 CLOSING. Subject
