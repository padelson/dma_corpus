1.1 Purchase and Sale.

  

  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing
(as defined below):

  

  

(a) The Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to the Buyer,
and the Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Seller, the
Membership Interests; and

  

  

(b) The Buyer shall pay to the Seller, in consideration for the Membership
Interests, $510,000,000, (the "Purchase Price"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Seller
prior to the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

The transactions contemplated by this Section 1.1 are sometimes referred to in
aggregate as the "Purchase."

  


 

  

1.2 Conversion of the Company. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Seller
has caused the Company to be converted into a Delaware limited liability
company in accordance with Delaware law, with all related documents and
instruments to be in form and substance mutually satisfactory to the Seller
and the Buyer in their respective reasonable judgments. Following the
effectiveness of the conversion of the Company into a limited liability
company and thereafter, neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates has made
or will make an election or take any action resulting in the Company being
treated as anything other than an entity disregarded from its owner for United
States federal and state income Tax purposes, and the Seller and its
Affiliates will file all income Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such
disregarded entity status. The parties agree that for United States federal
and state income Tax purposes the purchase of the interests in a disregarded
entity will be treated as a purchase of the assets of the Company.

  

  

1.3 Purchase Price Allocation. At least three business days before Closing,
the Buyer shall provide to the Seller a schedule setting forth a proposal for
an allocation of a portion of the Purchase Price (including any assumed
liabilities) among the classes of company assets on IRS Form 8594 in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Purchase Price Allocation"). At the Closing, the
parties shall mutually agree to the Purchase Price Allocation subject to any
adjustments that may be required pursuant to Sections 1.10 and 4.14. Other
than the adjustments pursuant to Sections 1.10 and 4.14, the Purchase Price
Allocation agreed to at Closing shall be binding on the parties.

  

  

1.4 Time and Place of Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Andrews
Kurth LLP, 600 Travis Street, Suite 4200, Houston, Texas 77002, at 9:00 a.m.
(central time) on a date to be specified by the parties that shall be no later
than two business days after satisfaction (or waiver as provided herein) of
the conditions set forth in Article 5 (other than those conditions that by
their nature will be satisfied at the Closing), unless another time, date
and/or place is agreed to in writing by the parties. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date." Immediately upon
consummation of the Closing, the Buyer shall take title to and ownership of
the Membership Interests.

1.7 Intellectual Property; Marks. The Buyer agrees that it shall not acquire,
nor shall the Company acquire or retain, any rights to the name "Rowan" (or
any variation thereof) or any trademarks, trade names or symbols related
thereto except as specifically contemplated in this Section 1.7. The Buyer
shall as soon as reasonably practicable after Closing, and in any event within
30 days after the Closing, (i) at its own cost remove "Rowan" or any
derivative, extension, abbreviation, variation or indicia thereof or other
similar mark and any trade names, trademarks, identifying logos, service marks
or symbols related thereto or employing the word "Rowan" or any part or
variation of any of the foregoing or any confusingly similar trade names,
trademarks, logos, service marks or symbols (collectively, the "Seller
Trademarks and Logos") from all Rigs and other properties and assets of the
Company, (ii) cease, and not permit any of the Buyer's Affiliates (including
the Company), to use any of the Seller Trademarks and Logos, including in
electronic databases, web sites, product instructions or specifications,
technical documentation, datasheets, brochures, advertising, promotional and
other marketing materials, invoices, letterhead, office forms and business
cards, packaging and other materials, printed or otherwise (all such
materials, together with buildings, signs, other properties and vehicles, the
"Marked Assets"), and (iii) remove "Rowan" from the Company's company name and
registration in accordance with applicable Law. In addition, effective as of
the Closing or within five business days thereafter, the Buyer shall amend the
constitutional and/or organizational documents of the Company to remove all
references therein to the name "Rowan" and to the address of the Seller or any
of its Affiliates. As used in the Agreement, "Affiliate" means, with respect
to any specified person, any other person that, directly or indirectly,
controls, is under common control with, or is controlled by, such specified
person, where the term "control" means, with respect to any person, the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management or policies of such person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

1.8 Books of Minutes. At or as soon as practicable after the Closing, the
Seller shall deliver to the Buyer the limited liability company books of
minutes of meetings of the governing body of the limited liability company and
the corporate minute books of the Company prior to its conversion to a limited
liability company as well as the equity transfer records of the Company. The
Seller may retain copies of any such books of minutes delivered to the Buyer.

  

  

1.9 Intercompany Accounts and Agreements. Except as set forth in Section 1.9
of the Seller Disclosure Letter, at or prior to the Closing, all intercompany
accounts, leases and other agreements between the Company, on the one hand,
and the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other
hand, shall have been canceled, paid or otherwise settled and terminated.
Subject to Section 1.10, no adjustment shall be made to the Purchase Price as
a result of any such cancellations.

  

  

1.10 Distributions; Purchase Price Adjustment.

  

  

(a) The Purchase Price presumes that there is no Company Net Working Capital
on the Closing Date. To the extent that Company Net Working Capital exists,
the Purchase Price will be adjusted upwards or downwards, as appropriate in
accordance with this Section 1.10. Additionally, the parties agree that the
Seller shall have the right, at or prior to the Closing, to cause the Company
to distribute some or all of the Company's cash and working capital to the
Seller by one or more dividends.

  

  

(b) Within 60 calendar days following the Closing, the Seller shall prepare,
or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Buyer a schedule of components of
Company Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date
Schedule") and a statement (the "Closing Statement") reflecting the
calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 1.10(d),
accompanied by a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Seller to
the effect that such statement has, to his or her knowledge, been prepared in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the
"Company Net Working Capital" means the current assets of the Company minus
the current liabilities of the Company, as such terms are customarily referred
to under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
("GAAP") as consistently applied by the Company and the Seller, consistent
with and subject in each case to the Working Capital Methodology; provided,
however, that Company Net Working Capital shall not include income Taxes
payable, income Taxes receivable or deferred income Taxes, liabilities
relating to pension and post retirement obligations, and amounts included in
Section 1.9, to the extent that the same remain the obligations of the Seller.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that Section 1.10(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth the calculation of Company Net Working
Capital as of December 31, 2010. The Company Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date shall be prepared using the same methodology, assumptions,
adjustments, estimates, and accounting policies and principles that were used
to calculate the Company Net Working Capital as of December 31, 2010
(collectively, the "Working Capital Methodology"). The respective amounts
included for any accounts, reserves or accruals that were determined by
estimates in the calculation of Company Net Working Capital as of December 31,
2010 shall not be changed for the calculation of Company Net Working Capital
as of the Closing Date, except to reflect circumstances or events occurring
after December 31, 2010 consistent with the Working Capital Methodology. All
determinations of Company Net Working Capital shall be made disregarding the
effect of any accounting or tax elections or adjustments made at or subsequent
to the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Buyer shall have a period of 30 calendar days after delivery of the
Closing Date Schedule and the Closing Statement to review such documents and
make any objections it may have in writing to the Seller. If such written
objections are delivered to the Seller by the Buyer within such 30-day period,
then the Buyer and the Seller shall attempt to resolve the matter or matters
in dispute and a revised Closing Date Schedule and Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with such discussions. If no written objections are
made by the Buyer within such 30-day period, then such Closing Date Schedule
and Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the parties. If disputes
with respect to such Closing Date Schedule or such Closing Statement cannot be
resolved by the Buyer and the Seller within 30 calendar days after timely
delivery of any objections thereto, then, at the request of the Seller or the
Buyer, the specific matters in dispute shall be submitted to KPMG LLP or such
other independent accounting firm as may be approved by the Buyer and the
Seller (the "Auditors"), which firm shall render its opinion as to such
specific matters. The Auditors shall promptly render their opinion only as to
the specific matters so referred to them, and shall promptly send to the Buyer
and the Seller such opinion and, based on such opinion, the Auditors'
determination of the specified matters in dispute, which determination shall
be final and binding on the parties hereto. The fees and expenses of the
Auditors shall be borne one-half by the Seller and one-half by the Buyer.

  

  

(d) If the Company Net Working Capital reflected on the Closing Date Schedule
as finally determined under Section 1.10(b) is less than zero, then within
five days following the final determination thereof, the Seller shall pay to
the Buyer by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by the Buyer the amount of such deficiency, plus interest
thereon at 5.00% per annum from (and including) the Closing Date to (but
excluding) the date of such payment. If the Company Net Working Capital
reflected on such Closing Date Schedule is greater than zero, then within five
days following the final determination thereof, the Buyer shall pay to the
Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account or
accounts designated by the Seller the amount of such excess, plus interest
thereon at such rate from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding)
the date of such payment.

or any right capable of becoming an enforceable agreement for the purchase,

Seller and any Affiliate thereof shall not own or otherwise retain or possess
any right, title or interest in or to any of the material Intellectual
Property Assets owned by the Company. None of the execution or delivery of
this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or

The Buyer (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (b) has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business substantially as now being
conducted and (c) is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
operation or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing, to
have such power or authority or to be so qualified would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. As used in this
Agreement, the term "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" shall mean an event,
change or circumstance that would adversely affect the ability of the Buyer to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

3.2 Authority. The Buyer has the corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby by the Buyer have been duly and validly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Buyer. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Buyer.

  

  

3.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except for applicable requirements
of Antitrust Regulations and except for a post-closing notice filing under
Canadian National Instrument 51-102 - Continuous Disclosure Obliations (the
"BAR Requirements"), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Buyer nor the consummation by the Buyer of the transactions contemplated
hereby will conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the
corporate charter, bylaws or equivalent governing documents of the Buyer or
any of its subsidiaries, result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, or require
any consent under, any indenture, license, contract, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which the Buyer or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets
are bound, violate any Law that is currently in effect and applicable to the
Buyer, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, or require any filing with, or the obtaining of any permit,
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity, except in the
case of clauses (b), (c) and (d) of this Section 3.3 for any such violations,
breaches, defaults, rights of termination, cancellation or acceleration or
requirements that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect, or that become applicable as a result of any acts or
omissions by, or the status of or any facts pertaining to, the Seller and the
Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24

hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the

and to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer
acknowledges that its obligations to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not subject to the availability to the Buyer or any other
person of financing.

  

  

3.6 Litigation. There is no claim, action, suit, proceeding or, to the
knowledge of the Buyer, governmental investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of the Buyer, threatened against the Buyer or any of its
subsidiaries by or before any court or Governmental Entity that, individually
or in the aggregate, would have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

3.7 Investigation by the Buyer; No Reliance; Seller's Liability. The Buyer has
conducted its own independent review and analysis of the Rigs, including their
location, and the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and the Company
Business and acknowledges that the Buyer has been provided access to the

representatives) in "data rooms," management presentations or supplemental due
diligence information provided to the Buyer (including its directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives) in
connection with discussions or access to management of the Company Business or
in any other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, "Due Diligence Information"); and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that none of the Seller,
the Company or any of their respective members, directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, Affiliates, agents, advisors or representatives shall
have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to the Buyer or its directors,
officers, shareholders, employees, Affiliates, agents, advisors or
representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities laws or otherwise) resulting from the distribution to the
Buyer, or the Buyer's use of, any Due Diligence Information, except that the
foregoing limitations shall not apply to the extent the Seller makes the
specific representations and warranties set forth in Article 2 of this
Agreement, but always subject to the limitations and restrictions contained in
this Agreement.

  

  

3.8 Brokers; Finders and Fees. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has

Laws) by a Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Seller or any such

comply with the obligations of the Seller under this Agreement; provided,
however, that in the event that the Buyer reasonably determines that any such
provision of access or information could be commercially detrimental, violate
any Law or agreement, or waive any attorney-client privilege, the parties
shall take all reasonable measures to permit the compliance with such
obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence.

other's counsel such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other party may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission that is necessary under the Antitrust Regulations. The Seller and
the Buyer shall consult with each other as to the appropriate time of making
such filings and submissions and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
make such filings and submissions at the agreed upon time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer and the Seller shall file for approval under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, within ten
business days after the date of this Agreement and shall seek early
termination of the associated waiting period (unless otherwise agreed by their
legal counsel) and to cooperate with the other parties to the extent
reasonably necessary to assist in making reasonable supplemental presentations
to the applicable Governmental Entities and, if requested by such entities, to
promptly amend or furnish additional information thereunder.

  

  

(c) The Seller and the Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of
any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, Governmental Entities and shall comply promptly with any
such inquiry or request. The Seller and the Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to defend, lift and appeal and mitigate the effect of any
Legal Proceeding adversely affecting this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) If reasonably necessary to satisfy local Legal Requirements, each party
hereto shall enter into separate agreements and other conveyance documents as
needed to effectuate the Transactions, provided that the terms of such other
agreements and documents do not alter in any material respect the rights and
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as set
forth in Section 4.3(a) with respect to antitrust approvals, (i) neither the
Seller or the Company on the one hand or the Buyer and its Affiliates on the
other hand shall be required to take any action in connection with satisfying
its obligations to obtain consents if such actions would require such Person
to make any material payments or suffer any material burden on such Person in
order to obtain any consent; and (ii) without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, neither the Seller nor the Company will, in seeking to obtain any such
consents, agree to amend, modify, terminate or waive any rights under the
applicable contracts to which such consents relate or otherwise require the
Company to make any payments or suffer any burden in connection therewith.

  

  

(f) The parties acknowledge that prior to the Closing Date, the Seller or its
Affiliates has or will furnish certain administrative, management, accounting
and operational services to the Company Business. Such services shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date, except that, at the Buyer's option, the
Seller or its Affiliates shall continue some or all of such services for up to
90 days after the Closing Date under the Transition Services Agreement with
customary terms, and providing for the Buyer to reimburse the Seller for such
services beginning immediately after the Closing at the Seller's actual cost
plus ten percent and providing for the Seller to bill the Buyer for such
services promptly following the end of each month during which such services
are rendered.

  

  

4.4 Notification. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, each
party shall promptly notify the other parties hereto in writing if such party
becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or constitutes a material
breach of any of its representations and warranties as of the date of this
Agreement, or if such party becomes aware of the occurrence after the date of
this Agreement of any fact or condition that would (except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a material breach of any
such representation or warranty of such party had such representation or
warranty been made as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or
condition; provided, however, that such disclosure shall not be deemed to cure
any material breach of a representation or warranty. During the same period,
each party to this Agreement will promptly notify the other parties hereto of
the occurrence of any material breach of any covenant or agreement by such
party in this Agreement or of the occurrence of any event that may make the
satisfaction of the conditions in Article 5 impossible or unlikely; provided,
however, that such disclosure shall not be deemed to cure any material breach
of a covenant or agreement or to satisfy a condition. Each party to this
Agreement shall promptly notify the other parties of the threat or
commencement of any Legal Proceeding before the Closing that could in any way
affect the ability of such party to consummate the transaction.

  

  

4.5 No Negotiation. From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the
Closing Date or the date on which this Agreement is earlier terminated,
neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives
shall, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or
proposals from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any information to or
consider any inquiries or proposals from, any Person (other than the Buyer and
its Affiliates and representatives) relating to any transaction involving the
sale of all or any portion of the Company Business, whether affected by sale
of assets, sale of equity interests, merger or otherwise. The Seller shall (i)
ensure that its subsidiaries, Affiliates and representatives are aware of the
provisions of this Section 4.5, and (ii) be responsible for any breaches by
any such parties of this Section 4.5. At or prior to Closing, the Seller shall
request and require the return or destruction of all confidential information
concerning the Company Business or the Company made available to any third
party (other than the Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives) since
January 1, 2010 with respect to or in connection with any inquiries, proposals
or access to information prior to the Closing Date and of a type described in
the first sentence of this Section 4.5 to the full extent provided in the
confidentiality agreement entered into between the Seller and/or the Company
and such third party in connection therewith. In addition, the Seller shall
not release any such third party from any such confidentiality agreement (or
any obligation thereunder) or waive, amend or alter any of such third party's
obligations thereunder and, at the reasonable request and expense of the Buyer
enforce the terms of such confidentiality agreement against such third party
and assign to the Buyer (to the extent assignable without the consent of such
third party) the Seller's rights thereunder as it relates to the Company
Business and the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or limit
the Seller's rights to engage in any discussions with respect to the Seller or
any of its subsidiaries, assets or businesses, other than the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

4.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Each of the Seller and the Buyer shall
cooperate, and use its commercially reasonable efforts, to take, or cause to
be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

4.7 Public Announcements. Prior to but not after the Closing, except as set
forth herein or otherwise agreed to by the parties, the parties shall not
issue any report, statement or press release or otherwise make any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except as in the reasonable judgment of the party may be
required by Law or in connection with its or any of its Affiliate's
obligations as a publicly-held, exchange-listed company, in which case the
parties shall take all reasonable measures to consult with each other as to
the language of any such report, statement or press release.

  

  

4.8 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Indemnification.

  

  

(i) The Seller shall indemnify the Buyer from, against and in respect of any
Taxes imposed on the Company with respect to any taxable period, or portion
thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date, but not including (A) any
Transfer Taxes or ad valorem Taxes for which the Buyer is liable under Section
4.8(e), and (B) any Taxes that were taken into account in determining the
Company Net Working Capital under Section 1.10(b).

  

  

(ii) The Buyer shall indemnify the Seller from, against and in respect of any
liability of the Seller for (A) any Taxes imposed on the Company with respect
to any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date,
(B) any liability of the Seller or its subsidiaries for any Transfer Taxes or
ad valorem Taxes for which the Buyer is liable under Section 4.8(e) and (C)
any Taxes that were taken into account in determining the Company Net Working
Capital under Section 1.10(b).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) Each of the Seller and the Buyer agrees to treat any indemnity payment
made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Laws.

  

  

(b) Allocation of Taxes. To the extent permitted by Law or administrative
practice, the taxable years of the Company shall end at the close of business
on the Closing Date. Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for
Taxes of the Company for a portion of a taxable year or period that begins
before and ends after the Closing Date, the determination of the Taxes for the
portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period
beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the
taxable year or period ended at the close of business on the Closing Date,
except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis and Taxes imposed on the ownership, use or operation of real or
personal property shall be prorated on the basis of the number of days in the
annual period elapsed through the Closing Date as compared to the number of
days in the annual period elapsing after the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) Tax Returns. Except as provided in Section 4.8(e):

  

  

(i) The Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed when due Tax Returns with respect to the Company for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date.

  

  

(ii) The Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed when due all other Tax Returns with respect to the Company.

  

  

(iii) The Buyer shall provide the Seller with copies of all Tax Returns filed,
or caused to be filed, by the Buyer with respect to the Company for periods
beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing, and the
Seller shall provide the Buyer with copies of all Tax Returns filed, or caused
to be filed, after the Closing Date by the Seller with respect to the Company.

  

  

(iv) The other party (the "Payor") shall have the option of providing to the
party responsible under this Agreement for filing such return (the
"Preparer"), at any time at least 15 days prior to the Due Date, written
instructions as to how the Payor wants any, or all, of the items for which it
may be liable reflected on such Tax Return. The Preparer shall, in preparing
such return, cause the items for which the Payor is liable under this
Agreement to be reflected in accordance with the Payor's instructions (unless,
in the opinion of a partner of an internationally recognized law or accounting
firm retained by the Preparer, complying with the Payor's instructions would
likely subject the Preparer to any civil or criminal penalty on any such item)
and, in the absence of having received such instructions, in accordance with
past practice. The Payor shall pay to the Preparer the amount of the Taxes
with respect to such Tax Return for which the Payor is liable not later than
30 days after such Tax Return is filed.

  

  

(v) If the Preparer fails to satisfy its obligations under this Section
4.8(c), the Payor shall have no obligation to indemnify the Preparer for any
incremental Taxes that are reflected on any such Tax Return as a result of
such failure or any related Loss, and shall retain any and all remedies it may
otherwise have that arise out of such failure.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Tax Contests. The Buyer shall inform the Seller of the commencement of any
audit, examination or proceeding ("Tax Contest") relating in whole or in part
to Taxes for which the Buyer may be entitled to indemnity from the Seller
hereunder. With respect to any Tax Contest for which the Seller acknowledges
in writing that the Seller is liable under Section 4.8(a) for all losses
relating thereto, the Seller shall be entitled to control, in good faith, all
proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Contest with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Buyer; provided, however, that (x) the Seller shall
promptly notify the Buyer in writing of the Seller's intention to control such
Tax Contest, (y) in the case of a Tax Contest relating to Taxes of the Company
for a Tax period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall control all proceedings taken in connection with any such Tax Contest,
and (z) if any Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on the Seller or the Company, in any Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date, the Tax Contest shall not be settled or resolved without the
Seller's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The Buyer and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
the Seller with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Seller
in connection with a Tax Contest controlled solely by the Seller.

  

  

(e) Transfer Taxes. All excise, sales, use, value added, transfer (including
real property transfer or gains), stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and
other similar taxes, levies, assessments, customs, duties, imposts, charges or
fees, together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto
and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties, resulting directly
from the sale and transfer by the Seller to the Buyer of the Membership
Interests (the "Transfer Taxes") shall be borne fully by the Buyer. Without
limiting or altering the Buyer's sole responsibility to pay all Transfer
Taxes, the Buyer and the Seller agree to cooperate in (i) determining the
amount of Transfer Taxes; (ii) providing all requisite exemption certificates;
and (iii) preparing and timely filing any and all required Tax Returns for or
with respect to such Transfer Taxes with any and all Governmental Entities.

  

  

(f) Income Tax Treatment of Transaction

  

  

. Prior to the Closing, the Company will become a disregarded entity for
United States federal income Tax purposes and relevant state income Tax
purposes. Accordingly, the parties intend that for United States federal
income Tax purposes and for state income Tax purposes, (i) the Company will be
treated as completely liquidating in a nontaxable transaction pursuant to
Sections 332 and 337 of the Code, (ii) the purchase and sale hereunder of the
Membership Interest in the Company as a single-member limited liability
company will be treated as a taxable sale by the Seller of the assets of the
Company to the Buyer, and a purchase of such assets by the Buyer from the
Seller, for the Purchase Price and the assumption of liabilities of the
Company, and (iii) the Company shall have completed a plan of complete
liquidation of the Company for United States federal income Tax purposes
pursuant to Section 332 of the Code. The parties agree not to take any
position inconsistent with such intended Tax consequences, including any
action that would cause the Company (as a limited liability company) to become
taxable as a corporation or to reincorporate.

  

  

(g) Buyer's Claiming, Receiving or Using of Refunds, Overpayments and
Prepayments. If, after the Closing, the Buyer or the Company (A) receives any
refund (whether by payment, offset, credit or otherwise) or (B) utilizes the
benefit of any overpayment of Taxes that, in each case (A) and (B), (x)
relates to Taxes for which the Seller is liable or paid by the Seller or the
Company with respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or
before the Closing Date or (y) is the subject of indemnification by the Seller
under this Agreement, the Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause to be
transferred, to the Seller the entire amount of the refund or overpayment
(including interest) received or utilized by the Buyer or the Company. For
purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, a prepayment made by the
Seller or the Company on or before the Closing Date of Taxes for which the
Buyer is liable shall be treated in the same manner as an overpayment of Taxes
for which the Seller is liable. The Buyer agrees to notify the Seller within
15 days following the discovery of a right to claim any such refund or
overpayment and the receipt of any such refund or utilization of any such
overpayment. The Buyer agrees to claim any such refund or to utilize any such
overpayment as soon as possible and to furnish the Seller all information,
records and assistance necessary to verify the amount of the refund or
overpayment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) Post-Closing Actions That Affect the Seller's Liability for Taxes. None of
the Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall take any
action (including amending any Tax Return) on or after the Closing Date that
could materially increase the Seller's liability for Taxes (including any
liability of the Seller to indemnify the Buyer for Taxes under this
Agreement), without the prior written consent of the Seller. The Buyer shall
not cause the Company to waive or extend any statute of limitations for Taxes
without the prior written consent of the Seller.

  

  

(i) No Carryback of Tax Attributes. The Buyer shall elect to waive any right
to carry back any net operating loss of the Company which arises in a Tax year
or portion thereof beginning on or after the Closing Date to any Tax year and
period ending on or before the Closing Date under Section 172(b)(3) of the
Code and Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-21(b)(3)(ii)(B) (and any similar
provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law).

  

  

(j) Assistance and Cooperation. The Buyer and the Seller agree that, after the
Closing Date:

  

  

(i) The Buyer and the Seller shall assist (and cause its respective Affiliates
to assist) the other party in preparing any Tax Returns that such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing;

  

  

(ii) The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate fully in preparing for any Tax
Audits, or disputes with taxing authorities, relating to any Tax Returns or
Taxes of the Company, including providing access to relevant books and records
relating to Taxes at issue;

  

  

(iii) The Buyer and the Seller shall make available to each other and to any
taxing authority as reasonably requested all relevant books and records
relating to Taxes;

  

  

(iv) The Buyer and the Seller shall promptly furnish the other party with
copies of all relevant correspondence received from any taxing authority in
connection with any Tax Audit or information request relating to Taxes for
which such other party may have an indemnification obligation under this
Agreement; and

  

  

(v) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the party requesting
assistance or cooperation shall bear the other party's out-of-pocket expenses
in complying with such request to the extent that those expenses are
attributable to fees and other costs of unaffiliated third-party service
providers.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(k) This Section 4.8 contains the exclusive provisions as to all Tax
indemnification claims. Article 7 shall not apply to Tax indemnification
claims.

  

  

(l) For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" shall mean (i) taxes of
any kind, levies or other like assessments, customs, duties, imposts, charges
or fees, including income taxes, gross receipts, ad valorem, value added,
excise, real or property, asset, sales, use, license, payroll, transaction,
capital, net worth, withholding, estimated, social security, utility, workers'
compensation, severance, production, unemployment compensation, occupation,
premium, windfall profits, transfer and gains taxes or other governmental
taxes imposed or payable to the United States, or any state, county, local or
foreign government or subdivision or agency thereof, together with any
interest, penalties or additions with respect thereto and any interest in
respect of such additions or penalties; (ii) any liability for payment of
amounts described in clause (i) whether as a result of transferee liability,
of being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group
for any period or otherwise through operation of law; and (iii) any liability
for the payment of amounts described in clauses (i) or (ii) as a result of any
tax sharing, tax indemnity or tax allocation agreement or any other express or
implied agreement to indemnify any other Person with respect thereto; "Due
Date" shall mean, with respect to any Tax Return, the date such return is due
to be filed (taking into account any valid extensions); and "Tax Item" shall
mean, with respect to Taxes, any item of income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit or other tax attribute.

  

  

4.9 Buyer's Knowledge of Breach. If, prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall
have actual knowledge of any breach of a representation and warranty of the
Seller, the Buyer shall promptly notify the Seller of the Buyer's knowledge,
in reasonable detail, including the amount that the Buyer believes, based on
the facts actually known by it, would be payable by the Seller under the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement without reference to any
indemnification limitations set forth in Section 7.2 of this Agreement.

  

  

4.10 Employees; Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) Offer of Employment. The Buyer hereby agrees that, prior to the Closing
Date, an Affiliate of the Buyer will extend an offer of employment to not
fewer than 95% of the Seller Assigned Employees in accordance with the terms
of this Section 4.10. Any Seller Assigned Employee who receives an offer of
employment from the Buyer's Affiliate but does not accept such offer will not
be eligible for any severance benefit under any Seller Benefit Plan. Any
Seller Assigned Employee who accepts such offer of employment with the Buyer's
Affiliate is herein referred to as a "Transferring Employee." All Transferring
Employees' service with the Seller or its Affiliates will be terminated by the
Seller or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date.

  

  

At least five business days before the Closing, the Buyer shall furnish to the
Seller a list of the names of any Seller Assigned Employees who will not
receive an offer of employment from the Buyer's Affiliate, and the Seller
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to retain such employees. Any
employees so retained are herein referred to as "Seller Retained Employees".
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the three employees listed on Section 4.10(a)
of the Seller Disclosure Letter may remain as Seller Retained Employees if
they so choose, in their sole discretion. The Seller will be responsible for
any change of control payment due to any employee of the Seller (or one or
more of the Seller's Affiliates) in connection with this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Any employee who is not given an offer of employment by the Buyer's Affiliate
and who is not a Seller Retained Employee will be terminated by the Seller on
or before the Closing Date ("Terminated Employees"), and the Seller is
obligated to pay any and all severance obligations under the seller severance
plan (the "Seller Severance Plan") for all such Terminated Employees.

  

  

The terms of any offer of employment by the Buyer's Affiliate to a Seller
Assigned Employee shall be at least at substantially the same base salary or
hourly rate of pay, as applicable, and bonus opportunity, in each case as
exists on the date of this Agreement, and such terms shall recognize each
Seller Assigned Employee's years of service, seniority and tenure with the
Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date in all respects, including
for purposes of terms of employment and eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual,
and bonus determination.

  

  

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall affect the ability of Buyer's
Affiliate to alter the terms, conditions or wages of any Transferring
Employee's employment after a period of twelve months following the Closing
Date; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right
of Buyer's Affiliate at any time after the Closing Date to alter the terms,
conditions or wages of such Transferring Employees, if consistent with the
policies and procedures concerning the Buyer's or its Affiliates' other
employees or to adjust such terms or conditions due to a downturn in the
Company Business, the condition of the industry, the termination of customer
contracts, or for any other valid business purpose, including but not limited
to compliance with any federal immigration law or any applicable state law
that penalizes a business that fails to use the federal EVerify system.

  

  

(b) Buyer Benefit Plans. From and after the Closing Date, the Transferring
Employees shall be covered under employee compensation and benefit plans,
policies, programs or arrangements as the Company, the Buyer or an Affiliate
of the Buyer, shall make available (the "Buyer Benefit Plans") in accordance
with the requirements of Section 4.10(a). The Buyer shall cause the Buyer
Benefit Plans, for purposes of determining a Transferring Employee's
eligibility to participate, vesting and eligibility for benefits, to recognize
the service, seniority and tenure that is recognized by the Seller or its
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Transferring Employees
shall have substantially the same benefits as similarly situated employees of
the Buyer or its Affiliates. The Buyer or its Affiliates shall cause there to
be waived for such Transferring Employees any waiting periods and actively-at-
work requirements to the extent necessary to provide immediate coverage under
such plans. The Buyer, its Affiliates or the Company shall be solely
responsible for all benefits accruing to the Transferring Employees under the
Buyer Benefit Plans.

  

  

(c) Welfare Plans. The Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company) shall
be liable for claims for benefits (other than for short-term disability,
workers' compensation and medical benefits) by Transferring Employees under
each welfare benefit plan sponsored by the Seller or its Affiliates
(including, but not limited to, The Group Life and Health Insurance Plan of
Parent Companies, Inc. (inclusive of its constituent plans)) arising out of
occurrences on or prior to the Closing Date. The Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Company) shall be liable for claims for short-term disability
benefits and workers' compensation benefits by Transferring Employees under
such welfare benefit plans with respect to payments otherwise due on or prior
to the Closing Date. The Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company)
shall be liable for claims for medical benefits by Transferring Employees
under such welfare benefit plans with respect to services and treatment
rendered on or prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer or its Affiliates shall
provide welfare benefit coverages for the Transferring Employees for which the
Seller or its Affiliates are not otherwise liable. The Buyer or its Affiliates
shall cause each of the Transferring Employees to be granted credit under its
health benefit plans, for the year during which the Closing Date occurs, with
any deductibles, co-insurance payments and out-of-pocket expenses already
incurred by such Transferring Employees for such year under the plans of the
Seller or its Affiliates, and the Buyer or its Affiliates shall cause there to
be waived for such Transferring Employees any preexisting condition
restrictions, evidence of insurability, exclusions, waiting periods and
actively at-work requirements, under its health benefits plans to the extent
necessary to provide immediate coverage under such plans after the Closing
Date. The Buyer shall offer, or shall cause the Company or the Buyer's
Affiliate (as the case may be) to offer, continuation health care coverage to
Transferring Employees after the Closing Date and their qualified
beneficiaries who incur or incurred a qualifying event, in accordance with the
continuation health care coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code
and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA ("COBRA"), after the Closing Date.
The Seller shall be responsible for offering continuation health care coverage
to Transferring Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur or
incurred a qualifying event, in accordance with COBRA, on or before the
Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Cessation of Participation in Seller Benefit Plans. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in Section 4.10, from and after the Closing Date, the
Transferring Employees will accrue no additional benefits under the Seller
Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall retain benefit
obligations under the Seller Benefit Plans to Transferring Employees as set
forth in Section 4.10(d) of the Seller Disclosure Letter. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Section 4.10(d), the Seller (or the applicable
Seller Benefit Plan) shall discharge all obligations to Transferring Employees
(including funding obligations) with respect to benefits accrued prior to the
Closing Date under the Seller Benefit Plans, and neither the Buyer, its
Affiliates nor the Company shall have any liability or responsibility
therefor; provided that neither the Seller nor any of the Seller Benefit Plans
will recognize for any purpose a Transferring Employee's post-Closing
employment with the Company, the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer.

  

  

(e) Retiree Medical Benefits. The Seller, at the Seller's cost, shall be
responsible for the funding of the Retiree Life and Medical Supplement Plan of
the Seller (the "Seller Retiree Medical Plan") for the benefit of Seller
Assigned Employees who are participants in the Seller Retiree Medical Plan and
who are age fifty or older as of the Closing Date. The Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company) shall have no liability whatsoever in
connection with the Seller Retiree Medical Plan.

  

  

(f) Accumulated Vacation, Holiday and Sick Leave. The Seller shall be
responsible for paying Transferring Employees for all accumulated paid time
off days accrued or accumulated by the Transferring Employees but that are
unused as of the Closing Date. The Seller shall pay Transferring Employees for
all such accrued but unused paid time off days prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Pension Plan. The Seller, at the Seller's cost and expense, shall take
such action as is necessary, on or before the Closing Date, to cause each of
the Transferring Employees to have a fully nonforfeitable right in such
Transferring Employee's accrued benefit under the Seller Pension Plan as of
the Closing Date. The Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company) shall
have no liability whatsoever in connection with the Seller Pension Plan

  

  

(h) 401(k) Plan. The Seller shall take such action as is necessary, on or
before the Closing Date, to cause each of the Transferring Employees to have a
fully nonforfeitable right in his account balance under the Parent Savings and
Investment Plan ("Seller's 401(k) Plan") as of the Closing Date. The Seller
and its Affiliates represent, covenant and agree with respect to the Seller's
401(k) Plan, that, as of the Closing Date such plan will satisfy the
requirements of Sections 401(a), (k), and (m) of the Code and will not have
been amended or operated in a way that would adversely affect such qualified
status. The Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company) will not receive
any assets from the Seller's 401(k) plan and will have no liability whatsoever
with respect to such plan.

  

  

(i) No Rights or Amendment. The provisions of this Section 4.10 are for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement only and shall not be construed to
grant any rights, as a third party beneficiary or otherwise, to any person who
is not a party to this Agreement, nor shall any provision of this Agreement be
deemed to be the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan
sponsored or maintained by the Buyer and its Affiliates, or the Seller and its
Affiliates, or otherwise to limit the right of the Buyer or the Seller to
amend, modify or terminate any of their employee benefit plans.

  

  

4.11 Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give the Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the operation of the Company Business prior to Closing and each of the Buyer,
the Seller and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
respective operations prior to Closing.

  

  

4.12 Non-Competition.

  

  

(a) From the Closing Date until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date
(the "Restricted Period"), without the Buyer's consent, the Seller shall not,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries (the Seller and its Subsidiaries, the
"Restricted Party") not to, directly or indirectly (including by means of
management, advisory, operating, or similar agreements or arrangements or by
any record or beneficial equity interest, either as a principal, trustee,
stockholder, partner, joint venture or otherwise, in any Person), engage in a
land-based drilling business that competes with the Company Business, for
their own account or for any other Person, in any state in which the Company
operates the Company Business or otherwise had sales immediately prior to the
Closing (the "Restricted Business"); provided, however, that nothing in this
Agreement or in the definition of Restricted Business shall prohibit or in any
way restrict the Restricted Party's ability to:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) engage in the Restricted Business to the extent necessary to perform its
duties under this Agreement;

  

  

(ii) make or maintain passive investments of less than five percent of the
outstanding equity securities in any entity engaged in the Restricted
Businesses listed for trading on any recognized securities exchange or in the
over-the-counter markets; or

  

  

(iii) acquire the assets or capital stock or other equity interests of or
enter into a merger, consolidation of business combination with any other
Person engaged in the Restricted Business, provided, however, that the net
sales attributable to the Restricted Business conducted by such Person account
for less than 25% of the net sales of such Person for its most recently
completed fiscal year.

  

  

(b) The parties agree that this covenant is personal to the Buyer, and the
Buyer may not assign or otherwise transfer this covenant, in whole or in part,
to any Person other than to other Affiliates of the Buyer. During the
Restricted Period, the Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, directly or
indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any customer, reseller, retailer,
distributor, supplier, licensee or other Person to cease doing business with
the Buyer or the Company or in any way interfere with the relationship between
any such customer, reseller, retailer, distributor, supplier, licensee or
other Person and the Buyer or the Company.

  

  

(c) The Seller agrees that any remedy at law for any breach by it or its
Affiliates of Section 4.12(a) or Section 4.12(b) would be inadequate, and the
Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief in such case
in addition to any other right the Buyer may have, whether at law or in
equity. Each party intends that the provisions of this Section 4.12 be
enforced under the laws applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought. If any provision of this Section 4.12 shall be held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, this Section 4.12 shall
be amended to revise the scope of such provision to make it enforceable, if
possible, or, if not possible, to delete such provision, in either case,
without affecting the other or remaining provisions of this Section 4.12 or
this Agreement. Any invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
Section 4.12 in a jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability
of that provision in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

4.13 Non-Solicitation.

  

  

(a) For a period of 18 months from the date of this Agreement, the Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly
induce or attempt to induce any employee, any consultant or any independent
contractor to discontinue work with the Buyer or in any way knowingly
interfere with the relationship between the Buyer and any employee,
consultant, independent contractor or person employed by the Buyer, nor shall
the Seller contact, approach or solicit any such Persons for the purpose of
hiring.

  

  

(b) For a period of 18 months from the date of this Agreement, the Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly induce or
attempt to induce any employee, any consultant or any independent contractor
to discontinue work with the Seller or in any way knowingly interfere with the
relationship between the Seller and any employee, consultant, independent
contractor or person employed by the Seller, nor shall the Buyer contact,
approach or solicit any such Persons for the purpose of hiring.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that

  

  

(i) the foregoing provision shall not apply to any employee of the Buyer or
the Seller or their respective Affiliates whose annual base compensation is
less than $75,000, and

  

  

(ii) the foregoing provisions shall not prohibit (A) the hiring of a Person
whose employment was terminated by his or her respective employer (or its
Affiliates) and who was not solicited by the other party (or its Affiliates)
in violation of Sections 4.13(a) or 4.12(b), as applicable, or (B)
solicitation by way of general advertising, including general solicitations in
any local, regional or national newspapers or other publications or circulars
or on internet sites or any search firm engagement which is not directed or
focused on employees of the Buyer, or the Seller or their respective
Affiliates, as applicable.

  

  

(d) The parties agree that the restraints created by the covenants in this
Section 4.13 are no greater than necessary to protect the parties' respective
legitimate interests, that damages would be an inadequate remedy and that a
Person seeking to enforce this Section 4.13 shall be entitled to seek specific
performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach hereof.
Furthermore, the parties agree that such covenants do not hinder, or otherwise
cause hardship to, any party or its Affiliates with respect to finding other
employees or any party's or its Affiliates' employees with respect to finding
employment elsewhere. Similarly, the parties agree that no party's need for
the protection afforded by the covenants of this Section 4.13 is outweighed by
either the hardship to any other party or its Affiliates or any public
interest. The existence of any claim or cause of action of a party against
another party, whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not
constitute a defense to the enforcement by a party of the covenants contained
in this Section 4.13. Should any portion of the covenants in this Section 4.13
be held to be wholly or partially invalid or unenforceable because such
portion is held to be overly broad or unreasonable in scope, such holding
shall not invalidate or void the remainder of this Section 4.13 or this
Agreement, and the portions held to be overly broad or unreasonable in scope
shall be revised and reduced in scope so as to be valid and enforceable, and
shall be enforced as so reformed, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

  

  

4.14 Casualty Loss.

  

  

(a) In the event of any fire, explosion, accident, earthquake, act of the
public enemy, act of God, or other similar event or occurrence that results in
damage to, the loss of or the destruction of any Rig or other material Company
asset (a "Casualty Event") that occurs between the date of execution hereof
and the Closing Date and is not a Business Material Adverse Effect, the Seller
shall give the Buyer prompt written notice of the Casualty Event together with
a description of the applicable insurance coverage and an estimate of the
Seller's exposure with respect to such Casualty Event. The Seller shall have
the first right and option to repair or replace the Rig or other material
Company asset with items of equivalent quality and value, at the Seller's sole
cost and expense. If the Seller elects to repair the damage caused by the
relevant Casualty Event or replace the Rig or other material Company asset
damaged or taken, the Seller shall commence such repair or replacement as soon
as reasonably practicable after the occurrence of such Casualty Event,
promptly and diligently continue such efforts until such damaged or taken Rig
or other material Company asset has been fully repaired or replaced with an
item of comparable quality and value, and pay all costs and expenses incurred
in connection therewith. If the Seller elects not to repair or replace the
damaged or taken Rig or other material Company asset, or if the Seller is
unable to repair or replace the damaged or taken Rig or other material Company
asset on or before the Closing Date, the Buyer shall accept the affected Rig
or other material Company asset subject to such unremedied Casualty Event,
proceed to Closing, and receive a reduction in the Purchase Price equal to (i)
the estimated cost to repair the Rig or other material Company asset, as
agreed to by the parties in good faith (the "repair cost"), or, (ii) in the
case of the loss of or destruction of a Rig or other material Company asset,
the greater of the insured value or replacement value of such Rig or other
material Company asset affected by such Casualty Event. If the Purchase Price
is reduced as specified in this Section 4.14(a), the Seller shall be entitled
to retain any and all insurance proceeds.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any reduction in the
Purchase Price be made for ordinary wear and tear occurring prior to the
Closing. If the parties are unable to agree on repair costs within five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall submit the issue to
a recognized firm that is mutually acceptable to the parties (the
"Appraiser"). The Seller and the Buyer shall each submit to the Appraiser
their proposed repair costs together with support calculations and
documentation with respect thereto. The Appraiser shall, prior to Closing,
advise the parties as to its determination of the repair costs. The final
value of such costs of recovery, salvage and repairs as determined in this
Section 4.14(b) shall be the "repair costs" for purposes of this Section 4.14.
The costs of retaining the Appraiser shall be borne equally by the Seller and
the Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, no such casualty loss or damage shall
in any way be considered in the determination of a termination of this
Agreement under Section 6.1 of this Agreement.

Business Material Adverse Effect. If the Buyer closes, nothing in this Section
5.4 shall limit the Buyer's right to indemnification, subject to the
provisions of Article 7.

  

  

ARTICLE 6

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

6.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing only:

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Seller and the Buyer;

  

  

(b) by the Seller or the Buyer by giving written notice to the other party at
any time after six months from the date hereof (the "Outside Date") if the
Closing shall not have occurred by such date, provided, however, (i) that each
of the parties shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to extend the
Outside Date for an additional period of time not to exceed 10 days in the
aggregate if the reason that the Closing has not occurred by such date is that
the condition set forth in Section 5.1(b) has not been satisfied, and (ii)
that the right to terminate this Agreement or to extend the Outside Date
pursuant to this Section 6.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose
breach of any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Closing to occur by the Outside Date;

  

  

(c) by the Seller or the Buyer by giving written notice to the other party if
the other party, has failed to perform its covenants or agreements contained
herein required to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date or has
breached any of its representations or warranties contained herein, in each
case in clause (c) such that the related condition set forth in Article 5
would not be satisfied (assuming for this purpose that the references in
Article 5 to "Closing Date" mean the date of termination pursuant to this
Section 6.1); provided, however, that the defaulting party shall have a period
of ten business days following written notice from the non-defaulting party to
cure any breach of this Agreement, if such breach is curable; or

  

  

(d) by the Seller or the Buyer by giving written notice to the other party if
there shall be any Legal Requirement that makes the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited of if the consummation of
these transactions contemplated by this Agreement would violate any non-
appealable Order of any Governmental Entity having competent jurisdiction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

6.2 Procedure for and Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and abandonment of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Section 6.1, written notice
thereof shall be given by a party so terminating to the other party and this
Agreement shall forthwith terminate and shall become null and void and of no
further effect, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
abandoned without further action by the Seller or the Buyer. If this Agreement
is terminated under Section 6.1:

  

  

(i) the Buyer shall redeliver all documents and other materials of the Seller
or any of its Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether obtained before or after the execution of this Agreement,
to the Seller, and all confidential information received by the Buyer hereto
with respect thereto shall be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement and Section 4.2(b);

  

  

(ii) all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant hereto
shall, at the option of the Seller, and to the extent practicable, be
withdrawn from the agency or other person to which made; and

  

  

(iii) there shall be no liability or obligation under this Agreement on the
part of the Seller or the Buyer or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or representatives, except with
respect to a breach of Section 3.5 of this Agreement by the Buyer and except
that the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be, may have liability to the
other party if the basis of termination is a willful, material breach by the
Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be, of one or more of the provisions of
this Agreement, and except that the obligations provided for in Section
6.1(d), Section 8.4, Section 8.5, Section 8.8 and Section 8.13 of this
Agreement shall survive any such termination.

  

  


 

  

(b) If (i) all of the conditions to Closing in Section 5.1 have been
satisfied, (ii) all of the conditions to Closing in Section 5.2 have been
satisfied or waived by the Seller and (iii) all of the conditions to Closing
in Section 5.3 have been satisfied or waived by the Buyer (other than in each
case those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing), and the Buyer shall fail to pay the Purchase Price as contemplated
by Section 1.6 and take the other actions required to be taken at Closing, and
if any of the obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, then
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would exist and
damages would be difficult to determine, and the Seller shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms of this Agreement and immediate injunctive
relief, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a
remedy, in addition to any other remedy at Law or in equity.

  

  

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 6.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement.

ARTICLE 7

  

  

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

7.1 Survival Periods. All representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall continue until
the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date but, except as provided in
Section 6.2(a)(iii) of this Agreement, shall not survive any termination of
this Agreement; provided that the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2.1 (Organization; Etc. of Seller), Section 2.2 (Authority of Seller),
Section 2.3 (Capitalization), Section 2.4(b) (Ownership), Section 2.10
(Employee Benefit Plans), Section 2.14 (Environmental Matters), Section 3.1
(Organization; Etc. of Buyer), Section 3.2 (Authority of Buyer) (the

until the 36-month anniversary of the Closing Date, all claims for breach of
any other covenant shall survive until the 36-month anniversary of the Closing
Date, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.13 (Taxes)
and Section 4.8 (Tax Matters) shall survive until 60 days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, and the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 2.4(a) (Ownership) shall survive
indefinitely. The covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this
Agreement that by their terms contemplate performance after the Closing,
including without limitation Sections 4.8 and 4.12, shall survive the Closing
until 60 days following the date specified therein, or if no such date is
specified, the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for each
such covenant and agreement. The applicable period set forth above in this
Section 7.1 for each such representation, warranty, covenant and agreement is
referred to herein as the "Survival Period." The parties intend to modify the
statute of limitations and agree that no claims or causes of action may be
brought against the Seller or the Buyer based upon, directly or indirectly,
any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement after the applicable Survival Period or, except as provided in
Section 6.2(a)(iii) of this Agreement, any termination of this Agreement.

  

  

7.2 Seller's Agreement to Indemnify.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
from and after the Closing, the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and
representatives and their successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnitees") from and against all liabilities, demands, claims, deficiencies,
actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages, costs and expenses
(including without limitation, interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses and all reasonable amounts paid in settlement of any of the
foregoing) (collectively, "Buyer Damages") asserted against or incurred by any
Buyer Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or resulting from the following:
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller in this
Agreement; (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or
other obligation of the Seller in this Agreement; (iii) the matters listed in
Section 7.2 of the Seller Disclosure Letter; (iv) any claim for brokerage or
finder's fees or commissions or similar payments based on any agreement or
understanding alleged to have been made in connection with the Purchase; (v)
any Seller Benefit Plans, including without limitation, the Seller Retiree
Medical Plan, the Seller Pension Plan and the Seller Severance Plan; (vi) any
Legal Proceeding or Order applicable to the Company as of the Closing Date, or
(vii) any Indebtedness of the Company to the extent attributable to the
operation of the Company or the Company Business prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The obligation of the Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees under
Section 7.2 is subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(i) No indemnification shall be made by the Seller pursuant to clause (i) of
Section 7.2(a) unless the aggregate amount of Buyer Damages subject to such
clauses exceeds $750,000 (the "Threshold Amount") and, in such event,
indemnification shall be made by the Seller from the first dollar; provided,
however, that any Buyer Damages that individually total less than $100,000
("De Minimis Buyer Losses") shall be excluded in their entirety for all
purposes, including counting towards fulfillment of the Threshold Amount, and
the Seller in no event shall have any liability hereunder to any Buyer
Indemnitees for any such De Minimis Buyer Losses; and provided, further, that
claims for Buyer Damages pursuant to Section 7.2(a) resulting from fraud or
from a breach of the Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties identified in Section 7.1(c) and Section 7.1(d) made by the Seller
shall not be subject to the Threshold Amount, and shall be recoverable from
the first dollar. This Section 7.2(b)(i) shall not apply to claims for
indemnification made pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and
(vii) of Section 7.2(a).

  

  

(ii) In no event shall the Seller's aggregate obligation to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to clause (i) of Section 7.2(a) exceed $40,000,000
in the aggregate, provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to
claims for Buyer Damages pursuant to Section 7.2(a) resulting from fraud or
from a breach of the Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties identified in Section 7.1(c) and Section 7.1(d) made by the Seller.
This Section 7.2(b)(ii) shall not apply to claims for indemnification made
pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of Section 7.2(a).

  

  

(iii) The amount of any Buyer Damages shall be reduced by any amount directly
or indirectly received by a Buyer Indemnitee (including, for this purpose, the
Company) with respect to such Buyer Damages under any insurance coverage or
from any other party alleged to be responsible for such Buyer Damages less any
expenses of recovery, deductibles and/or co-payment. The Buyer Indemnitees
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available
under such insurance coverage and from such other party alleged to have
responsibility. If a Buyer Indemnitee directly or indirectly receives any
amount under insurance coverage or from such other party with respect to Buyer
Damages at any time subsequent to any indemnification provided by, or for the
benefit of, the Seller under this Section 7.2, then such Buyer Indemnitee
shall promptly reimburse the Seller for any payment made or expense incurred
by, or for the benefit of, the Seller in connection with providing such
indemnification up to such amount received by such Buyer Indemnitee less any
expenses of recovery, deductibles and/or co-payments.

  

  

(iv) The Seller shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees only for
those claims giving rise to Buyer Damages as to which the Buyer Indemnitees
have given the Seller written notice thereof prior to the end of the
applicable Survival Period. Any written notice delivered by a Buyer Indemnitee
to the Seller with respect to Buyer Damages shall set forth with as much
specificity as is reasonably practicable the basis of the claim for Buyer
Damages and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of
the amount of such claim.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(v) The Seller shall be entitled to control each of the matters and Legal
Proceedings referenced in clause (iii) of Section 7.2(a), at the Seller's
expense. The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, cooperate with the
Seller in each of such matters and Legal Proceedings and take all actions
reasonably requested by the Seller in connection with such matters and Legal
Proceedings, including the filing of documents in the Legal Proceedings, and
the Seller shall promptly reimburse the Buyer and the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with such
cooperation and actions. Such cooperation shall include access to books,
records and personnel. With respect to such matters and Legal Proceedings
referenced in clause (iii) of Section 7.2(a), the Seller shall be entitled to
all proceeds, if any, received by the Company with respect to such matters and
Legal Proceedings, and the Buyer shall cause the Company to turn over promptly
to the Seller all such proceeds.

  

  

7.3 Buyer's Agreement to Indemnify.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and
representatives and their successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees") from and against all liabilities, demands, claims, deficiencies,
actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, damages, costs and expenses
(including without limitation interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses and all reasonable amounts paid in settlement of any of the
foregoing) (collectively, "Seller Damages") asserted against or incurred by
any Seller Indemnitee to the extent arising out of or resulting from the
following: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Buyer in
this Agreement; (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement
or other obligation of the Buyer in this Agreement; and (iii) the ownership or
operation of the Company, the Company Business and the Rigs after Closing.

  

  

(b) The obligation of the Buyer to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees under
Section 7.3 is subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(i) No indemnification shall be made by the Buyer pursuant to clause (i) of
Section 7.3(a) unless the aggregate amount of Seller Damages subject to such
clauses exceeds the Threshold Amount; provided, however, that any Seller
Damages that individually total less than $100,000 ("De Minimis Seller
Losses") shall be excluded in their entirety for all purposes, including
counting towards fulfillment of the Threshold Amount, and the Seller in no
event shall have any liability hereunder to any Buyer Indemnitees for any such
De Minimis Seller Losses; and provided, further, that claims for Seller
Damages pursuant to Section 7.3(a) resulting from fraud or a breach of the
Fundamental Representations made by the Buyer shall not be subject to the
Threshold Amount, and shall be recoverable from the first dollar. This Section
7.3(b)(i) shall not apply to claims for indemnification made pursuant to
clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section 7.3(a).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) In no event shall the Buyer's aggregate obligation to indemnify the
Seller Indemnitees pursuant to clauses (i) of Section 7.3(a) exceed
$40,000,000 in the aggregate provided, however, that this limitation shall not
apply to claims for Seller Damages pursuant to Section 7.3(a) resulting from
fraud or a breach of the Fundamental Representations made by the Buyer. This
Section 7.3(b)(ii) shall not apply to claims for indemnification made pursuant
to clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section 7.3(a).

  

  

(iii) The amount of any Seller Damages shall be reduced by any amount directly
or indirectly received by a Seller Indemnitee with respect to such Seller
Damages under any insurance coverage or from any other party alleged to be
responsible for such Seller Damages less any expenses of recovery, deductibles
and/or co-payments. The Seller Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect any amounts available under such insurance coverage and
from such other party alleged to have responsibility. If a Seller Indemnitee
directly or indirectly receives any amount under insurance coverage or from
such other party with respect to Seller Damages at any time subsequent to any
indemnification provided by the Buyer under this Section 7.3, then such Seller
Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the Buyer for any payment made or expense
incurred by the Buyer, or for the benefit of, the Buyer in connection with
providing such indemnification up to such amount received by the Seller
Indemnitee less any expenses of recovery, deductibles and/or co-payments; and

  

  

(iv) The Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees only for
those claims giving rise to Seller Damages as to which the Seller Indemnitees
have given the Buyer written notice thereof prior to the end of the applicable
Survival Period. Any written notice delivered by a Seller Indemnitee to the
Buyer with respect to Seller Damages shall set forth with as much specificity
as is reasonably practicable the basis of the claim for Seller Damages and, to
the extent reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount of such
claim.

  

  

7.4 Third-Party Indemnification. The obligations of the Seller to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees under Section 7.2 with respect to Buyer Damages and the
obligations of the Buyer to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees under Section 7.3
with respect to Seller Damages, in either case resulting from the assertion of
liability by third parties (each, as the case may be, a "Claim"), shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:

  

  

(a) Any party against whom any Claim is asserted shall give the indemnifying
party written notice of any such Claim promptly after learning of such Claim,
and the indemnifying party may, at its option, undertake the defense of such
Claim by representatives of its own choosing. Failure to give prompt notice of
a Claim under this Agreement shall not affect the indemnifying party's
obligations under this Article 7, except to the extent the indemnifying party
is materially prejudiced by such failure to give prompt notice. If the
indemnifying party, within 30 days after notice of any such Claim, or such
shorter period as is reasonably required, fails to assume the defense of such
Claim, the Buyer Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be,
against whom such Claim has been made shall (upon further notice to the
indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk, and at the
expense, of the indemnifying party, subject to the right of the indemnifying
party to assume the defense of such Claim at any time prior to settlement,
compromise or final determination of such Claim;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Anything in this Section 7.4 to the contrary notwithstanding, the
indemnifying party shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any
action, suit or proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment (i) that
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant
or plaintiff to the Seller Indemnitee or the Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may
be, of a written release from all liability in respect of such action, suit or
proceeding or (ii) for other than monetary damages to be borne by the
indemnifying party, without the prior written consent of the Seller Indemnitee
or the Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may be, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The indemnified party shall not enter into any
settlement or compromise of any action, suit or proceeding or consent to the
entry of any judgment; and

  

  

(c) The indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall cooperate fully in
all aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial,
compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect of which indemnity
is sought under this Article 7, including by providing the other party with
reasonable access to employees and officers (including as witnesses) and other
information.

  

  

7.5 No Setoff. Neither the Buyer nor the Seller shall have any right to setoff
any Buyer Damages or Seller Damages, respectively, against any payments to be
made by either of them under this Agreement.

  

  

7.6 Insurance. The indemnifying party shall be subrogated to the rights of any
indemnified party in respect of any insurance relating to Buyer Damages or
Seller Damages, as the case may be, to the extent of any indemnification
payments made under this Agreement, and the indemnified party shall provide
all reasonably requested assistance to the indemnifying party in respect of
such subrogation.

  

  

7.7 No Duplication. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be determined to avoid duplication of recovery by reason of the state of
facts (i) giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or (ii) taken into account in
determining any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Sections 1.10(d) and
4.14.

  

  

7.8 Sole Remedy.

  

  

(a) The parties agree that, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy of any party to this Agreement, any Buyer Indemnitee or any Seller
Indemnitee or their respective Affiliates with respect to this Agreement or
any other claims relating to the events giving rise to this Agreement and the
transactions provided for in this Agreement or contemplated by this Agreement
shall be limited to the indemnification provisions set forth in Sections 4.8,
4.12, 4.13, 6.1(b), 8.8 and this Article 7 and, in furtherance of the
foregoing, each of the parties, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, waives
and releases the other party to this Agreement (and such other party's
Affiliates) from, to the fullest extent permitted under any applicable Law,
any and all rights, claims and causes of action it or its Affiliates may have
against the other party to this Agreement with respect to the foregoing
matters, except as provided by this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The parties intend that, even though indemnification and other obligations
appear in various sections and articles of this Agreement, the indemnification
procedures and limitations contained in this Article 7 shall apply to all
indemnity and other obligations of the parties under this Agreement, except as
provided in Sections 4.8, 4.12, 4.13, 6.1(b) and 8.8 and except to the extent
expressly excluded in this Article 7.

  

  

7.9 No Special Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE UNDER THIS
ARTICLE 7 OR OTHERWISE IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL,
PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, REMOTE, SPECULATIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT THAT SUCH DAMAGES ARISE FROM A THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

  

  

7.10 Express Negligence. THE FOREGOING INDEMNITIES ARE INTENDED TO BE
ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPRESS TERMS AND SCOPE
THEREOF NOTWITHSTANDING ANY EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE OR ANY SIMILAR DIRECTIVE
THAT WOULD PROHIBIT OR OTHERWISE LIMIT INDEMNITIES BECAUSE OF THE NEGLIGENCE
(WHETHER SOLE, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT
LIABILITY OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.

  

  

7.11 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Each of the Seller and the Buyer
agrees to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Laws.

  

  

ARTICLE 8

  

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  

8.1 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented at any time by the parties to this Agreement, under an instrument
in writing signed by all parties.

  

  

8.2 Entire Agreement; Assignment; Binding Effect. This Agreement (including
the Seller Disclosure Letter and the Buyer Disclosure Letter), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the documents listed in Sections 1.5 and 1.6
actually delivered at Closing constitute the entire agreement between the
parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede other
prior agreements, understandings, covenants and representations, both written
and oral, between the parties to the extent they relate in any way to the
subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
unless otherwise herein set forth, shall not be assigned, by operation of Law
or otherwise, by a party, without the prior written consent of the other
party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns. No representation, covenant, warranty,
promise, inducement or statement of intention has been made by either party
hereto that is not embodied in this Agreement or such other documents, and
neither party hereto shall be bound by, or be liable for, any alleged
representation, warranty, promise, inducement or statement of intention not
embodied herein or therein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

8.3 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision
of this Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other terms or provisions of this Agreement
or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction, and the remaining terms and
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent
permitted by law, unless doing so would result in an interpretation of this
Agreement that is manifestly unjust.

  

  

8.4 Notices. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all notices and
other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and may be given
by any of the following methods: (a) personal delivery; (b) facsimile
transmission; (c) registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return
receipt requested; or (d) overnight delivery service. Such notices and
communications shall be sent to the appropriate party at its address or
facsimile number given below or at such other address or facsimile number for
such party as shall be specified by notice given under this Agreement (and
shall be deemed given upon receipt by such party or upon actual delivery to
the appropriate address, or, in case of a facsimile transmission, upon
transmission by the sender and issuance by the transmitting machine of a
confirmation slip that the number of pages constituting the notice have been
transmitted without error; in the case of notices sent by facsimile
transmission, the sender shall contemporaneously give a copy of the notice to
the addressee at the address provided for below using one of the other
delivery methods set forth above; provided, however, that such copy shall in
no way alter the time at which the facsimile notice is deemed received):

8.5 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Texas applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that state. All actions and proceedings arising out
of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined in any Texas
state or federal court sitting in Houston, Texas, and the parties hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such
action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. Each party
irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such action
or proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process to such party at its
address specified in Section 8.4. The parties agree that a final, non-
appealable judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Nothing in this Section 8.5 shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. The
consents to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 8.5 shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Texas and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section 8.5 and shall not be
deemed to confer rights on any person other than the parties.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D)
IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.5(b).

  

  

8.6 Descriptive Headings; References. The descriptive headings used in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way
be construed to define, limit, describe, explain, modify, amplify, or add to
the interpretation, construction or meaning of any provision of, or scope or
intent of, this Agreement nor in any way affect this Agreement. When reference
is made in this Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

  

  

8.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but any of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. An executed counterpart signature page to this
Agreement delivered by fax or other means of electronic transmission shall be
deemed to be an original and shall be as effective for all purposes as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart.

  

  

8.8 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses (including legal and financial advisory fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with, or in anticipation of, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses; provided, however, the Buyer shall pay all
fees relating to any filing made pursuant to any Antitrust Regulations. The
Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, shall indemnify and
hold harmless the other party from and against any and all claims or
liabilities for financial advisory and finders' fees incurred by reason of any
action taken by such party or otherwise arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any person claiming to have been engaged by
such party or parties.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

8.9 Interpretation. The phrase "to the knowledge of the Seller" or any similar
phrase shall mean such facts and other information that as of the date of this
Agreement are actually known to any director or executive officer of the
Seller, after due inquiry. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

  

  

8.10 Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of
the Seller, its successors and permitted assigns and the Seller Indemnitees,
with respect to the obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement, and for the
benefit of the Buyer, its successors and permitted assigns and the Buyer
Indemnitees, with respect to the obligations of the Seller under this
Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to
any other third party any remedy, claim of liability or reimbursement, cause
of action or other right. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations between the parties and are for the sole
benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of knowledge of either of
the parties. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  

  

8.11 No Waivers. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no
failure to exercise, delay in exercising, or single or partial exercise of any
right, power or remedy by any party, and no course of dealing between the
parties, shall constitute a waiver of any such right, power or remedy. No
waiver by a party of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or
covenant under this Agreement, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant under this Agreement or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any such prior or subsequent occurrence. No waiver shall
be valid unless in writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is
sought to be enforced.

  

  

8.12 Specific Performance. The parties agree that if any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at
law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this
Agreement and immediate injunctive relief, without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy
at Law or in equity.

  

  

8.13 Buyer Parent Guarantor Undertaking. Buyer Parent Guarantor, a corporation
which is registered pursuant to the laws of Alberta, Canada, and which is the
direct or indirect owner of all the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Buyer, hereby agrees to cause the Buyer to perform the actions required of it
under this Agreement and absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the payment
of all sums due hereunder and the performance of all of the Buyer's duties
described herein.
