ARTICLE 2 
 The Merger 

   

Section 2.01 _. The Merger._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the
"Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law,
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the
Company shall be the surviving corporation (with respect to all post-Closing
periods, the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

(b) The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall
take place at a time and date to be specified by the parties which will be no
later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article 9
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing) or at such other time as the parties hereto agree in writing.
The Closing shall take place at such location as the parties hereto agree in
writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the
"Closing Date." 

  

(c) On the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Delaware 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by
Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly
filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be
specified in the certificate of merger). 

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of
the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company
and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law. 

  

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, 

   

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.04, each
share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive $35.25 in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"); 

  

(b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and 

  

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

Section 2.03. _Surrender And Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an agent reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated
Shares"). Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation or another
Affiliate of Parent to deposit, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares, cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.02(a). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent
and which shall be in customary form and contain customary provisions) for
use in such exchange. 

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, 

 

    ##### 

  

  

upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal or (ii) receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the
Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. 

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and the Person requesting such payment shall either (i) pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or (ii) establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article 2. 

  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares
of Company Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or another Affiliate of Parent, upon
demand, and any holder of shares of Company Stock who has not exchanged shares
of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor any Affiliate of
Parent (including the Surviving Corporation) shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective
Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority)
shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of
Parent (or the Surviving Corporation or another Affiliate of Parent to whom
the unclaimed Merger Consideration is returned pursuant to this Section
2.03(e)) free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other
dispositions of equity securities of the Company in connection with this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company, to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act. 

  

Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted such shares of Company
Stock in favor of the Merger and who has demanded appraisal for such shares
of Company Stock in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal. If, after
the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the
right to appraisal, such shares of Company Stock shall be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Stock, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands. 

  

Section 2.05. _Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_. (a) At the
Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Stock outstanding
under any Employee Plan (each, a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not
vested or exercisable, shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price of such Company
Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option (whether or not vested or exercisable);
and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) pay such amount promptly after the Effective Time
to the holder of each such Company Stock Option. 

  

(b) Not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such actions as may be required to cause each restricted stock award
and each deferred stock award granted under the Companys 2003 Amended and
Restated Equity and Performance Incentive Plan and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time (each, a "Restricted Stock Award") to fully vest as
of the Effective Time and such Restricted Stock Award shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the same
manner as shares of Company Stock under Section 2.02(a). 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any written consents from holders of Company Stock Options
and Restricted Stock Awards, to the extent necessary pursuant to the terms of
any Employee Plan and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of 

 

    ##### 

  

  

any Employee Plan that, in the case of either clauses (i) or (ii), are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 2.05. 

  

Section 2.06. _Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding any change that results from any exercise
of Company Stock Options or vesting of deferred stock awards outstanding as
of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. 

  

Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights._ Subject to Section 6.04(c), each of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent and any other relevant Affiliate of Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any Applicable Law relating to the payment of Taxes. To the extent the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent, as the case may be,
so withholds amounts and pays such amounts over to the applicable Taxing
Authorities, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock in respect of
which the Surviving Corporation, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding. 

  

Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Article 2. 

  

ARTICLE 3 

  

The Surviving Corporation

    

Section 3.01. _Certificate of Incorporation._ The certificate of incorporation
of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
Applicable Law. 

  

Section 3.02. _Bylaws._ The bylaws of the Company in effect at the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with Applicable Law. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 3.03. _Directors and Officers._ From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective
Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers
of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation. 

  

ARTICLE 4 

  

Representations and Warranties of the Company

    

Subject to Section 11.05, except as disclosed or identified in the Company
10-K or any of the Companys quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current
reports on Form 8-K filed since August 31, 2006 (collectively, the "Company
Current SEC Documents") or as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule,
the Company represents and warrants to Parent that: 

  

Section 4.01. _Corporate Existence and Power._ The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers, authority and capacity,
and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and
approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted, except
for those licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign or extra-provincial corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent
true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company as currently in effect. 

  

Section 4.02. _Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Companys
stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement is the only vote of
the holders of any class of the Companys capital stock necessary to adopt
this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company
Stockholder Approval"). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary,
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, 

 

    ##### 

  

  

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors rights generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law). 

  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys Board of Directors
adopted resolutions (i) determining that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, (ii) approving this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) recommending (subject to Section
8.06) the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders (such
recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation"). 

  

Section 4.03. _Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger, as provided in Section 2.01, (ii)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and of the
Competition Act, (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the
1933 Act, the 1934 Act, and any other applicable U.S. state or federal
securities laws, (iv) compliance with any applicable requirements of the ICA,
(v) compliance with the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act, N.J.S.A.
13:1k-6, et seq. ("Industrial Site Recovery Act"), if applicable, (vi)
compliance with the Connecticut Transfer Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. §22a-134, et
seq. ("Connecticut Transfer Act"), if applicable, (vii) any filings required
by the United States Surface Transportation Board or (viii) any actions or
filings the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

Section 4.04. _Non-contravention._ The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) require any
consent or other action by any person under, constitute a default, or an
event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute
a default, under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any agreement or other
instrument legally binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar
authorization applicable to the assets or business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions,
in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would not 

 

    ##### 

  

  

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. 

  

Section 4.05. _Capitalization._ (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of (i) 500,000,000 shares designated as Company Stock and
(ii) 50,000,000 shares designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). As of February 1,
2007, there were outstanding 79,373,714 shares of Company Stock and no shares
of Preferred Stock. As of February 1, 2007, there were outstanding 75,939
restricted stock awards and 714,380 deferred stock awards. As of February 1,
2007, there were outstanding Company Stock Options to purchase an aggregate
of 1,598,836 shares of Company Stock (of which options to purchase an
aggregate of 790,584 shares of Company Stock were exercisable). All
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been, and all shares
that may be issued upon exercise of Company Stock Options will be, when
issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. No Subsidiary or
Affiliate of the Company owns any shares of capital stock of the Company.
Section 4.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
correct list of each outstanding employee stock option to purchase shares of
Company Stock, including the holder, date of grant, exercise price, vesting
schedule and number of shares of Company Stock subject thereto as of the date
hereof. 

  

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for changes since February 1,
2007 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding on such
date, there are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or voting
securities of the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company
or (iii) options or other rights to acquire from the Company, or other
obligation of the Company to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting
securities of the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii)
being referred to collectively as the "Company Securities"). There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities. 

  

Section 4.06. _Subsidiaries._ (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company has been duly
organized, and is validly existing and in good standing (where applicable)
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, as the case
may be, and has all requisite powers, authority and capacity, except where
the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have
such powers, authority and capacity would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and has
all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually and in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
(where applicable) in each jurisdiction where such qualification is
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All material Subsidiaries of the Company and
their respective jurisdictions of organization are identified in Section
4.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

(b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting securities or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company, is owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any
other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other voting
securities or ownership interests). There are no outstanding (i) securities
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests
in any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) options or other rights to
acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligation of

Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of

requirements of the Securities Laws.

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company Public Disclosure
Document did not, and each such Company Public Disclosure Document filed

(d) Each Company Public Disclosure Document that is a registration statement,
as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as

statements therein not misleading. 

  

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and

reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company required under
the 1934 Act with respect to such reports. Each Company Public Disclosure
Document that was required to be accompanied by such certification was
accompanied by such certification and, at the time of filing or submission
of each such certification, such certification was true and accurate and
complied with the applicable Securities Laws in all material respects.

the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any action taken by

Section 4.12. _Compliance with Laws and Court Orders_. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is and, since August 31, 2003, has been, in compliance with,
and to the knowledge of the Company is not under investigation with respect
to, and has not been threatened in writing to be charged with, or given
notice of any violation of, any Applicable Law, except for failures to comply

in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

Section 4.13. _Litigation._ There is no claim, action, suit, investigation,
audit or proceeding, including any appeal or application for review, pending 

 

    #####

such failures which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Permits are in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that (with or without notice or lapse of time) may
constitute or result in a violation of any such Permit, or give rise to an
obligation on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake
or bear any cost of remedial action, except for such events or circumstances
which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

Section 4.15. _Finders  Fees. _Except for Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated,
a copy of whose engagement agreement has been provided to Parent, there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been
retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Company or any of its

Section 4.18. _Employee Benefit Plans._ (a) Section 4.18(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list identifying each
material "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, each
material employment, severance or similar contract, plan, arrangement or
policy and each other material plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing
for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock
related rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation
benefits, insurance (including any self-insured arrangements), health or
medical benefits, employee assistance program, disability or sick
leave benefits, workers compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits,
severance benefits and post-employment or retirement benefits (including
compensation, pension, health, medical or life insurance benefits) which is
maintained, administered or contributed to by the Company or any Subsidiary
and covers any current or former United States employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability. Copies of such plans (and, if applicable,
related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies) and all amendments
thereto and written interpretations thereof have been furnished to Parent
together with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if
applicable, Schedule B thereto) and prepared in connection with any such plan
or trust. Such plans are referred to collectively herein as the "Employee
Plans." For greater certainty, an International Plan is not an Employee
Plan. 

  

(b) (i) As of the most recent valuation date as set forth in a written
valuation report provided to Parent (each such date, a "Valuation Date"), the
fair market value of the assets of each Employee Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA (other than a "multiemployer plan," as defined below) (a "Title IV
Plan") 

  

    ##### 

  

  

(excluding for these purposes any accrued but unpaid contributions) was not
less than the present value of all benefits accrued under such Title IV Plan
using the assumptions set forth in Note 7 to the Companys Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in the Company 10-K, (ii) as of the relevant
Valuation Date, no "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in Section 412
of the Code, has been incurred with respect to any Employee Plan subject to
such Section 412, whether or not waived, (iii) as of the date hereof, no
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, other than a
"reportable event" that will not have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
has occurred in connection with any Employee Plan and (iv) as of the date
hereof, no event described in Section 4062 or 4063 of ERISA, has occurred in
connection with any Employee Plan. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate of the Company has (x) engaged in, or is a successor or
parent corporation to an entity that has engaged in, a transaction described
in Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA or (y) incurred, or reasonably expects
to incur prior to the Effective Time, (A) any liability under Title IV of
ERISA arising in connection with the termination of, or a complete or partial
withdrawal from, any plan covered or previously covered by Title IV of ERISA
or (B) any liability under Section 4971 of the Code that in either case could
become a liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time. 

  

(c) No transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan which is covered by Title
I of ERISA, which transaction has or will cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to incur any material liability under ERISA, the Code or
otherwise, excluding transactions effected pursuant to and in compliance with
a statutory or administrative exemption. No condition exists as of the date
hereof that (i) could constitute grounds for termination by the PBGC of any
employee benefit plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA that is maintained
by the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates or (ii) presents a
material risk of complete or partial withdrawal from any "Multiemployer
Plan", as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, which could result in the
Company or any Subsidiary incurring a withdrawal liability within the meaning
of Section 4201 of ERISA. The assets of the Company and all of its
Subsidiaries are not now subject to any lien imposed under Code Section
412(n) by reason of a failure of any of the Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate to make timely installments or other payments required under Code
Section 412\. If a "complete withdrawal" by the Company and all of its ERISA
Affiliates were to occur as of the Closing Date with respect to all
Multiemployer Plans, none of the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their
ERISA Affiliates would incur any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA
that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

(d) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or has pending or
has time remaining in which to file, an application for such determination
from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware 

 

    ##### 

  

  

of any reason why any such determination letter should be revoked or not be
reissued. The Company has made available to Parent copies of the most recent
Internal Revenue Service determination letters with respect to each such
Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan has been maintained in material compliance
with its terms and Applicable Law. No material events have occurred with
respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or assessment by or
against the Company of any material excise taxes under the Code. 

  

(e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (either alone or together with any other event) entitle any employee or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance
pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any Employee Plan. There is no contract, plan or arrangement
(written or otherwise) covering any employee or former employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively,
would entitle any employee or former employee to any severance or other
payment solely as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby, or could
give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant
to the terms of Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code. The Company has
provided or otherwise made available to Parent forms of the material
agreements, arrangements and other instruments which give rise to an
obligation to make or set aside amounts payable to or on behalf of the
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether as termination pay,
severance pay or otherwise) as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and/or any subsequent employment termination (whether by the
Company or the officer). 

  

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in
respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries
except as required under Section 4980B of the Code or pursuant to which
premiums are fully paid by such employee. 

  

(g) Section 4.18(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
each material collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement with
any union or labor organization. Furthermore: (i) to the knowledge of the
Company, there are no material unfair labor practice charges or complaints
against the Company or any of its subsidiaries pending before the
National Labor Relations Board or any foreign equivalent; (ii) there are no
material labor strikes, slowdowns or stoppages actually pending or threatened
against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no material representation claims or
petitions pending before the National Labor Relations Board or any foreign
equivalent and there are no questions concerning representation with respect
to the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries; and (iv) there are no
material grievance or pending arbitration 

 

    ##### 

  

  

proceedings against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that arose out of
or under any collective bargaining agreement. 

  

(h) Section 4.18(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and
complete list identifying each material International Plan. The Company has
provided Parent with current and complete copies of each material
International Plan (and, if applicable, related trust or funding agreements
or insurance policies), all amendments thereto and written summaries or
interpretations thereof and the most recent plan financial statements and
actuarial reports, as applicable, for each International Plan. Each
International Plan has been established, registered, maintained, amended,
funded, administered and invested in material compliance with its terms
(including the terms of any documents in respect of such International Plan),
all Applicable Laws and the collective agreements, as applicable, and each
International Plan has been maintained in good standing with applicable
Governmental Authorities. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
a formal plan or has made an announcement, promise or commitment (written or
oral) to create any additional International Plan or to improve, enhance or
change the benefits provided under any International Plan. 

  

(i) Each International Plan that is a registered pension plan has been funded
in accordance with the most recently filed actuarial valuation therefor. 

  

(j) There is no material investigation by a Governmental Authority or material
action, suit, proceeding or claim (other than routine claim claims for
payment of benefits) pending against or involving or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against or involving, any International Plan. 

  

(k) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (either alone or together with any other event) entitle any employee or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance
pay or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any International Plan. 

  

(l) All employer and employee payments, contributions and premiums required to
be remitted, paid to or in respect of each International Plan have been paid
or remitted in a timely fashion in accordance with its terms and all
Applicable Laws. 

  

(m) To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred respecting any
registered International Plan which would entitle any Person (without the
consent of the Company) to wind-up or terminate any International Plan, in
whole or in part. Where any International Plan which is a registered pension
plan has been partially or fully wound-up or terminated, all assets,
including any surplus, attributable to such partial or full wind-up or
termination 

 

    ##### 

  

  

have been fully distributed in accordance with all Applicable Laws or where
such distribution of assets is pending, the amount of the surplus attributable
to such partial or full wind-up or termination together with the date as of
which such amount is determined is disclosed in Section 4.18(m) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

(n) There is no entity other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
participating in any International Plan. 

  

(o) All employee data necessary to administer each International Plan is in
the possession of the Company or its agents and is in a form which is
sufficient for the proper administration of the International Plan in
accordance with its terms and all Applicable Laws and such data is
complete and correct in all material respects. 

  

(p) None of the International Plans provide benefits beyond retirement or
other termination of service to employees or former employees or to the
beneficiaries or dependants of such employees. 

  

(q) In the past two years (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has effectuated a "plant closing" (as defined in the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN Act") affecting any site of employment
or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment or
facility of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) there has not
occurred a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of
employment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect: 

   

(i) since August 31, 2003 (and prior to August 31, 2003 if not fully
resolved pursuant to all Environmental Laws and all relevant Governmental
Authorities with no known outstanding commitment, liability or obligation),
no notice, notification, demand, request for information, citation, summons
or order has been received, no complaint has been filed, no penalty has been
assessed, and no claim, action, suit, investigation, audit, review or
proceeding (or any basis therefor), including any appeal or application
for review, is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened by
any Governmental Authority or other Person against or relating to the Company
or any Subsidiary and relating to or arising out of any Environmental Law; 

   

(ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries are and have been, since August 31,

arising under or relating to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances, the

incorporation and has all corporate powers, authority and capacity, and all

Section 5.04. _Non-contravention._ The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will

cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled
under any agreement or other instrument legally binding upon Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or
other similar authorization applicable to the assets or business of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of

Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

  

Section 5.05. _Disclosure Documents_. None of the information provided or to
be provided, or confirmed or to be confirmed, in writing by Parent (excluding
any information provided that is predictive or forward-looking in nature)
specifically for inclusion in the Company Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto, at the time the Company Proxy Statement or any amendment
or supplement thereto is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at
the time such stockholders vote on adoption of this Agreement, will be in
accordance with the facts and will not omit anything likely to affect the
import of such information. 

  

Section 5.06. _Finders  Fees. _There is no investment banker, broker, finder
or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any fee or commission from the
Company or any of its Affiliates upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

Section 5.07. _Financing._ As of the date hereof, Parent has executed facility
agreements from financial institutions to provide funds, together with 

 

    ##### 

  

  

available cash, sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and
related fees and expenses at the Closing. Parent has provided to the Company
copies (with certain information redacted) of all facility agreements and
other material documentation provided by financial institutions as of the
date of this Agreement in regard to the commitments to provide financing
for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Company acknowledges that such financing agreements are provided
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement and are "Confidential Information"
for purposes thereof. The facility agreements are not subject to any
conditions other than as set forth therein, are in full force and effect and
have not been withdrawn. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no fact or
occurrence existing that would reasonably be expected to make any of the
stated assumptions or conditions or any of the other statements set forth in
the facility agreements materially inaccurate. As of the date of
this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy any of the conditions to the facility agreements or that the funds
for the facility agreements will not be available on a timely basis for the
transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure
of Parent to obtain the financing referenced above, including due to the
failure to satisfy any condition to funding, is not a condition to this
Agreement.

business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement. 

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent may purchase a prepaid directors and
officers liability "tail" insurance policy covering a period of six years
following the Effective Time in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time and covering those persons who are currently covered by
(and providing coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that
are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured than) the policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and in existence on the date of this
Agreement and previously made available to Parent. If Parent does not so
purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, then Parent shall
cause to be maintained by the Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) for a period of six years after the
Effective Time the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and in
existence on the date of this Agreement and made available to Parent (
_provided_ that the Surviving Corporation (or any such successor) may
substitute therefor one or more policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that, in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.01(c), the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annually in the aggregate in excess
of 200% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year,
which amount is set forth in 

  

    ##### 

  

   

Section 7.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and _provided further_
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. In order to facilitate
the resolution of any claim that may be made against an Indemnified Person,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) give to such Indemnified
Person, its authorized representatives and the representatives of the carrier
of the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
(the "DandO Carrier") reasonable access during normal business hours to its
offices, properties, books and records, (ii) furnish to such Indemnified
Person, its authorized representatives and the DandO Carrier such information
as such Persons may reasonably request, and (iii) instruct its employees,
counsel, and other authorized representatives to otherwise cooperate with
such Indemnified Person and the DandO Carrier to resolve such claim 

  

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.01. 

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.01 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. 

  

Section 7.02. _Employee Matters._ (a) Subject to Applicable Law, until the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to provide to the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employees thereof as of
the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") compensation (other than equity-
based compensation) and benefit plans substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to the Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that this sentence of Section 7.02(a) shall not
apply to any employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement listed
in Section 4.18(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent shall and shall
cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to comply with
all of the Companys obligations under all collective bargaining agreement
listed in Section 4.18(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and all
employment, severance and other similar individual agreements listed in
Section 4.18(a) of the Company 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Disclosure Schedule pursuant to the terms of such agreements as of the date
hereof. 

  

(b) Each Company Employee will receive service credit for all periods of
employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor
thereof prior to the Effective Time for purposes of vesting and eligibility
under any employee benefit plan in which such employee participates after the
Effective Time, to the extent that such service was recognized under
any analogous plan of such Company or Subsidiary in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that no such service credit shall be given
for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension or retiree
healthcare plans where such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits. 

  

(c) If on or after the Effective Time, any Company Employee becomes covered
under any benefit plan providing medical, dental, health, pharmaceutical or
vision benefits (a "Successor Plan"), other than the Employee Plan or
International Plan in which he or she participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, any such Successor Plan shall not include any restrictions
or limitations with respect to any pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements (except to the extent such exclusions or
requirements were applicable under the corresponding Employee Plan or
International Plan), and any eligible expenses incurred by such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the calendar year in which
the Company Employee becomes covered under any Successor Plan shall be taken
into account under any such Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and/or his or her covered dependents for that year, to the
extent that such expenses were incurred during a period in which the Company
Employee or covered dependent was covered under a corresponding Employee Plan
or International Plan. 

  

(d) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Parent, its
Affiliates, the Company or its Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any
specific person or, except as otherwise specifically set forth above, to
continue any specific Employee Plan. No Company Employee shall have any third
party beneficiary rights under, or rights to any specific levels
of compensation or benefits as a result of the application of this Section
7.02.

Form pursuant to the HSR Act and shall make such filings as may be required

provide the other party such assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement or
the Parent Shareholder Circular, as the case may be, including the provision

Section 8.06. _No Solicitation; Other Offers._ (a) Neither the Company or
Parent (each, a "Section 8.06 Party") or any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall, nor shall a Section 8.06 Party or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or
permit any of 

 

    ##### 

  

  

its or their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly
facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish
any information relating to such Section 8.06 Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of such Section 8.06 Party or any of its Subsidiaries to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Third Party that is seeking to
make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) grant any waiver or release
under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of such Section 8.06 Party or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) fail
to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the other Section 8.06
Party the approval or recommendation of such Section 8.06 Partys Board of
Directors (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or take any action or make
any statement inconsistent with the approval or recommendation of the Merger)
(any of the foregoing in this clause (iv), a "Change in Recommendation") or
(v) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet
or other similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of a Section 8.06
Party, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, may (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Third
Party that, subject to the Section 8.06 Partys compliance with
Section 8.06(a), has made a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal that the Board
of Directors of such Section 8.06 Party reasonably determines is or will lead
to a Superior Proposal and (ii) thereafter furnish to such Third Party
nonpublic information relating to such Section 8.06 Party or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms not less
restrictive to such Third Party than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement dated December 18, 2006 between the Company and Parent (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") (a copy of which shall be provided
for informational purposes only to the other Section 8.06 Party). Nothing
contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of a Section 8.06 Party
from (x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act or (y) making any disclosure to its
stockholders and/or the public required by Applicable Law. 

  

"Superior Proposal" means any _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock
of a Section 8.06 Party on terms that the Board of Directors of such Section
8.06 Party determines in good faith by a majority vote, after considering the
advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and taking
into account all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,
including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions
to consummation, would be (i) more favorable and provide greater value to the
stockholders of such Section 8.06 Party than the Merger (as proposed to be
amended by the other Section 8.06 Party) and (ii) reasonably capable of
being 

 

    ##### 

  

  

consummated on the terms and conditions so proposed, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and for which
financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully
committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board of Directors
of such Section 8.06 Party. 

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Section 8.06
Partys Board of Directors may make a Change in Recommendation, if based
solely on events or developments, unknown to such Board of Directors as of
the date hereof, which occur, or become known to such Board of Directors,
after the date hereof but prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting (in the
case of the Company) or the Parent Shareholder Meeting (in the case of
Parent) if it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably expected to
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Each Section
8.06 Party confirms that the Board of Directors of that Section 8.06 Party is
not, as of the date of this Agreement, aware of any information or expected
events or developments which would cause the Board of Directors of that
Section 8.06 Party to make a Change in Recommendation. In considering all
factors relevant to the Board of Directors of the Parent in making the Parent
Board Recommendation, Parent confirms that the Board of Directors of Parent
has taken into account all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including Section 8.02) and all of the terms and conditions of Parents
financing facilities referred to in Section 5.07. The parties further
agree that irrespective of whether a Section 8.06 Partys Board of Directors
has effected a Change in Recommendation, until the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms (i) in no event shall such Section
8.06 Party make any SEC, FCC, United States Surface Transportation Board or
other regulatory filing (including any antitrust, competition, communications
or transportation law filing) in connection with an Acquisition Proposal and
(ii) such Section 8.06 Party shall otherwise remain subject to all of its
obligations under this Agreement (including its obligations pursuant to
Section 8.02, Section 8.04, Section 8.05 and this Section 8.06). 

  

(d) The Board of Directors of a Section 8.06 Party shall not take any of the
actions referred to in Section 8.06(b) or 8.06(c) unless such Section 8.06
Party shall have delivered to the other Section 8.06 Party a prior written
notice advising the other Section 8.06 Party that it intends to take such
action. In addition, each Section 8.06 Party shall notify the other Section
8.06 Party promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by
such Section 8.06 Party (or any of its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal,
any indication that a Third Party is considering making an Acquisition
Proposal or of any request for information relating to such Section 8.06 Party
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of such Section 8.06 Party or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Third Party that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. Such Section 8.06 Party shall provide such notice orally and
in writing and shall identify the Third Party 

  

    ##### 

  

   

making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request. Such Section 8.06 Party shall promptly keep the other
Section 8.06 Party informed of the status and details of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request. Further, the Board of Directors of a Section
8.06 Party shall not make a Change in Recommendation in response to
an Acquisition Proposal unless (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (ii) such Section 8.06 Party promptly notifies the other
Section 8.06 Party, in writing at least three Business Days before taking
that action, of its intention to do so, attaching the most current version of
any proposed agreement or a detailed summary of all material terms of such
Superior Proposal and the identity of the offeror, and (iii) the other
Section 8.06 Party does not make, within three Business Days after its
receipt of that written notification, an offer that is at least as favorable
to the stockholders of such Section 8.06 Party as such Superior Proposal. 

  

(e) Each Section 8.06 Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
advisors, employees and other agents of such Section 8.06 Party and any of
its Subsidiaries to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third
Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third
Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information
about such Section 8.06 Party that was furnished by or on behalf of such
Section 8.06 Party to return or destroy all such information. 

  

Section 8.07. _Public Announcements._ To the extent reasonably practicable,
each of the Company and Parent shall consult with the other party before,
directly or through any representatives, issuing any press release, having
any communication with the press (whether or not for attribution), making any
other public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call
with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable
Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange
or association, shall not, to the extent reasonably practicable, issue any
such press release, have any such communication, make any such other
public statement or schedule any such press conference or conference call
before such consultation. 

  

Section 8.08. _Further Assurances._ At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 8.09. _United Kingdom._ Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that an original, executed copy of this
Agreement is not brought into the United Kingdom.

to a reasonable person who has read that information concurrently with such
representations and warranties, _provided_ that in no event shall any
information contained in any part of any Company Current SEC Document

hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of

Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
