Escrow Holder in an interest bearing bank account for the benefit of the
Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Additional Deposit. On the Contingency Expiration Date, if
Purchaser has notified Seller that it intends to proceed with this Agreement

Agreement as a result of an event or condition that does not constitute
Purchasers default under this Agreement) and shall be immediately released to
Seller without the need for any further instructions to Escrow Holder. The
term "Deposit" shall refer to the Initial Deposit and the Additional Deposit
and all interest earned thereon. If the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement is consummated, the Deposit shall be credited on Purchasers
account against the Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Balance of the Purchase Price. The balance of the Purchase

---|---|---

as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations thereunder. 
---|---|--- 


     | (e) | Termination. If Purchaser rejects the condition of the
Property and fails to notify Seller it is proceeding with this Agreement prior
to the Contingency Expiration Date, Escrow Holder shall return the portion of
the Deposit previously delivered to Escrow Holder to Purchaser, less one-half
of any escrow cancellation fees and neither party shall have any further
obligation under this Agreement other than Purchasers obligations under
Section 3. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, in the
event the purchase of the Property is not consummated for any reason other
than (i) a default under this Agreement by Seller or (ii) Purchasers
disapproval of the Property pursuant to __Section 3__ prior to the Contingency
Expiration Date; (iii) Purchasers termination of this Agreement pursuant to
__Sections 6(c)__ , __Section 11__ ,  _ _Section 15__ , or __Section 16__ ,
or (iv) failure of a condition in favor of Purchaser pursuant to __Section
8(b)__ , then the Deposit and all interest earned thereon shall be retained by
Seller and shall constitute liquidated damages of Seller. In the event this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 2(e) and the Deposit has been
released to Seller, Seller shall return the Deposit and all interest accrued
thereon to Purchaser within three (3) business days after Purchasers written
demand therefor.

---|--- 



     | (a) | Receipt of Contracts and Documents. Seller has made
available to Purchaser certain documents on the website established by

the extent such items are not on the website, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser or make available to Purchaser for review at the Hotel: (i) copies
of all Contracts that are post closing obligations that pertain to the
Property or any portion thereof and are listed on __Exhibit B__ , and (ii)
other documents reasonably requested by Purchaser to the extent such documents
pertain to the Property or any portion thereof and the business conducted
thereon or relating thereto, are in Sellers possession or control, are not
confidential, do not constitute Sellers trade secrets and are not subject to
attorney client privilege. All

Contracts that are assignable shall be assigned to Purchaser at the Close of
Escrow unless (i) the same can be terminated by Seller prior to the Close of
Escrow without cost to Seller; and (ii) such Contracts have been rejected by
Purchaser in writing prior to the Contingency Expiration Date. Purchasers
failure to terminate this Agreement prior to the Contingency Expiration Date
or reject any Contract prior to the Contingency Expiration Date shall be
deemed Purchasers acceptance of all Contracts and Purchaser shall have no
further right to disapprove any Contracts. If any Contract requires the other
partys consent to assignment and such other party disapproves the assignment
to Purchaser or does not permit Seller to be released from the obligations
under such Contract, the Purchaser shall pay all costs and expenses of
terminating the subject contract.



     | (b) | Review and Termination. Purchaser shall have until the
Contingency Expiration Date to review the materials provided by Seller and to
conduct such other due diligence, studies, tests, and inspections of the
Property (collectively, "Due Diligence Matters") as Purchaser deems
appropriate under the circumstances. Prior to the Contingency Expiration Date,
Purchaser may, in its sole and absolute discretion for any reason whatsoever,
terminate this Agreement, after which Seller and Purchaser shall not have any
further obligations pursuant to this Agreement except for those obligations
which are expressly provided to survive such termination.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Right of Entry. Prior to the Contingency Expiration Date,
Purchaser and its agents and contractors shall have the right, at Purchasers
sole cost and expense, to enter onto the Hotel, or any other portion of the
Real Property, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner upon prior
notice to the Seller for the purpose of making such tests, inspections,
surveys or other inquiries as Purchaser deems necessary or desirable in
connection with this Agreement. However, in no event shall Purchaser be
permitted to conduct any drilling or boring without the express written
consent of Seller. In conducting its due diligence, Purchaser is authorized to
contact directly any governmental authorities that may have jurisdiction over
the Property; provided that Purchaser gives Seller prior written notice of the
nature of the communication with the governmental agency and a reasonable
opportunity to participate in such communications or meetings. During such
inspection, Purchaser shall not unreasonably disturb any tenants or occupants
of the Hotel. In addition, as condition to any such entry, Purchaser shall
maintain liability insurance coverage applicable to such tests and
inspections with coverage in an amount equal to Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) per occurrence and provide Seller with certificates of such
insurance naming Seller as an additional insured prior to any entry, test or
inspection. After making any such tests and inspections, Purchaser shall
restore the Real Property to its condition prior to such tests and
inspections. Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller
harmless from any loss, damage, cost or expense (including without limitation
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Seller caused by Purchaser or its
agents or contractors in exercising its rights under this __Section 3(c)__.
This Indemnity shall survive the Close of Escrow or the termination of this
Agreement. If Purchaser fails to terminate this Agreement prior to the
Contingency Expiration Date, all Due Diligence Matters shall be deemed
approved by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any and
all contingencies with respect to such Due Diligence Matters, express or
implied, to its obligation to purchase the Property. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Confidentiality. Purchaser agrees to protect and safeguard,
and to instruct all other Qualified Persons (as defined below) to protect and
safeguard, all information delivered to Purchaser in connection with its
inspection and review of the Property ("Confidential Information") against
unauthorized use, publication or disclosure. Confidential Information that is
provided to Purchaser in written form will, at Sellers election, be
destroyed or returned to Seller immediately upon Sellers request. Purchaser
acknowledges that Seller shall be entitled to exercise any and all remedies,
in law or in equity, which Seller may have against Purchaser for a breach of
Purchasers obligations in this paragraph. Seller shall be entitled to recover
its attorneys fees reasonably incurred in connection with enforcement of its
rights hereunder. "Qualified Persons" shall mean employees, agents,
attorneys, accountants, lenders, investors or other consultants to whom it is
necessary to show the Confidential Information for the purposes of completing
Purchasers inspection and review. The provisions of this Section 3(d)
shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   4. | Title. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | PTR. Seller has made available to Purchaser and Purchaser
acknowledges receipt of a standard coverage preliminary title report or
commitment for the Property (the "PTR"), together with legible copies (to the
extent available) of all documents relating to the title exceptions referred
to in such PTR. As used herein, the term "Permitted Exceptions" shall mean
those exceptions to title of the Real Property as shown on the PTR, excluding
mortgage or deed of trust liens, mechanics liens and overdue tax liens and
assessments which shall be removed by Seller on or before the Closing. The
removal or elimination of any title exception reflected in the PTR shall be a

matter solely between Purchaser and Title Company, and after the Contingency
Expiration Date, Purchaser has no right to terminate or cancel this Agreement
or delay the Close of Escrow in order to obtain the title endorsements or
elimination of exceptions that Purchaser may desire. Without limiting the
generality of any other provision hereof, Purchaser agrees to take title to
the Land subject to all matters shown on the Survey (defined below) and all
laws, rules and regulations governing the use and development of the Land at
the Closing Date. Seller has obtained and delivered to Buyer an updated ALTA
Survey (" _Survey_ ") of the Property.



     | (b) | Title Policy. Upon the Closing, Purchasers title to the
Land, Appurtenances and Improvements shall be insured by an ALTA standard
coverage owners policy of title insurance paid by Seller showing title
vested in Purchaser as of the Closing Date, subject to the Permitted
Exceptions, and issued by the Title Company with aggregate liability in the
amount of the Purchase Price, with such endorsements as Purchaser may
reasonably request at Purchasers sole cost and expense (collectively, the
"Title Policy"). Purchaser may elect to obtain an ALTA extended coverage
owners policy, provided that Purchaser shall pay for the additional premium
associated with such extended coverage and that the issuance of such policy
shall not delay the Close of Escrow. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Purchaser in a manner customarily required by the Title Company for comparable
sellers of real property in order to issue the Title Policy or Purchasers
desires an extended coverage policy of title insurance. 
---|---|--- 



   5. | Closing. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Escrow. The parties have opened an escrow (the "Escrow")
with the Escrow Holder. This Agreement, together with such further
instructions, if any, as the parties shall provide to the Escrow Holder,
shall constitute the escrow instructions to the Escrow Holder. If the parties
give the Escrow Holder contradictory instructions, the Escrow Holder shall
have the right at its election to file an action in interpleader requiring
the parties to answer and litigate their several claims and rights among
themselves, and the Escrow Holder is authorized to deposit with the clerk of
court all documents and funds held in this Escrow. In the event such
action is filed, the parties agree to pay the Escrow Holders cancellation
charges and costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys fees that the Escrow
Holder is required to expend or incur in the interpleader action, the amount
thereof to be fixed and judgment therefor to be rendered by the court. Upon
the filing of such an action, the Escrow Holder shall thereupon be fully
released and discharged from all obligations to further perform any duties or
obligations otherwise imposed by the terms of Escrow. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Reportable Real Estate. The purchase and sale of the
Property is the sale of "reportable real estate" within the meaning of U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6045-4 (the "Regulations"). The Escrow Holder
is the "real estate reporting person" within the meaning of the Regulations
and shall make all reports to the federal government as required by the
Regulations.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Timing of Closing. The purchase and sale contemplated herein
shall close (the "Closing") on or before the Outside Closing Date. If the
Closing does not occur by the Outside Closing Date, this Agreement shall
terminate and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation
hereunder; except that, (i) Purchaser and Seller shall each be responsible for
one half of any escrow cancellation fee; (ii) Purchaser shall remain
obligated to observe the confidentiality provisions of Section 3(d); (iii) the
Deposit shall be delivered as provided elsewhere in this Agreement; and (iv)
nothing herein contained is intended to relieve either party of liability
arising as a result of a breach of this Agreement by such party. As used in
this Agreement, the "Closing", "Close of Escrow" or "Closing Date" means the
date and time that the Deed is recorded in the official recorders office of
the county in which the Property is located. Closing shall occur through the
Escrow with Escrow Holder in accordance with the general provisions of the
usual form of escrow agreement used by Escrow Holder in similar transactions
to the extent not inconsistent herewith (with such special provisions inserted
as may be required to conform to this Agreement). 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Closing Costs. Seller shall pay the premium for the Title
Policy up to the amount of the premium for an ALTA standard coverage owners
policy of title insurance covering the Land and Improvements, with aggregate
liability in the amount of the Purchase Price, any documentary transfer tax
due in connection with the consummation of this transaction, and fifty percent
(50%) of the escrow charges of Escrow Holder. Purchaser shall pay any bulk
sales tax, revenue tax, or excise tax (and any surtax thereon) due in
connection with the consummation of this transaction, the fees for recording
the Deed, the cost differential of the premium for the ALTA extended coverage
included in the Title Policy over the ALTA premium paid for by Seller, the
cost of any title endorsements, the cost of any lender title insurance
policies or endorsements, the cost of the Survey, and fifty percent (50%) of
all the charges of escrow charges of Escrow Holder. Each party shall bear the
expense of its own counsel and other consultants. Any closing cost not
allocated herein shall be borne in the manner that is customary in the county
in which the Property is located.

---|--- 



     | (a) | Terms of Management Agreement. The Parties shall negotiate
in good faith prior to the Contingency Expiration Date, the terms and
conditions and form of a management agreement (the "Management Agreement")
whereby Seller or its affiliate ("Manager") shall manage the Hotel for
Purchaser on terms agreed to by the parties. The form of Management Agreement

brand. The Franchise License Agreement shall be on the then most current form
of Franchise License Agreement as provided in the Uniform Franchise Offering
Circular ("UFOC") filed by Franchisor with such changes as the parties may

     | (c) | Release. Except as expressly set forth herein, Purchaser and
anyone claiming by, through or under Purchaser hereby waives its right to
recover from and fully and irrevocably releases Seller, its employees,
officers, directors, representatives, agents, servants, attorneys, affiliates,

corporations and organizations in its behalf ("Released Parties") from any
and all claims that it may now have or hereafter acquire against any of the
Released Parties for any costs, loss, liability, damage, expenses, demand,
action or cause of action arising from or related to any matters
affecting the Property, or any portion thereof. This release includes claims
of which Purchaser is presently unaware or which Purchaser does not presently
suspect to exist which, if known by Purchaser, would materially affect
Purchasers release to Seller. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Purchaser expressly waives any and all rights conferred upon it by
any statute or rule of law which provides that a release does not extend to
claims which the claimant does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at
the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
affected his settlement with the released party, including, without
limitation, any provisions similar to the following: "A general release does
not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in
his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must
have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."  
---|---|--- 



In this connection and to the extent permitted by law, Purchaser hereby
agrees, represents and warrants, which representation and warranty shall
survive the Close of Escrow and not be merged with the Closing, that Purchaser
realizes and acknowledges that factual matters now unknown to it may have
given or may hereafter give rise to causes of action, claims, demands, debts,
controversies, damages, costs, losses and expenses which are presently
unknown, unanticipated and unsuspected, and Purchaser further agrees,
represents and warrants, which representation and warranty shall survive the
Close of Escrow and not be merged with the Closing, that the waivers and
releases herein have been negotiated and agreed upon in light of that
realization and that Purchaser nevertheless hereby intends to release,
discharge and acquit Seller from any such unknown causes of action, claims,
demands, debts, controversies, damages, costs, losses and expenses which might
in any way be included as a material portion of the consideration given
to Seller by Purchaser in exchange for Sellers performance hereunder. The
foregoing release shall not apply to any of the matters expressly contained in
this Agreement.



Seller and Purchaser have each initialed this __Section 12(c)__ to further
indicate their awareness and acceptance of each and every provision hereof.

practice and shall not, without the prior written consent or other due
authorization or approval of Purchaser, make any modifications or alterations
to the Property other than in the ordinary course of business. Seller shall
not enter into any contracts with respect to the Property or any portion

Purchaser shall execute and file, at its sole cost and expense, all necessary
forms, applications and other documents (and Seller and Permittee shall
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in filing such forms, applications and
other documents) with the appropriate liquor and alcoholic beverage
authorities prior to the Closing so that such acquisition of the appropriate
liquor licenses shall take effect, if possible, prior to or upon completion of
Closing. If it is not possible to obtain the appropriate liquor licenses prior
to or upon completion of the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly execute all
forms, applications and other documents required to effect the acquisition of
such liquor licenses at the earliest date reasonably practicable in order that
all appropriate liquor licenses may be acquired by Purchaser at the earliest
reasonably practicable time after Closing (but the failure or inability of

relieve Purchaser of its obligation to proceed with Closing hereunder).
Purchasers attempts to obtain such liquor licenses shall not diminish, prior
to the Closing, the full force and effect of the liquor licenses maintained by
Permittee in the operation of the restaurants, lounges and bars presently
located within the Property. If any such liquor licenses cannot be obtained
by Purchaser until after Closing, then Seller shall cause the Permittee to
retain the Liquor License on behalf of the Hotel and Purchaser pursuant to the
Management Agreement. In no event shall Seller or Permittee be required to
obtain any additional liquor or alcoholic beverage licenses which it does not
possess at the time of Closing. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Guest Baggage. Any baggage or other property of departed
guests held by Seller may be left at the Hotel for a period not to exceed
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date. At any time during such period,
all such baggage or property will, at the option of Seller, be removed by

   14. | Employees. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Termination of Employees. Subject to the terms of the

the terms set forth below, or (ii) all

employees at the Hotel shall continue to be employed by Manager or its
affiliates for the benefit of Owner pursuant to the Management Agreement. In
either case Purchaser acknowledges that it is familiar with all existing
collective bargaining agreements covering employees at the Property, and
agrees to assume and be bound by such existing collective bargaining
agreement either directly or through Manager, as the case may be for
obligations arising from and after the Closing..



     | (b) | No Delivery of Layoff Notice to Employees. The parties agree
that no notices are required or shall be given under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Act, 29 USC §2101 et seq. or any state or local law,
(collectively, "WARN Act") and Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold
Seller, Manager, and their successors, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies
harmless from all liability under the WARN Act resulting from Purchaser or
its managers acts or omissions in connection with (a) the hiring, firing,
offering to hire, or failure to hire any of the current employees at the
Hotel; (b) Sellers termination of the employees at the Hotel by reason of
the sale of the Property to Purchaser; (c) the failure of Purchaser to rehire
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or (d) Purchasers direction
to Manager, to the extent permitted by the Management Agreement to fire any
employees. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the Closing. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Rehiring. If, pursuant to the Management Agreement, the
employees are to be terminated by Seller, then Purchaser shall, on or prior to
the Closing Date, offer employment effective on the Closing Date to not fewer
of the employees at the Property so as to not trigger any requirement for
notice under the WARN Act. Such employees shall be hired for the same
position, in full or part time status, and at not less than the hourly wage
rate currently being paid. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Firing of Managers Employees. If pursuant to the Management
Agreement, Manager or its affiliates will employ the employees of the Hotel,
Purchaser will not direct Manager to fire employees in any manner that would
trigger any requirement for notice under the WARN Act or otherwise violates
applicable law. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Benefits. Purchaser agrees to be responsible for, and to
indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from, all costs and expenses of
accrued and unpaid vacation and sick leave for all employees including
payroll taxes due in connection therewith to the extent the same do not exceed
the Benefits Credit; provided, however, that Purchaser shall receive a credit
against the Purchase Price for the sum equal to the aggregate amount of all
accrued and unpaid vacation and sick leave, including payroll taxes due in
connection therewith, for employees at the Property as of the Closing Date
("Benefits Credit"). If Seller will be terminating the employees and the
employees are being rehired by Purchaser, then to the extent required by
applicable law, Purchaser shall give each employee at the Property who is
employed by Seller as of the Closing Date an option and election whether to
receive payment of an amount equal to such employees Benefits Credit as of
the Closing Date or to continue to accrue and receive the benefit of such
Benefits Credit while employed by Purchaser after the Closing Date. The
covenants and agreements contained in this Paragraph 14(e) shall survive the
Closing and are not intended and shall not confer any benefit or right on any
person or entity other than the parties to this Agreement. Seller shall be and
remain solely responsible for payment of any other payroll and employee
benefits accrued in connection with employees at the Property for any period
prior to the Closing Date and shall indemnify, defend and hold Purchaser
harmless therefrom. 
---|---|--- 


     | (f) | Not a Successor. Nothing in this Agreement shall cause
Purchaser to be deemed to be a successor to Seller with respect to any matter
affecting the Property, including without limitation, the employment of its
employees. Seller shall remain solely liable for any and all claims arising
from Sellers use, occupancy or operation of, or employment or termination by
Seller of employees at the Property through the Closing Date, shall indemnify
Purchaser for any and all such claims and shall reimburse Purchasers
reasonable costs of the defense thereof. Purchaser shall remain solely liable
for any and all claims arising from Purchasers use, occupancy or operation
of, or employment or termination by Purchaser of employees at the Property on
and after the Closing Date, shall indemnify Seller for any and all such claims
and shall reimburse Sellers reasonable costs of the defense thereof.
Nothing in this __subsection (e)__ shall reduce, alter, waive, construe or
otherwise affect (a) any agreement between any one of the parties, on the one
hand, and any other party, on the other hand, pertaining to Sellers or
Purchasers rights against and obligations to such other parties with respect
to the Property, or (b) any right, remedy or defense at law, in equity or
otherwise. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | Credit for Payment by Purchaser. Solely for the purposes of
determining the reduction of Sellers liability pursuant to 29 U.S.C. §
2104(a)(2), but for no other purpose, Purchasers payment of wages, benefits
and other compensation to employees at the Hotel during any period of time
shall be deemed to have been paid by Seller also.

    15. | Loss by Fire, Other Casualty or Condemnation. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Material Damage. In the event that, prior to the Closing,
the Property is destroyed or materially damaged (as defined in __Section
15(c)__ below) by casualty, Purchaser shall have the right, exercisable by
giving notice to Seller within fifteen (15) days after receiving written
notice of such casualty, either (i) to terminate this Agreement, in which case
neither party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder except
that Purchaser will receive a refund of the Deposit and Purchaser and Seller
each shall be responsible for one-half of escrow cancellation fee, and
Purchaser shall remain obligated under __Section 3__ , or (ii) to accept the
Property in its then condition and to proceed with the Closing with an
abatement or reduction in the Purchase Price in the amount of the deductible
for the applicable insurance coverage, in which case Purchaser shall be
entitled to receive an assignment of all of Sellers rights to any insurance
proceeds payable by reason of such damage or destruction. If Purchaser elects
to proceed under clause (ii) above, Seller shall not compromise, settle or
adjust any claims to such proceeds without Purchasers prior written consent. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Non-Material Damage. In the event that, prior to the
Closing, there is any non-material damage to the Property caused by casualty,
Seller shall elect either (i) to repair or replace such damage to
substantially the same condition or better than that which existed prior to
the event prior to the Closing and Purchaser shall proceed with the Closing
following completion of such repair or replacement, or (ii) to proceed
to Closing without repair or replacement of the damage, in which case the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of any deductible for the
applicable insurance coverage and Purchaser shall be entitled to receive an
assignment of all of Sellers rights to any insurance proceeds payable by
reason of such damage or destruction; _provided, however,_ that any cost or
expense incurred by Seller in connection with repairing or replacing such
damage shall not be included in any closing or post-closing proration or
adjustment of the Purchase Price or otherwise credited to Sellers benefit in
connection with this transaction. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Definition of Material Damage. For purposes of this
__Section 15__ , damage to the Property shall be deemed to involve a material
portion thereof if the estimated cost of restoration or repair of such damage
reasonably estimated by Seller shall exceed the greater of (i) One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000) or (ii) ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 


     | (d) | Condemnation. In the event that, prior to the Closing, the
entire Property, or any substantial portion thereof, is subject to a
condemnation by a public authority, then Purchaser shall have the right,
exercisable by giving notice to Seller within fifteen (15) days after
receiving written notice of such taking, either (a) to terminate this
Agreement and obtain a refund of the Deposit, in which case neither
party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder, except that
Purchaser and Seller shall each be responsible for one half of any title or
Escrow cancellation fee and Purchaser shall remain obligated under __Section
3__ , or (b) to accept the Property in its then condition and proceed to
close this transaction, and to receive an assignment of all of Sellers rights
to any condemnation awards payable by reason of such condemnation. If
Purchaser elects to proceed under clause (b) above, Seller shall not
compromise, settle or adjust any claims to such awards without Purchasers
prior written consent. Seller agrees to give Purchaser prompt notice of any
threatened taking of the Property promptly after Seller receives notice of
the same. For the purposes of this Section 15(d) "substantial portion" shall
mean that number of parking spaces, that if lost, would cause the Property to
not be in compliance with applicable governmental parking requirements or any
portion of the Property valued, in the reasonable estimate of Seller, at the
greater of (i) One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or (ii) ten percent (10%) of
the Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 


   16. | Default. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the
event of a default hereunder, the parties shall have all the rights available
to them in law and equity, except that: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | LIQUIDATED DAMAGES - DEPOSIT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO
THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, IF THE CLOSING DOES NOT OCCUR AS A
RESULT OF PURCHASERS DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, SELLER SHALL BE ENTITLED
TO RETAIN THE DEPOSIT AS SELLERS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT
IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICABLE AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN THE ACTUAL
DAMAGES SUFFERED BY SELLER AS A RESULT OF PURCHASERS FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE
PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE, THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE DAMAGES
WHICH SELLER WILL INCUR AS A RESULT OF SUCH FAILURE, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT
THIS PROVISION SHALL NOT LIMIT SELLERS RIGHTS TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR
ATTORNEYS FEES, NOR WAIVE OR AFFECT SELLERS RIGHTS AND PURCHASERS
INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS

AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PAYMENT OF SUCH LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
IS NOT INTENDED AS A FORFEITURE OR PENALTY WITHIN THE MEANING OF ANY
APPLICABLE STATUTE OR LAW, BUT IS INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO
SELLER. THE PARTIES HAVE SET FORTH THEIR INITIALS BELOW TO INDICATE THEIR
AGREEMENT WITH THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.

responsible for any title or escrow cancellation fee; or (2) if Purchaser is

to this Agreement, and such ability is evidenced by the delivery of the
Purchase Price to Escrow Holder as and when due hereunder, and Seller refuses
to convey title to the Property to Purchaser (except in the event of the
failure of any of Sellers Conditions Precedent), Purchaser may file
an action for specific performance of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Purchaser Aware that Sellers Representations Untrue. If

documents and instruments reasonably required in order to consummate the

---|---|--- 



     | (k) | Successors and Assigns. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Purchaser shall have the right to assign all of its right,
title and interest in, to and under this Agreement to any Affiliate of
Purchaser that has been approved as a franchisee of Hilton Hotels
Corporation, but to no other person or entity (herein "Person") without the

profits or similar economic benefit from the controlled Person; and "control"
means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause

assumption agreement with respect thereto in favor of Seller, duly executed by
Purchaser and the assignee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

void. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the

hold the other harmless from and against any and all claims for brokerage
commissions and fees or finders fees payable in connection with the sale of
the Property or the transactions covered and contemplated by this Agreement
resulting from the act or omission of such indemnifying party. Sellers Broker
shall be compensated directly by Seller in accordance with a separate listing
agreement between Seller and Sellers Broker. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed to confer any third party benefit on any broker or any other
person not a party hereto with respect to this Agreement. Each party
represents and warrants to the other that it has not dealt with any brokers,
agents or others in connection with the transaction contemplated herein which
would give rise to any claim for a sales commission, finders fee, or fee or
commission of a similar kind or nature. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (o) | Construction of Agreement. The language in all parts of this
Agreement shall be in all cases construed simply according to its fair meaning
and not strictly for or against any of the parties hereto. When required by
the context, whenever the singular number is used in this Agreement, the same
shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular, the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders, and vice
versa. As used in this Agreement, the term "Seller" shall include the

and not business days. However, should any expiration date, due date or other
time period fall on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday on which the New York Stock
Exchange is closed for business for the entire day, such expiration date, due
date or time period shall be extended to the next business day. 
---|---|--- 


     | (q) | Announcements. Seller and Purchaser shall consult with each
other with regard to all press releases and other announcements issued at or
prior to the Closing concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by applicable laws or the
applicable rules and regulations of any governmental agency or stock exchange,

---|---|--- 



     | (r) | Exchange Cooperation. Either party shall be permitted to
assign its obligations under this Agreement to an intermediary for the purpose
of effectuating a tax-deferred exchange, so long as such assignment shall not

any additional obligations, incur any out-of-pocket expenses, or take title to
any other property. Neither party shall be, in any way, responsible or liable
for the tax or other consequences of the tax-deferred exchange (or attempted

     | (s) | Sellers Approval of Sale. The sale of the Property as
described herein is subject to approval by one or more committees of Seller
given oversight responsibility for the disposition of property. In the event

before the Contingency Expiration Date, this Agreement shall terminate
immediately and the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser. If Seller fails
to terminate this Agreement on or before the Contingency Expiration Agreement
Seller shall be deemed to have waived the contingency contained in this
section 17(s). 
---|---|--- 


     | (t) | No Effect Until Mutual Execution. The submission of this
Agreement by Seller, its agent or representative for examination or execution
by Purchaser does not constitute an option or offer to sell the Property upon
the terms and conditions contained herein or a reservation of the Property in
favor of Purchaser, it being intended hereby that this Agreement shall only
become effective upon the execution hereof by Seller and Purchaser and
delivery of a fully executed agreement to Purchaser and Escrow Holder.
