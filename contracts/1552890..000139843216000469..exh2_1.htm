<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; text-indent:48px">WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Tender Offer, the Parties intend that Acquisition will be merged (the &#147;Merger&#148;) with and into the Company without the approval of the Company's stockholders in accordance with Section 3-106.1 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the &#147;MGCL&#148;), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the &#147;Surviving Corporation&#148;), and as a result of the Merger the remaining untendered shares of Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive cash equal to the Tender Offer Price, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Merger shall be governed by and effected following the consummation of the Tender Offer pursuant to Section 3-106.1 of the MGCL;</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; text-indent:48px">WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;Board&#148;), acting upon the recommendation of the independent special committee of the Board consisting of the director who is not employed by or otherwise affiliated with Parent, ARMOUR Capital Management LP, a Delaware limited partnership (&#147;ACM&#148;), or any of their respective subsidiaries (the &#147;Special Committee&#148;), has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement, the Transactions (as defined below) and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it, consisting of the Tender Offer and the Merger (together with the Tender Offer, the &#147;Transactions&#148;) and (iii) determined to recommend that the Company&#146;s stockholders tender their shares of Common Stock in response to the Tender Offer, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;</P>
<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:11.133px; text-indent:48px">WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Acquisition have approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Transactions, subject to the terms and conditions provided for in this Agreement;</P>

The Special Committee and its counsel will be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents and any amendments or supplements to them before they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to the Company's stockholders, and Parent and Acquisition shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Special Committee and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Acquisition shall (i) provide the Special Committee and its counsel with copies of any written comments, (ii) inform them about any oral comments, that Parent or Acquisition or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, (iii) consult with the Special Committee and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments and (iv) provide the Special Committee with copies of all such written responses (or if oral responses, summaries thereof). Subject to the preceding sentence, Parent and Acquisition shall respond promptly to any comments received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents and take all other commercially reasonable actions necessary to resolve the issues raised therein, except to the extent any comments received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents might require a delay or certain actions which might reasonably be viewed as detrimental to the Company or its stockholders, in which case no action may be taken without approval of the Special Committee.</P>
