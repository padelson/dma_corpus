AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated as of March 1,
2016, among JAVELIN Mortgage Investment Corp. (the "Company"), a Maryland
corporation, ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. ("Parent"), a Maryland corporation,
and JMI Acquisition Corporation ("Acquisition" and, together with the Company
and Parent, each a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), a Maryland
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

WHEREAS, Parent proposes to cause Acquisition to commence a tender offer (as
it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the
"Tender Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
the Company, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock"), subject to the
condition that greater than fifty percent (50%) of the total number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock which are not owned immediately before the
Expiration Time (as defined below) by Parent, any of its subsidiaries, or any
officers or directors of Parent, or the Company are validly tendered and not
withdrawn (the "Minimum Condition"), at a price per share equal to the Tender
Offer Price (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Tender Offer, the Parties intend
that Acquisition will be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company
without the approval of the Company\'s stockholders in accordance with Section
3-106.1 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL"), with the Company
surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Surviving
Corporation"), and as a result of the Merger the remaining untendered shares
of Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive cash equal to the
Tender Offer Price, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and the Merger shall be governed by and effected following the
consummation of the Tender Offer pursuant to Section 3-106.1 of the MGCL;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), acting upon the
recommendation of the independent special committee of the Board consisting of
the director who is not employed by or otherwise affiliated with Parent,
ARMOUR Capital Management LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("ACM"), or any
of their respective subsidiaries (the "Special Committee"), has unanimously
(i) determined that this Agreement, the Transactions (as defined below) and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by it, consisting of the Tender
Offer and the Merger (together with the Tender Offer, the "Transactions") and
(iii) determined to recommend that the Companys stockholders tender their
shares of Common Stock in response to the Tender Offer, in each case subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Acquisition have
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Transactions, subject to the terms and conditions provided for in this
Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, no vote of the stockholders of Parent is required in connection with
the Transactions;

 

WHEREAS, the Special Committee has received the opinion of its financial
advisor that the consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock
pursuant to the Transactions is fair to such holders from a financial point of
view; and

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Acquisition are willing to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Transactions and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Transactions, as
set forth herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound, the Parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1 
 THE TENDER OFFER

 

1.1

 

 _ _Announcement of this Agreement and the Tender Offer__. Not later than the
first business day after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company
will each make a public announcement of this Agreement and the Transactions.
"Business Day" is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday on which
banks in New York City generally are closed for business. The announcements
shall be filed by Parent with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
on such forms, in such manner and at such times as required under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"). If required to
ensure that Parents announcements will not constitute the commencement of a
tender offer, such filings will be marked to show that they contain pre-
commencement communications.

 


  

 

1

   

1.2

 

 _ _The Offer.__ Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated
pursuant to Article 8 hereof and that no event shall have occurred and be
continuing that, had the Tender Offer been commenced, would give rise to a
right to terminate the Tender Offer pursuant to any of the conditions set
forth in Exhibit 1.2-E, as promptly as reasonably practicable (or by such
other date as the Parties may mutually agree in writing), but in no event
later than 10 Business Days following the date of this Agreement, Acquisition
shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition to, commence, within the meaning of
the Exchange Act, the Tender Offer by offering to purchase all of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, subject to the Minimum Condition, for an
amount in cash per share (the "Tender Offer Price") equal to 87% of the book
value per share of Common Stock ("BVPS"), as of 5:00 P.M. New York City time
on the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the expiration of the
Tender Offer (the "Calculation Date"). BVPS shall be calculated by the
Company, subject to the review and approval of the Special Committee, using
the following data: (i) the market value of the Companys agency securities
and derivatives as of the Calculation Date, (ii) the appraised value of the
Companys non-agency securities as of the Calculation Date or the most recent
prior date as of which such value can be determined, (iii) cash balances in
the Companys bank accounts as of the Calculation Date, (iv) the Company\'s
repurchase agreement balances and interest payable to repurchase
counterparties as of the Calculation Date, and (v) any other tangible assets
or liabilities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, consistently applied ("GAAP"), including accruals, as of the
Calculation Date, less $1.0 million to account for the Company\'s expenses
related to the Transactions not included in the above-referenced accruals.
B  VPS shall be calculated as set forth on   _  Schedule 1.2  _
  and shall be certified by an authorized representative of the Company as
true and accurate in all material respects. Estimates of BVPS shall be
calculated as of 5:00 P.M., New York City time and posted to the Companys
website as soon as reasonably practicable on the date that the Tender Offer is
commenced and on every Business Day thereafter until the Calculation Date.
Thereafter, through the Expiration Date (as defined below), the Tender Offer
Price shall be posted on the Companys website. The Tender Offer shall be made
by means of an offer to purchase that describes the terms and conditions of
the Tender Offer in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(a)

 

On the date of the commencement of the Tender Offer, Acquisition will (and
Parent will cause Acquisition to), if it has not already done so, file with
the SEC a combined Schedule 13E-3/Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Tender Offer (together with any amendments or supplements that
have been made or are made in the future, the "Schedule TO"), including forms
of an offer to purchase, a letter of transmittal and a summary advertisement
(the Schedule TO and the documents included in it by which the Tender Offer
will be made, as they may be supplemented or amended, being the "Offer
Documents") and the notice referred to in Section 3-106.1(e)(1) of the MGCL
(the "Maryland Short Form Merger Notice"). Promptly after that, Acquisition
will communicate the Tender Offer and deliver the Offer Documents and the
Maryland Short Form Merger Notice to the record holders and beneficial owners
of Common Stock in accordance with applicable Law. Parent and Acquisition
shall cause the Offer Documents to comply as to form in all respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable rules and regulations of the
New York Stock Exchange and any other applicable Laws. Each of Parent,
Acquisition and the Company will promptly correct any information provided by
it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that information is or
becomes incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, and Parent and
Acquisition will supplement or amend the Offer Documents to the extent
required by the Exchange Act, file the amended or supplemented Offer Documents
with the SEC and, if required, disseminate the amended Offer Documents or
supplements to the Companys stockholders. The Special Committee and its
counsel will be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents and any amendments or supplements to them before they are
filed with the SEC or disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, and Parent
and Acquisition shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Special Committee and its
counsel. In addition, Parent and Acquisition shall (i) provide the Special
Committee and its counsel with copies of any written comments, (ii) inform
them about any oral comments, that Parent or Acquisition or their counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, (iii) consult with the
Special Committee and its counsel prior to responding to any such comments and
(iv) provide the Special Committee with copies of all such written responses
(or if oral responses, summaries thereof). Subject to the preceding sentence,
Parent and Acquisition shall respond promptly to any comments received from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents and take all other
commercially reasonable actions necessary to resolve the issues raised
therein, except to the extent any comments received from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents might require a delay or certain actions
which might reasonably be viewed as detrimental to the Company or its
stockholders, in which case no action may be taken without approval of the
Special Committee.

 

(b)

 

Unless extended as required or permitted by this Agreement, the day on which
the Tender Offer expires (the "Expiration Date") will be no earlier than the
20th Business Day, nor later than the 75th day, after the day on which the
Schedule TO (or any amendment(s) thereto) that includes the Offer Documents
(the "Offer TO") is filed with the SEC, or, if the Tender Offer has been
extended as required or permitted by this Agreement, the date to which the
Tender Offer has been so extended. The time on the Expiration Date at which
the Tender Offer will expire is referred to as the "Expiration Time." Parent
and Acquisition shall not terminate the Tender Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Time (including any rescheduled Expiration Time) without the prior
written consent of the Company, except in the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article 8.

 


  

 

2

   

(c)

 

If at the scheduled Expiration Time any of the conditions set forth on Exhibit
1.2-E shall not have been satisfied or waived by Parent or Acquisition (if
permitted hereunder), then Acquisition shall (and Parent shall cause
Acquisition to) extend the Tender Offer for one or more successive periods of
up to 10 Business Days each in order to permit the satisfaction of such
conditions; _provided_ , that Parent and Acquisition will not be required to
extend the Tender Offer for more than three successive periods of 10 Business
Days each and no extension of the Tender Offer will be required to extend past
the earlier of (A) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8
hereof, and (B) the Tender Outside Date (as defined below).

 

(d)

 

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Tender Offer
set forth on Exhibit 1.2-E, Acquisition will (and Parent shall cause
Acquisition to), promptly after the Expiration Time (and in any event in
compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act), accept for payment and
pay for all the shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer on or before the applicable Expiration
Time. Subject to Section 2.10(c), the Tender Offer Price payable in respect of
each share of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Tender Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without
interest. Acquisition will not modify or waive the condition in paragraph (a)
on Exhibit 1.2-E to reduce the Minimum Condition. In addition, Acquisition
will not, without the prior consent of the Company, (i) decrease the Tender
Offer Price, (ii) decrease the number of shares of Common Stock being
solicited in the Tender Offer, (iii) change the form of consideration payable
in the Tender Offer, (iv) modify, amend or add to the conditions set forth on
Exhibit 1.2-E, including amending or waiving the Minimum Condition, (v) add
any condition to the Tender Offer or (vi) extend the Expiration Date to a day
which is more than 75 days after the day on which the Offer TO is filed with
the SEC, except that (A) if the Tender Offer is modified to increase the
Tender Offer Price or in any other manner permitted by this Agreement, the
Expiration Date may be extended until 10 Business Days after the day on which
Acquisition makes a public announcement of the modification, (B) if anyone
other than Acquisition makes a tender offer for shares of Common Stock before
the Tender Offer expires, Acquisition may extend the Expiration Date until not
later than 10 Business Days after the other tender offer expires, (C) if the
Company delivers a Superior Proposal Notice (as defined below), Parent may
extend the Expiration Date until not later than 10 Business Days after the
last day on which Parent is permitted under Section 8.1(f) to deliver a Price
Increase Notice (as defined below), or the last day of the two Business Day
negotiation period under Section 8.1(g), and if Parent delivers a Price
Increase Notice by the last day permitted under Section 8.1(f), or if a
Superior Proposal Notice given under Section 8.1(g) is withdrawn without this
Agreement terminating, Parent may extend the Expiration Date until not later
than 10 Business Days (or such longer period as is required by applicable SEC
rules or by law) after the day on which Parent delivers the Price Increase
Notice or the Superior Proposal Notice under Section 8.1(g) is withdrawn (or
until such later date as is agreed upon by the Company, with the approval of
the Special Committee, and by Parent), and (D) if Acquisition is prevented by
an order of a court or other governmental agency from accepting shares of
Common Stock which are tendered in response to the Tender Offer, Acquisition
may extend the Expiration Date until not later than 10 Business Days after
Acquisition is able to accept shares of Common Stock without violating any
order of any court or other governmental agency. Acquisition may extend the
Tender Offer for a subsequent offer period after the Expiration Date as
permitted by Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

 

(e)

 

If at least two Business Days before the scheduled Expiration Date, the
Company delivers a Superior Proposal Notice to Parent and Acquisition as
described in clause (iii) of Section 8.1(f), the Expiration Date will
automatically be extended to the fourth Business Day after the day on which
the Company delivers the Superior Proposal Notice to Parent, subject to
compliance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

 

(f)

 

In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 8,
Acquisition shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition to) (i) within one
Business Day after such termination, terminate the Tender Offer, (ii) not
acquire any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Tender Offer and (iii)
cause any depository acting on behalf of Acquisition to return, in accordance
with applicable Law, all tendered shares of Common Stock to the record holders
thereof.

 

1.3

 

 _ _Company__ _ _ _ _Action_._

 

(a)

 

(i) The Special Committee and the Board each has adopted resolutions in which
it has determined that this Agreement, the Transactions, and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) the Special Committee
recommended that the Board approve this Agreement, the Transactions and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the Board approved
this Agreement, the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (iv) the Board, subject to Sections 8.1(f), 8.1(g) and
8.1(h), determined to recommend that the Companys stockholders tender their
shares of Common Stock in response to the Tender Offer. However,
notwithstanding anything contained in this paragraph (a) or elsewhere in this
Agreement, if the Special Committee or the Board, after consultation with
counsel, determines in good faith to withdraw or modify the recommendation,
because the failure to do so could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the duties of the members of the Special Committee or of the members of
the entire Board under applicable law, then the Special Committee and the
Board may withdraw or modify their respective recommendations accordingly.

 


  

 

3

   

(b)

 

The Company will file with the SEC, promptly after Acquisition files the Offer
TO, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
any amendments or supplements, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing the
recommendations described in subparagraph (a) and will disseminate the
Schedule 14D-9 to holders of shares of Common Stock as and to the extent
required by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act. Parent and Acquisition shall
promptly furnish to the Company in writing any information concerning Parent
and Acquisition that may be required by applicable Law for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition, on
the other hand, each will promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information is or
becomes incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect and the Company will
file any corrected Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC and disseminate the corrected
Schedule 14D-9 to the Companys stockholders to the extent required by the
Exchange Act or the rules under it.

 

(c)

 

In connection with the Tender Offer, the Company will promptly furnish
Acquisition with mailing labels, security position listings and any other
available listing or computer files containing the names and addresses of the
record holders or, to the extent known to the Company, beneficial owners of
shares of Common Stock as of a recent date and the Company will furnish
Acquisition with such additional information and assistance (including,
without limitation, updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of
securities positions) as Acquisition or its representatives may reasonably
request in order to communicate the Tender Offer to the record holders and
beneficial owners of Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, Acquisition will hold in confidence the information contained in any such
labels, listings or files, and will use that information only in connection
with the Tender Offer and the Merger. If this Agreement is terminated before
Acquisition accepts tendered shares, Acquisition will return to the Company
the originals and all copies of that information which are in Acquisitions
possession or control.

 

1.4

 

 _ _Special Committee_._

 

(a)

 

Parent and the Company will at all times do all things in their power so that

tendered in response to the Tender Offer and not withdrawn, and (iii) the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Section 7.2 are satisfied or waived,

foregoing, the Merger shall be governed by Section 3-106.1 of the MGCL and the

accordance therewith. The Maryland Short Form Merger Notice will be
disseminated with the Offer Documents to the holders of record of shares of
Common Stock to ensure compliance with Section 3-106.1(e) of the MGCL.

 

2.2

 

 _ _The__ _ _ _ _Merger__. In the Merger, Acquisition will be merged with and
into the Company without the approval of the Companys stockholders in
accordance with Section 3-106.1 of the MGCL, and the Company will be the
Surviving Corporation of the Merger. Except as specifically provided in this
Agreement, when the Merger becomes effective, (i) the real and personal
property, other assets, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, purposes and
franchises of the Company will continue unaffected and unimpaired by the

immunities, powers, purposes and franchises will transfer to, vest in and
devolve on the Surviving Corporation, and (iii) the Merger will have the other
effects specified in Section 3-114 of the MGCL.

2.3

 

 _ _Charter__. Immediately after the Effective Time, the charter of
Acquisition shall be the charter of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by applicable
Law.

 

2.4

 

 _ _Bylaws__. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Acquisition
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in
accordance with their terms and as provided by applicable Law.

the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time and will hold
office in accordance with applicable Law and the Surviving Corporations
organizational documents.

 

2.6

 

 _ _Officers__. The officers of the Company immediately before the Effective
Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective
Time and will hold office at the pleasure of the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation and in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

2.7

 

 _ _Stock of the Company_. _At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition or the Company or any
holder of any securities of any of the foregoing:

 

(a)

 

 _Cancellation of Acquisition- or Parent-Owned Company Common Stock_. Each
outstanding or issued share of Common Stock that is owned by Parent or
Acquisition or by any Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition or the Company,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including each share of Common Stock
that has been irrevocably accepted for purchase by Acquisition in the Tender
Offer (which shares shall be treated as set forth in Section 2.7(b)) (except
to the extent held by any such Person on behalf of a third party)
(collectively, the "Excluded Shares"), shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no cash, stock or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(b)

 

 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Excluded Shares) shall automatically be converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount, without interest, equal to the Tender Offer Price (the
"Merger Price"). 

 

2.8

 

 _ _Stock__ _ _ _ _of Acquisition__. At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock of Acquisition, par value $0.001 per share, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $0.001 per share. At the
Effective Time, a certificate which represented shares of Acquisition common
stock will be a certificate representing the same number of shares of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

2.9

 

 _ _Merger without Stockholder Vote__. If the Minimum Condition is met and
Acquisition purchases the shares of Common Stock that are validly tendered in
response to the Tender Offer and not withdrawn, and Acquisition owns a
majority of the total number of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the
Company will cause the Merger to be effected following the consummation of the
Tender Offer as promptly as practicable without a vote of the holders of
Common Stock, in accordance with Section 3-106.1 of the MGCL. 

 

2.10

 

 _ _Payment__ _ _ _ _for__ _ _ _ _Shares__.

 

(a)

 

Prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition will designate, with the Companys
prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), a bank or trust company to
act as Paying Agent in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). At, or
immediately before, the Effective Time, Acquisition will, and Parent shall
cause Acquisition to, provide the Paying Agent with the funds necessary to
make the payments under the rights contemplated by Section 2.7. Until used for
that purpose, the funds will be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by
the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America
which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America,
in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Services Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, or in deposit
accounts, certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of, repurchase or
reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased
from, commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and undivided
profits aggregating more than $10 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of the banks which are then publicly available).

 

(b)

 

Promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
person who was a record holder of Common Stock at the Effective Time, a form
of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of stock
certificates representing Common Stock ("Certificates") in order to receive
payment of the Merger Price. When the Paying Agent receives a Certificate,
together with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal and any
other required documents, the Paying Agent will pay to the holder of the
shares represented by the Certificate, or as otherwise directed in the letter
of transmittal, the Merger Price with regard to those shares, and the
Certificate will be cancelled. Book entry transfer of shares to the Paying
Agent will have the same effect as delivery of a Certificate with respect to
those shares. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the
surrender of Certificates. If payment is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name a surrendered Certificate is registered, the surrendered
Certificate must be properly endorsed or otherwise

 


  

 

5

   



 

be in proper form for transfer, and the person who surrenders the Certificate
must provide funds for payment of any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the record holder of the
surrendered Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that the tax has been paid. After the Effective Time, a
Certificate which has not been surrendered will represent only the right to
receive the Merger Price, without any interest.

 

(c)

 

The Paying Agent may withhold from the sum payable to any person as a result
of the Merger, and pay to the appropriate taxing authorities, any amounts
which the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation is required, or reasonably
believes it is required, to withhold under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of any state, local or foreign tax
law. Any sum which is withheld and paid to a taxing authority as permitted by
this paragraph will be deemed to have been paid to the person with regard to
whom it is withheld. The Parties shall provide and to make customary requests
for information and documentation allowing for the avoidance of withholding.

 

(d)

 

If a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation
will accept an affidavit and indemnification reasonably satisfactory to it
instead of the Certificate.

 

(e)

 

At any time which is more than six months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation may require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds
which had been made available to the Paying Agent and have not been disbursed
to former holders of shares of Common Stock (including, without limitation,
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of the funds
made available to it), and after the funds have been delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, former stockholders of the Company must look to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Price upon surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying
Agent will be liable to any former stockholder of the Company for any Merger
consideration which is delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(f)

 

After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will not record any
transfers of shares of Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company
or the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented for transfer, they will be cancelled and treated as having been
surrendered for the Merger Price (which will be paid upon receipt of a
properly completed Letter of Transmittal and any other required documents).

 

(g)

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date
of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, business combination, tender or
exchange offer, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend
or stock distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within such
period, the Tender Offer Price and the Merger Price shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided,
however, that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount payable by Parent or
Acquisition pursuant to this Section 2.10 after giving effect to any such
event exceed the amount that would have been payable pursuant to this Section
2.10 had such event not occurred and (ii) nothing in this Section 2.10 shall
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
expressly prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement, the Transactions or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (subject, with respect to the Merger, to the filing of the Articles

Department). This Agreement has been duly executed by the Company and,
assuming this Agreement has been duly executed by Parent and Acquisition, is a
valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms (except to the extent that such enforceability (i)
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar laws of general application affecting or relating
to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to
general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in

(c)

 

The Special Committee has received and considered in connection with its
decision to make the recommendation to the Board described in the next
sentence, an opinion, dated as of the date hereof, of JMP Securities LLC
("JMP") as financial advisor to the Special Committee, to the effect that,
subject to the limitations and assumptions set forth therein, as of the date

financial point of view to the Companys stockholders.

modified or withdrawn in any way.

 

(e)

event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
under, the Charter or Bylaws of the Company, any agreement or instrument to
which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which any
of them is bound, any law, or any order, rule or regulation of any court or

"Company Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect upon (i) the
consolidated financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, (ii) the consolidated results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, during a fiscal year compared with what those
consolidated results of operations would have been during that fiscal year but

of this Agreement, (H) any decline in the market price, or change in trading
volume, of Common Stock or any failure of the Company to meet internal
projections or forecasts, or projections or forecasts of any other person, of

limiting what is said in the preceding sentence, the financial statements
included in the Company 10-K all were prepared, and the financial information
included in the September 30 10-Q was derived from financial statements which

use by, Parent, Acquisition or any other person of any such information,
including any documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Parent, Acquisition or any other person in "data rooms" or
management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, unless and then only to the extent that any such information
is expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in Section 4.1
or elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

4.3

 

 _ _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Acquisition__. Except (i) as
disclosed in any report, schedule, form or other document filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC after January 1, 2013 and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement, or (ii) as disclosed in the corresponding section
of the disclosure schedules attached to this Agreement, (it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section of the disclosure schedules shall also
be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this Agreement to
which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face) Parent
and Acquisition each represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

 

(a)

 

Parent and Acquisition each is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Maryland.

 

(b)

 

Parent and Acquisition each has all corporate power and authority necessary to
enable it to enter into this Agreement and carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. All corporate actions necessary to authorize
each of Parent and Acquisition to enter into this Agreement and carry out the
transactions contemplated by it have been taken. This Agreement has been duly
executed by each of Parent and Acquisition and (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company) is a valid and binding
agreement of each of Parent and Acquisition, enforceable against each of them
in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that such enforceability
(i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general application
affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and
(ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

 

(c)

 

Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement or of any document to be
delivered in accordance with this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by any document to be delivered
in accordance with this Agreement will violate, result in a breach of, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a default) under, the Charter or Bylaws of either Parent or
Acquisition, any agreement or instrument to which either Parent or Acquisition
or any subsidiary of either of them is a party or by which any of them is
bound, any law, or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental
agency or other regulatory organization having jurisdiction over Parent,
Acquisition or any of their respective subsidiaries, except violations or
breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the ability of Parent and Acquisition to
consummate the Tender Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(d)

 

Except for (i) the filing with the SEC of the Schedule TO, reports on Form 8-K
and any related or other filings required under, and compliance with, the
applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act, (ii) the filing of Articles of
Merger with the Department pursuant to the MGCL and other filings and notices
to be made by Company as provided hereunder, (iii) compliance with state
securities and Takeover Laws and the filing of documents with various state
securities authorities that may be required in connection with the
Transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) filings and notices required as a
result of facts and circumstances attributable solely to the Company, no
governmental filings, authorizations, approvals or consents, or other
governmental action are required to permit Parent and Acquisition to fulfill
all their obligations under this Agreement.

 

(e)

 

Acquisition was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Acquisition has not, and on the Effective Date
will not have, engaged in any activities or incurred, directly or indirectly,
any obligations or liabilities, except the activities relating to or
contemplated by this Agreement and obligations or liabilities incurred in
connection with those activities and with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

(f)

 

Neither any of the Offer Documents nor any information supplied by Parent or
Acquisition for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) will, at the respective times the Schedule TO (or
amendment to it) that contains the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 is
filed with the SEC or the Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 are first sent
to the Company\'s stockholders and at the Expiration Date, contain an untrue
statement with respect to any material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated or included in it or necessary in order to make the
statements made or included in it, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. However, Acquisition does not make any
representation or warranty with respect to information supplied by the Company
or any of its affiliates or representatives for inclusion in the Offer
Documents, or with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 (except to the extent of
information supplied by Parent or Acquisition for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9). The Offer Documents will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules under it.

 


  

 

10

   

(g)

 

Acquisition is wholly owned by Parent. Parent has sufficient funds to enable
Parent to fulfill its obligations under Section 11.1 and otherwise in this
Agreement, and therefore to enable Acquisition to purchase and immediately pay
for all shares of Common Stock which are tendered in response to the Tender
Offer and enable Acquisition to immediately fulfill all its obligations with
regard to the Merger, any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Parent, Acquisition and the Surviving Corporation in connection with
Transactions and all its other obligations under this Agreement.

 

(h)

 

Neither Acquisition nor Parent is the subject of any suit or governmental
proceeding (in which service or notice of process has been received by either
of them) which seeks to prevent Acquisition from completing the transactions
which are the subject of this Agreement, nor, to the best of the knowledge of
any officer of Parent has any such suit or proceeding been threatened.

 

(i)

 

None of Parent, Acquisition or any of their affiliates beneficially owns or
owns of record (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act), or will
prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement (other than as a result of the Transactions contemplated hereby),
beneficially own or own of record any shares of Common Stock.

 

(j)

 

Neither Parent nor Acquisition nor any of their "affiliates" (as defined in
Section 3-601 of the MGCL) is an "interested stockholder" (as defined in
Section 3-601 of the MGCL) of the Company.

 

(k)

 

Parent has elected to be taxed as a REIT and is operating in a manner that
will enable it to qualify as a REIT during 2016.

 

4.4

 

 _ _No Implied Representations and Warranties by Parent or Acquisition__.
Except for the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.3, the
Company acknowledges that neither Parent nor Acquisition, nor any person on
behalf of Parent or Acquisition, makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Acquisition, or any of
their respective subsidiaries, or with respect to any other information
provided or made available to the Company in connection with the Transactions.

 

4.5

 

 _ _Termination of Representations and Warranties_. _The representations and
warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.3 and 9.1 will terminate at such, if any, time
as Acquisition purchases through the Tender Offer any of the shares of Common
Stock that are tendered in response to the Tender Offer. No party will have
any rights or claims as a result of any representations and warranties after
they terminate.

 

4.6

 

 _ _No Liability of Company regarding Incorrect Representations and
Warranties_. _Even if representations and warranties of the Company in Section
4.1 are not correct and complete in all material respects, neither Acquisition
nor Parent will be entitled to any damages from the Company because the
representations and warranties are not correct and complete in all material
respects. The sole remedy of Acquisition and Parent because one or more
representations and warranties are not correct and complete in all material
respects will be for Parent to terminate this Agreement as provided in Section
8.1.

 

ARTICLE 5 
 PROPOSALS FROM OTHER PERSONS

 

5.1

 

 _ _No Solicitation of Offers; Notice of Proposals from Others__.

 

(a)

 

Until such, if any, time as this Agreement terminates without Acquisitions
purchasing the shares of Common Stock that are properly tendered in response
to the Tender Offer and not withdrawn, except as provided in Section 5.1(b),
the Company will (i) terminate all ongoing discussions regarding merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction involving
the Company, or a purchase of or tender offer for a majority of the Companys
equity securities or a majority of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis (each of those transactions being an
"Acquisition Transaction", a proposal or offer to enter into an Acquisition
Transaction being an "Acquisition Proposal" and a person who makes an
Acquisition Proposal being a "Potential Acquiror"), (ii) not authorize or
permit its or any of its subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, agents
or representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or by any of its subsidiaries) or any other person directly or
indirectly to initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or otherwise knowingly
facilitate (by making available non-public information or otherwise) any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer
with respect to a possible Acquisition Transaction, and (iii) not enter into
any agreement with anyone other than Parent or Acquisition regarding an
Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by
Section 5.1(b)).

 


  

 

11

   

(b)

 

Paragraph (a) will not prevent the Company from providing non-public
information about the Company and its subsidiaries (subject to a
confidentiality agreement that has substantially the same terms as those
contained in Section 12.2(b) of this Agreement) to, and engaging in
discussions and negotiations regarding a possible Acquisition Transaction
with, a prospective acquirer in response to an Acquisition Proposal which the
Company receives that did not result in whole or in part from a breach of
Section 5.1(a), and which the Special Committee, determines, after
consultation with its legal advisors and independent financial advisor, would
result (if consummated in accordance with its terms) in, or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below).

 

(c)

 

If the Board, the Special Committee or the Company, directly or through its
advisors, receives an Acquisition Proposal or a request for non-public
information or an indication that a prospective acquirer intends to make an
Acquisition Proposal, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within one
Business Day, after the Special Committee receives the Acquisition Proposal or
request for non-public information relating to the Company that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company will
inform Parent about the Acquisition Proposal or request including the identity
of the person who made or intends to make an Acquisition Proposal and a
reasonably detailed description of the material proposed terms of the
Acquisition Proposal (including the proposed purchase consideration), and the
Company will promptly, from time to time, provide Parent with any additional
material information the Special Committee or the Company obtains regarding
the Acquisition Proposal.

 

5.2

 

 _ _Waiver of Standstill Provisions__. Anything to the contrary herein
notwithstanding, Parent and Acquisition hereby acknowledge that in connection
with this Agreement, the Company shall waive the applicability of and release
any person who entered into a confidentiality agreement with the Company in
connection with a possible acquisition of the Company or a significant portion
of its assets containing standstill provisions in connection with the
Transactions or the solicitation of proposals related to the process
undertaken by the Special Committee resulting in such Transactions, from the
standstill provisions of such confidentiality agreement. 

 

5.3

 

 _ _Return of Materials Subject to Confidentiality Agreements.__ The Company
will, or will instruct ACM to, as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, request that any person holding or possessing materials provided during
the one-year period prior to the date of this Agreement under a
confidentiality agreement entered into in connection with a possible
acquisition of the Company or a significant portion of its assets (other than
through sales in the ordinary course of business), and any person to which the
Company provided materials containing non-public information that does not
make a written Acquisition Proposal, promptly return those materials to the
Company or to destroy those materials, and the Company will, and will instruct
ACM to, endeavor in good faith to obtain compliance with that request.

that the Company and each of its subsidiaries will, except (a) with the

dividends (payable through the month of March 2016) paid by the Company
consistent with its past practice of paying monthly dividends based upon its

with past practice) and as otherwise necessary to maintain the Companys
qualification as a REIT.

continue to satisfy all requirements to qualify as a REIT under Section 856 of
the Code.

 

(p)

 

Not enter into any agreements, including any agreements in connection with the
settlement of litigation, that would restrict the ability of the Surviving
Corporation to engage after the Effective Time in all the activities in which
the Company is engaged as of the date of this Agreement or that would
materially restrict the ability of Parent or Acquisition to engage in any
activities after Acquisition purchases the shares of Common Stock that are
tendered in response to the Tender Offer.

 

(q)

 

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, not enter into any agreements that
would make it impossible for Acquisition to acquire through the Tender Offer
the shares of Common Stock or for the Merger to take place when and as
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(r)

 

Not authorize or enter into any agreement to take any of the actions referred
to in subparagraphs (a) through (q) above.

 

6.2

 

 _ _All Parties  Activities Until Effective Time_._ Each of Parent,
Acquisition and the Company agrees that, from the date of this Agreement to
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 8 hereof, unless otherwise contemplated herein (for
the avoidance of doubt, this provision is not violated by actions permitted by
this agreement including Section 5.1):

 

(a)

 

Parent shall not (i) take any action that is intended to or would result in
any of the conditions to the Tender Offer or any of the conditions to
effecting the Merger becoming incapable of being satisfied; or (ii) take any
action or fail to take any action which would, or would be reasonably likely
to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the ability of Parent and Acquisition to consummate the Tender Offer,
the ability of the Company and Acquisition to consummate the Merger or the
ability of any of the Company, Parent and Acquisition to complete the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b)

 

Parent will take all actions necessary to (i) cause Acquisition to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (ii) ensure that, prior
to the Effective Time, Acquisition shall not conduct any business or make any
investments other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c)

 

Parent and Company will take all actions necessary to preserve the status of
the Company as a REIT under Section 856 of the Code at and immediately
subsequent to the Effective Time.

 


  

 

13

   

6.3

 

 _ _Communications to Employees of ACM__. The Company and Parent will endeavor
in good faith to agree upon written and oral statements regarding the
Transactions to be made to employees of ACM who are engaged in managing the
Company and its subsidiaries.

 

6.4

 

 _ _Takeover Defenses_._ If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to
the Tender Offer, the Transaction or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition and their
respective boards of directors shall grant all such approvals and take all
such actions as are necessary or appropriate so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable hereafter on the terms contemplated
hereby, and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on
such transactions.

 

6.5

 

 _ _ACM Assistance to Company__. Parent will, except as otherwise instructed
in writing by the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee, cause ACM to do all things in its power to cause the Company to
fulfill all its obligations in this Article 6 and elsewhere in this Agreement.
Without limiting what is said in the preceding sentence, to the extent ACM is
reasonably able to do so, Parent will cause ACM to follow all instructions of
the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, to cause
the Company to take actions or not take actions between the date of this
Agreement and the Expiration Time.

 

6.6

cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable law to fulfill all conditions applicable to such
party pursuant to this Agreement (including, as applicable, Section 7.1 or 7.2
of this Agreement) and to consummate the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Except to the extent that Parent requests otherwise and
waives any resulting failure of a condition to Acquisitions obligation to
purchase the shares of Common Stock tendered in response to the Tender Offer,
the Company and Parent will cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, approvals and
waivers required by third persons so that all permits and contracts of the
Company and its subsidiaries will remain in full force and effect after the
Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Expiration Time and
the Effective Time to occur as promptly as practicable, including by defending
against any lawsuits, actions or proceedings, judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and seeking to have any restraint or prohibition entered
or imposed by any court or other Governmental Authority that is not yet final
and non-appealable vacated or reversed, _provided that_ none of Parent,
Acquisition or the Company (unless Parent agrees to reimburse the Company)
will be required voluntarily to incur or increase any financial obligation in
order to resolve lawsuits, actions or proceedings.

 

ARTICLE 7 
 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO MERGER

 

7.1

 

 _ _Conditions to the Company s Obligations__. The obligations of the Company

(any or all of which, other than the condition in Section 7.1(a), may be
waived by the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee):

 

(a)

 

Shares of Common Stock representing at least the Minimum Condition will have
been validly tendered in response to the Tender Offer and not withdrawn by the
Expiration Time and Acquisition will have purchased all the shares of Common

7.3

 

 _ _Frustration of Closing Conditions__. No party to this Agreement may rely,
either as a basis for not consummating the Merger or terminating this
Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any condition set forth

respect by such partys breach of any provision of this Agreement or failure
to use the efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby that are required by Article 6.

 


  

 

14

   

ARTICLE 8 
 TERMINATION

 

8.1

 

 _ _Right to Terminate__. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time:

 

(a)

 

By mutual written consent of the Company and Parent.

 

(b)

 

By the Company before (but not after) Acquisition accepts for purchase Common
Stock that is tendered in response to the Tender Offer if there has been a
material breach by Parent or Acquisition, as the case may be, of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition
to the Tender Offer set forth on Exhibit 1.2-E, and (ii) has not been waived
by the Company or cured by Parent or Acquisition within fifteen (15) Business
Days after Parents receipt of written notice thereof from the Company or is
incapable of being cured by Parent or Acquisition on or before the Tender
Outside Date.

 

(c)

 

By the Company after Acquisition accepts for purchase Common Stock that is
tendered in response to the Tender Offer but before the Effective Time, as to
the Merger but not the Tender Offer (and without affecting any obligation of
Acquisition to purchase, or any purchase by Acquisition that has taken place
of, Common Stock that is tendered in response to the Tender Offer) if an order
is entered by any Governmental Authority which restrains or otherwise prevents
the Company or Acquisition from completing the Merger, and despite efforts by
the Company to cause that order to be dissolved or modified in a way that
would permit the Merger to take place, because of that order the Merger does
not take place within 120 days after the Expiration Date.

 

(d)

 

By Parent before (but not after) Acquisition accepts for purchase Common Stock
that is tendered in response to the Tender Offer if there has been a material
breach by the Company of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give
rise to the failure of a condition to the Tender Offer set forth on Exhibit
1.2-E, and (ii) has not been waived by Parent or cured by the Company within
fifteen (15) Business Days after the Company receives written notice thereof
from Parent or is incapable of being cured by the Company on or before the
Tender Outside Date ( _provided_ , that the breach or inaccuracy of any such
representation or warranty was not known, or reasonably should have been
known, to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates on or prior to the
date of this Agreement).

 

(e)

 

By the Parent after Acquisition accepts for purchase Common Stock that is
tendered in response to the Tender Offer but before the Effective Time, as to
the Merger but not the Tender Offer (and without affecting any obligation of
Acquisition to purchase, or any purchase by Acquisition that has taken place
of, Common Stock that is tendered in response to the Tender Offer), if an
order is entered by any Governmental Authority which restrains or otherwise
prevents the Company or Acquisition from completing the Merger, and despite
diligent efforts by the Parent and Acquisition to cause that order to be
dissolved or modified in a way that would permit the Merger to take place,
because of that order the Merger does not take place within 120 days after the
Expiration Date.

 

(f)

 

By the Company if before the Expiration Date, (i) the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal to acquire 20% or more of the stock or assets of the
Company, or a Potential Acquiror commences a cash tender offer or an exchange
offer 20% or more of the Company\'s outstanding stock (other than any already
owned by the Potential Acquiror), (ii) the Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee, determines that such Acquisition
Proposal or the tender offer or exchange offer is or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and resolves to accept the
Superior Proposal, or to recommend that stockholders tender their shares in
response to the Superior Proposal, unless Acquisition will increase the Tender
Offer Price and the Merger Price to an amount per share of Common Stock equal
to the value per share of Common Stock of the consideration the Company\'s
stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal, (iii) the
Company has given Parent and Acquisition at least three Business Days prior
notice (a "Superior Proposal Notice") (A) of the terms of the Superior
Proposal (including the value per share of Common Stock of the consideration
the Company\'s stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior
Proposal, valuing non-cash consideration at its fair value as determined by
the Board, after consultation with the Special Committee), and (B) that unless
Acquisition increases the Tender Offer Price and the Merger Price to an amount
per share equal to the value per share of Common Stock of the consideration
the Company\'s stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior
Proposal, as set forth in the Superior Proposal Notice, this Agreement will
terminate, and (iv) Parent has failed to give the Company an irrevocable
notice within the three full Business Day period that Acquisition will
increase the Tender Offer Price and the Merger Price to an amount per share
equal to the value per share of Common Stock of the consideration the
Company\'s stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal, as
set forth in the Superior Proposal Notice (a "Price Increase Notice"). A
"Superior Proposal" is an Acquisition Proposal, a tender offer or an exchange
offer, in each case relating to greater than 50% of the Companys stock or
assets, which the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee determines, after consultation with its legal advisors and
independent financial advisor, is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms and would result in a transaction more favorable to
the Company\'s common stockholders than the Tender Offer and the Merger,
taking into account all material legal, financial and regulatory aspects of
the proposal (including the consideration per share to be received by the
Companys stockholders). A notice that this Agreement will terminate included
in a Superior Proposal Notice will be irrevocable (unless Parent consents in

 


  

 

15

   



 

writing to its being withdrawn by the Company) and, unless Parent gives a
Price Increase Notice within the three Business Days described in clause (iv)
of this Section 8.1(f), will result in this Agreement\'s terminating on the
later of the date specified in the Superior Proposal Notice. If Parent gives
the Company a Price Increase Notice, this Agreement will be deemed amended to
cause the Tender Offer Price to be the price described in the Price Increase
Notice, and the Company will not have the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.1(f) as a result of the Acquisition Proposal described in
the Superior Proposal Notice.

 

(g)

 

By the Company if, after Parent has given the Company a Price Increase Notice
and before the Expiration Date (as it is extended because of the Superior
Proposal Notice or the Price Increase Notice), (i) the Company receives a
subsequent Acquisition Proposal (whether from the same or a different
Potential Acquiror) to acquire 20% or more of the stock or assets of the
Company, or a Potential Acquiror commences a cash tender offer or an exchange
offer for 20% or more of the Company\'s outstanding stock (other than any
already owned by the Potential Acquiror), and (ii) the Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee, determines that the subsequent
Acquisition Proposal or tender offer or exchange offer is a Superior Proposal
even taking into account the amendment to this Agreement as a result of the
Price Increase Notice, and resolves to accept the Superior Proposal, or to
recommend that stockholders tender their shares in response to the Superior
Proposal, _provided_ that the Company will not have the right to terminate
this Agreement as a result of a subsequent Acquisition Proposal or tender
offer or exchange offer that the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee, determines to be a Superior Proposal unless (x) the Company
has given Parent and Acquisition at least two Business Days prior notice of
the terms of the Superior Proposal (including the value per share of Common
Stock of the consideration the Company\'s stockholders would receive as a
result of the Superior Proposal, valuing non-cash consideration at its fair
value as determined by the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee, after consultation with its financial advisers), which two
Business Days notice will for all purposes of this Agreement be a Superior
Proposal Notice (except that it may be revoked at the discretion of the Board,
acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee), and (y) if Parent
asks to discuss with the Special Committee during the two Business Day period
modifying the Tender Offer Price or other terms of this Agreement to make the
Transactions, as modified, as favorable to the Companys common stockholders
as the subsequent Acquisition Proposal or tender offer or exchange offer that
the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, has
determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee, will have engaged in those
discussions and, if Parent has offered to modify the Tender Offer Price or
other terms of this Agreement, at the conclusion of those discussions, the
Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, will have made
a determination that the subsequent Acquisition Proposal or tender offer
continues to be more favorable to the Company\'s common stockholders as the
Transactions as Parent has offered to modify them. If, because of an offer by
Parent to modify the Tender Offer Price or other terms of this Agreement, the
Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, withdraws its
determination that a subsequent Acquisition Proposal or tender offer is a
Superior Proposal and then the Company receives one or more additional
subsequent Acquisition Proposals or there are one or more subsequent tender
offers or exchange offers, the provisions of this Section 8.1(g) will apply to
each of those subsequent Acquisition Proposals or tender offers or exchange
offers.

 

(h)

 

When the Company delivers a Superior Proposal Notice, Acquisition\'s
obligations under Sections 1.2, 2.1 and 6.2(b)(i), will be suspended until
such, if any, time as Parent gives a Price Increase Notice (if the Superior
Proposal Notice is given under Section 8.1(f)), or the Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee, withdraws its determination that a
subsequent Acquisition Proposal or a tender offer or exchange offer
constitutes a Superior Proposal (if the Superior Proposal Notice is given
under Section 8.1(g)).

 

(i)

 

By Parent, if before Acquisition accepts shares that have been tendered in
response to the Tender Offer, (i) the Board, acting upon the recommendation of
the Special Committee, withdraws or materially modifies in a manner adverse to
the Transactions, or recommends that the Board withdraw or materially modify
in a manner adverse to the Transactions, the recommendation that the
stockholders of the Company tender their shares in response to the Tender
Offer or (ii) there is a public statement, for which neither Parent, any
subsidiary of Parent or anyone acting on their behalf is responsible, to the
effect that the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee, intends to withdraw its recommendation or modify it in a manner
adverse to the Transactions and, if requested by Parent, the Company does not
within three full Business Days after the date of the request, with the
approval of the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee, issue and file with the SEC a public statement denying that that is
the case.

 

(j)

 

By either the Company or Parent if (i) the Expiration Date has not occurred by
September 30, 2016 (the "Tender Outside Date") and (ii) the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(j) has not breached in
any material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that
shall have proximately caused or resulted in the failure of the Tender Offer
to have been consummated by such date.

 

8.2

 

 _ _Manner of Terminating Agreement__. If at any time the Company or Parent
has the right under Section 8.1 to terminate this Agreement, except as
specifically provided in Section 8.1, it can terminate this Agreement by a
notice to the other of them that it is terminating this Agreement.

 


  

 

16

   

8.3

 

 _ _Effect of Termination__. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, after this Agreement is terminated, neither party will have any
further rights or obligations under this Agreement. Nothing contained in this
Section will, however, relieve either party of liability or damages for any
fraud or willful misconduct or bad faith resulting in a breach of this
Agreement by such party which occurs before this Agreement is terminated.

 

8.4

 

 _ _Termination Fee; Expenses__.

 

(a)

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Company
be obligated to pay a termination fee.

  

  (b)

 

  If the Company terminates this Agreement as permitted under Section 8.1(f)
or 8.1(g), or if Parent terminates this Agreement as permitted under Section
8.1(i) solely in the event that the Tender Offer is commenced and the Minimum
Condition is not met prior to the Expiration Date, then, within 10 business
days following such termination, the Company will reimburse Parent for all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it or by Acquisition   in connection with
this Agreement in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by it (  including reasonable fees and expenses of
professionals and other consultants and out of pocket costs incurred by
employees in investigating the business and financial condition of the Company
and in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and efforts to carry
out the transactions which are the subject of this Agreement) for which Parent
has presented reasonable documentation to the Company (up to a total
reimbursement of expenses not exceeding $2.0 million).  

 

(c)

 

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Tender Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, except that expenses incurred in connection with the printing and
mailing of any required filings with the SEC and in connection with notices or
other filings with any other Governmental Authority shall be shared equally by
Parent and the Company.

 

ARTICLE 9 
 ABSENCE OF BROKERS

 

9.1

 

 _ _Representations and Warranties Regarding Brokers and Others__. The Company
and Acquisition each represents and warrants that nobody acted as a broker, a
finder or in any similar capacity in connection with the Transactions or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that JMP acted as a
financial advisor to the Special Committee and Lazard Freres and Co. LLC
("Lazard") acted as a financial advisor to Parent and Acquisition. The Company
will pay all the fees and other charges of JMP, and Parent or Acquisition will
pay all the fees and other charges of Lazard.

 

ARTICLE 10 
 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

 

10.1

 

 _ _Indemnification for Prior Acts__. For a period of no less than six years
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, all past and present directors, including, but not
limited to the member of the Special Committee, and officers of the Company
and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any
costs, expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements),
judgments, fines, losses, claims damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or
fiduciary of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or is or was serving at
the request of, or to represent the interest of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, fiduciary,
employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
limited liability company, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
including any charitable or not-for profit public service organization or
trade association whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), and provide advancement of expenses to the Indemnified
Parties, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law as it presently
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent such amendment permits Parent or the Surviving Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights or rights of advancement of expenses
than such Law permitted Parent or the Surviving Corporation to provide prior
to such amendment), (ii) without limitation to clause (i), to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, include and cause to be maintained in
effect in the Surviving Corporations (or any successors) organizational
documents for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time,
provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, and
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors and officers of
the Company, no less favorable than those contained in the Companys
organizational documents as of the date hereof and (iii) not settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or
threatened litigation, action, suit, arbitration, investigation or similar
proceeding (public or private) ("Action"), in each case, by or before a
Governmental Authority (and in which indemnification could be sought by an
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Action or

 


  

 

17

   



 

such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (A) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the
Effective Time, (B) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain his or
her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to
control the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, and (C) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Party, promptly
after statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

The Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect for not less than six years
after Effective Time, with respect to occurrences prior to the Effective Time,
the Company\'s policies of directors and officers\' liability insurance which
are in effect on the date of this Agreement and are listed on _Schedule 10.1_
(notwithstanding any provisions of those policies that they will terminate as
a result of a merger), or provide substantially equivalent coverage and
amounts containing terms no less favorable to such directors or officers, and
from insurance carriers with at least comparable claims paying ability
ratings, to the extent that insurance is available at an annual cost not
exceeding 350% of the annual cost of the policies of directors and officers
liability insurance that are in effect at the date of this Agreement (and, to
the extent that insurance is not available at an annual cost not exceeding
350% of the annual cost of the policies that are in effect at the date of this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect the maximum
coverage that is available for that amount). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
purchase a "tail" insurance policy with a fresh, unimpaired aggregate limit of
liability (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Merger) of at
least the same coverage with a fresh, unimpaired aggregate limit of liability,
and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the
directors and officers of the Company as the Companys existing policy or
policies, and from insurance carriers with at least comparable claims paying
ability ratings, for the benefit of the current and former officers and
directors of the Company with a claims period of six years from the Effective
Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance for claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time.
If the Surviving Corporation is acquired during the period of six years after
the date of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation will require in any
agreement relating to its being acquired that the acquirer shall maintain in
effect the insurance required by this Section.

 

10.2

 

 _ _Benefit of Provisions__. The provisions of Section 10.1 are intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, the respective current and
former directors and officers of the Company or its subsidiaries to which they
relate and their heirs and representatives (all of whom will, for the
avoidance of doubt, be express third party beneficiaries of this Article 10).

 

ARTICLE 11 
 OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT TO FUND ACQUISITION

 

11.1

 

 _ _Funding of Acquisition_._

 

(a)

 

If Acquisition accepts shares of Common Stock tendered in response to the
Tender Offer, Parent will provide to Acquisition (whether by contribution,
loan or otherwise) or arrange for Acquisition to obtain from other sources,
all sums Acquisition needs to pay for the accepted shares of Common Stock. If
the Merger takes place, Parent will provide to Acquisition, or arrange for
Acquisition to obtain from other sources, all sums it needs to pay the Merger
Price and to make any other payments Acquisition is required to make as a
result of the Merger.

 

(b)

 

If Acquisition is required to make any payments under or with regard to this
Agreement, other than payments of the type described in Section 11.1(a),
including any payments Acquisition is required to make because it fails to
fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement, Parent will provide to
Acquisition, or arrange for Acquisition to obtain from other sources, all
funds Acquisition needs to make those payments.

 

ARTICLE 12 
 GENERAL

 

12.1

 

 _ _Expenses__. The Company and Acquisition will each pay its own expenses in
connection with the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement,
including legal fees and disbursements. The Company will pay the expenses of
the Special Committee in connection with the transactions that are the subject
of this Agreement, including the fees of, and reimbursement of expenses
incurred by, its advisors.

 

12.2

 

 _ _Access to Properties, Books and Records__.

 

(a)

 

From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
time this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 8, the Company
will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, give representatives of
Parent and Acquisition, or of any potential lenders or other sources of
financing to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, reasonable
access during normal business hours to all of their respective properties,
books and records and to personnel of ACM who are knowledgeable about the
various aspects of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, provided
that the Company will not be required by this Section to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of
the ACM

 


  

 

18

   



 

employees responsible for managing the Company, or of the Special Committee,
would result in the disclosure of a trade secret of a third party not related
to the Company or ACM, or violate any of the Companys obligations to a third
party not related to the Company or ACM with respect to confidentiality, if
the Company (through the ACM employees responsible for managing the Company)
has used reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the third party to the
inspection or disclosure.

 

(b)

 

Until the Effective Time, Parent and Acquisition each will, and will cause
their respective representatives to, hold all information it receives as a
result of its access to the properties, books, records and personnel of the
Company or its subsidiaries in confidence, except to the extent that
information (i) is or becomes available to the public (other than through a
breach of this Agreement), (ii) becomes available to Parent or Acquisition
from a third party which, insofar as Parent or Acquisition is aware, is not
under an obligation to the Company, or to a subsidiary of the Company, to keep
the information confidential, (iii) was known to Parent, Acquisition or other
of Parents affiliates before it was made available to Parent or Acquisition
or their representatives by the Company or any of its subsidiary (other than
information disclosed to ACM or its employees in the course of ACMs managing
the Company), (iv) otherwise is independently developed by Parent or
Acquisition or their affiliates (other than ACM), (v) Parent reasonably
believes is required to be included in the Offer Documents, the Schedule TO
(including the Offer TO) or (vi) Parent reasonably determines, based on advice
of legal counsel, that Parent is required to disclose in response to legal
process or any Governmental Authority. If this Agreement is terminated before
the Effective Time, Parent and Acquisition each will, at the request of the
Company, deliver to the Company all documents and other material obtained by
Parent or Acquisition from the Company or a subsidiary in connection with the
transactions which are the subject of this Agreement or evidence that that
material has been destroyed by Parent or Acquisition.

 

12.3

 

 _ _Press Releases__. The Company and Parent will consult with each other
before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement, but nothing in this Section will prevent
either party or any affiliate of either party from making any statement or
announcement when and as required by Law or by the rules of any securities
exchange or securities quotation or trading system on which securities of that
party or an affiliate are listed, quoted or traded.

 

12.4

 

 _ _Entire Agreement__. This Agreement and the documents to be delivered in
accordance with this Agreement contain the entire agreement among the Company,
Parent and Acquisition relating to the transactions which are the subject of
this Agreement and those other documents, all prior negotiations,
understandings and agreements between the Company and either Parent or
Acquisition are superseded by this Agreement and those other documents, and
there are no representations, warranties, understandings or agreements
concerning the transactions which are the subject of this Agreement or those
other documents other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement or
those other documents.

 _ _Benefit of Agreement__. This Agreement is for the benefit of the Parties
to it, their respective successors and any permitted assigns. Except as stated
in Section 10.2, this Agreement is not intended to be for the benefit of, or
to give any rights to, anybody other than the Parties, their respective
successors and any permitted assigns.

 

12.6

 

 _ _Effect of Disclosures__. Any information disclosed by a party in
connection with any representation and warranty contained in this Agreement
(including any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement) will be treated as
having been disclosed in connection with each representation and warranty made
by that party in this Agreement.

 

12.7

 

 _ _Captions__. The captions of the articles and sections of this Agreement
are for convenience only, and do not affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 

12.8

 

 _ _Assignments__. Neither this Agreement nor any right of any party under it
may be assigned, except that Acquisition may assign its rights under this
Agreement to a corporation or other entity a majority of the equity of which
is owned by Parent.

 

12.9

 

 _ _Notices and Other Communications__. Any notice or other communication
under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed given when it is

of another partys obligations under this Agreement, without any requirement
that the party obtaining the order post a bond, and the Parties agree that if
any proceeding is brought in equity to compel performance of any provision of
this Agreement, no party will raise the defense that there is an adequate
remedy at law or assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason. The
Parties agree that if specific performance is available and granted with
regard to any breach by any party of any obligation under this Agreement, that
specific performance shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for that breach
unless this Agreement is terminated as permitted under Article 8.

Exhibit 1.2-E

 

Acquisition will not be required to accept for payment or pay for any Common
Stock tendered in response to the Tender Offer if:

 

(a)

 

The number of shares of Common Stock that are properly tendered in response to
the Tender Offer and not withdrawn by the Expiration Time is less than the
Minimum Condition.

 

(b)

 

Any statute, rule or regulation has been enacted or adopted by any
Governmental Authority that would make the acquisition of the tendered Common
Stock by Acquisition or the Merger illegal.

 

(c)

 

Any order has been entered by any Governmental Authority and be in force which
invalidates this Agreement or restrains Acquisition from completing the
acquisition of the tendered Common Stock or from completing the Merger.

 

(d)

 

Any of the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement is
not true and correct on the day the Tender Offer expires with the same effect
as though they were made on that day, except failures to be true and correct
which (i) could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or to have a material adverse effect on
Acquisitions legal ability to purchase or own Common Stock that is tendered
in response to the Tender Offer or Acquisitions legal ability to consummate
the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) were known, or reasonably
should have been known, to Parent or any of its subsidiaries or ACM on or
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(e)

 

The Company has not performed in all material respects all the obligations it
is required to have performed under this Agreement by the Expiration Date,
except failures which (i) do not, and cannot reasonably be expected to, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) have been caused by or result from a
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Acquisition and (iii) (ii) have been
caused or result from the action or failure to act by ACM.

 

(f)

 

This Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

(g)

 

The Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, withdraws
or modifies in a manner adverse to Acquisition the Boards recommendation or

(h)

or modifies in a manner adverse to Acquisition the Boards recommendation that
stockholders accept the Tender Offer.

Parent, and any of those conditions, other than the condition in paragraph
(a), may be waived by Parent in whole or in part. Any delay by Acquisition in
