correct any matter that would constitute a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller in
<U>Article&nbsp;III</U> or <U>Article&nbsp;IV</U>. For purposes of determining whether Buyer&#146;s conditions
set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;8.3</U> have been fulfilled, the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to
include only that information contained therein on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to
exclude all information contained in any supplement or amendment thereto. If Closing occurs, then
any matters disclosed to Buyer pursuant to any supplement or amendment after the Execution Date
and prior to the Closing shall be deemed to be waived by Buyer, and Buyer shall not be entitled to
make a claim thereon under this Agreement (including pursuant to <U>Article&nbsp;XI</U>) or otherwise.
If, however, Buyer is obligated to close and the Closing shall occur, then any matter disclosed to
Buyer pursuant to any supplement or amendment provided by Seller after the Execution Date and
prior to the Closing shall not be deemed to be waived by Buyer, and Buyer shall be entitled to
make a Claim thereon under this Agreement (including pursuant to ARTICLE XI) or otherwise.
Further, if Buyer obtains Knowledge of any matter hereunder prior to the Closing and the Closing
shall occur, any waiver or non-waiver of any related Claim will be handled in the same manner as
such matters are handled with respect to any supplement or amendment to Seller Disclosure Schedule
(<I>e.g.</I>, they will be waived only if Buyer is not obligated (but elects) to close).

calculated, as will the number of days Buyer will own the Shares. Fractions will be calculated in
which the numerators will be the number of days during 2008 that Seller owned the Shares, and the
number of days during 2008 that Buyer will own the Shares, respectively, and the denominators will
be the number of days in year 2008. These fractions will be multiplied by the number of
eligibility hours of vacation entitlement (not including carried over or banked vacation) for
Post-Closing Employees on the Closing Date, whether already taken or not. The resulting calculation
will yield the number of hours of vacation attributable to the account of both Buyer and Seller. To
the extent the total actual remaining vacation entitlement (not including carried over or banked
vacation hours) to be taken in 2008 by Post-Closing Employees is greater than the total number of
vacation hours attributable to Buyer, Seller will pay Buyer the dollar amount of the difference as
an adjustment to Net Working Capital. To the extent that the total actual remaining vacation
entitlement (not including carried over or banked vacation hours) to be taken in 2008 by
Post-Closing Employees is less than the total number of vacation hours attributable to Buyer, Buyer
will pay Seller the dollar amount of the difference as an adjustment to Net Working Capital. This
dollar amount will be calculated by multiplying the total number of vacation hours (by which the

the portion of the Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the closing of business on the Closing Date, and the
amount of property taxes of the Company for the portion of the Straddle Period that relates to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such tax for the entire taxable period,
<I>multiplied </I>by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending
on the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any franchise tax paid or payable with respect to
the Company shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the income, operations, assets or
capital comprising the base of such tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business
for another taxable period is obtained by the payment of such franchise tax.

the income (loss)&nbsp;of the Company to be included in the consolidated federal income Tax Return or
combined or consolidated state and local Tax Returns in which it is a member in accordance with the
relevant Tax Law. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared at the expense of Seller and filed in a
manner consistent with prior practice, except as required by a change in Tax Law or the
interpretation of substantial authority previously relied upon by Seller. Buyer shall cause the

consolidated income Tax Returns, and shall include the income (loss)&nbsp;of the Company in such Tax
Returns attributable to the remaining time in the Straddle Period following the Pre-Closing Tax

Seller, if the Company is required under the relevant Tax Law to pay such Taxes directly to the

the Refinery they will be identified as railcars to be assigned to the Company (&#147;<U>Qualifying

Indemnified Party as a result of the events giving rise to the claim for indemnification, net of
any expenses related to the receipt of such proceeds, including retrospective premium adjustments,
if any. The amount of the indemnity payment shall be computed by taking into account the timing
of the loss or payment, as applicable, at the Applicable Rate from the date the Indemnified Party
provides notice of the Loss to the Indemnifying Party until the date paid. Upon the request of
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with

payment in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;11.5</U>. An Indemnified Party shall take all
reasonable steps to mitigate damages in respect of any claim for which it is seeking
indemnification and shall use reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated with
such claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof;
<U>provided</U>, that an Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to make a claim for recovery
against any insurer of such Indemnified Party with respect to any such Losses.
