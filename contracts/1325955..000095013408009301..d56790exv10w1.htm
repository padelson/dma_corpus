 (a) Subject to _Section 6.4_, during the period prior to the Closing, Seller and the Company shall (i) provide to Buyer and its Diligence Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, and in a manner that will not unreasonably disrupt the operation of the Business, to Sellers and the Companys properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records directly and exclusively related to the Company, the Assets and the operation of Business and (ii) furnish promptly to Buyer, at Buyers expense, a copy of such information concerning the business, properties, assets, liabilities, financial condition, operations, results of operations and personnel of the Company as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request; provided, however, that access to and copies of such information may be limited, if necessary, by applicable Laws. Buyer shall hold, and shall cause its employees, representatives, agents and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information obtained from Seller or the Company in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with the provisions of, the Confidentiality Agreement. Seller shall hold, and shall cause its respective employees, representatives, agents and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information obtained from Buyer in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with the provisions of, the Confidentiality Agreement.

to the public other than as a direct result of the disclosure of any such
information by Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing Date. 

   

 Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall give prompt written notice to the other of (i) any material notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Claim commenced or threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting it, that materially relates to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) any change that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (in the case of the Company), or would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the ability of Seller, the Company or Buyer perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Other Agreements to which it is a party. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Title Matters_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall endeavor to cause the Title Company to issue, within fifteen (15) days after the Execution Date, commitments (the " _Title Commitments_ ") for one or more Title Policies to be issued by the Title Company with respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property together with copies of all instruments identified therein as creating Exceptions. Buyer shall have the right to make objections (" _Title Objections_ ") to any easements, covenants, restrictions, Liens, encumbrances, tenancies and other exceptions identified in the Title Commitments as affecting title to the applicable parcel of Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property (collectively, the " _Exceptions_ "), except for any Exceptions which constitute Permitted Liens, such Title Objections to be made in writing and delivered to Seller and the Title Company within the later of (i) fifteen (15) days following Buyers receipt of the Title Commitments or June 15, 2008. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure (or cause to be cured, including by way of express title insurance or its equivalent) any Exceptions constituting Title Objections, such cure to be effected not later than ten (10) days following Sellers receipt of the Title Objections (the " _Cure Period_ "); provided, however, that in the event a mortgage, deed of trust or other similar monetary lien secured by the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property and placed on the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property by or at the request of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company (collectively a " _Mortgage Lien_ ") affects all or any portion of the Companys interest in the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property, on or before Closing, Seller or the Company shall cause all such Mortgage Liens to be satisfied in a manner which is sufficient to cause them to no longer affect title to the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property, and the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property shall be conveyed free and clear of all such Mortgage Liens, and such Mortgage Liens shall in no event constitute, or be deemed to constitute, a Permitted Lien. If Seller elects not to, fails, or is unable for any other reason to cure any Exceptions constituting Title Objections during the Cure Period, Buyer shall have the right, within five (5) Business Days following the expiration of the Cure Period and as Buyers sole and exclusive remedy in such event, to either (i) waive in writing its Title Objections with respect to such Exceptions, or (ii) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller, in which event Seller shall return the Deposit (together with all interest or earnings thereon) to Buyer within five (5) Business Days of receipt of Buyers notice of termination. If Buyer fails to terminate this Agreement in accordance with clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence within five (5) Business Days 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Execution Copy_  

  

of receipt of Sellers notice described in the immediately preceding sentence,
then Buyer shall be deemed to have waived all Title Objections which have
not, as of such time, been cured, and all Exceptions forming the basis for
such uncured Title Objections shall become Permitted Liens and set forth in
Section 1.1(a) of the Disclosure Schedules. 

   

 (b) Each Title Policy shall insure good and marketable fee simple title to the Owned Real Property and valid and enforceable leasehold interests in the Leased Real Property in the Company for an amount determined by Buyer in its sole but reasonable discretion (subject to any limitations imposed on the Title Company by applicable Law and underwriting requirements) and subject to Permitted Liens and the standard printed exceptions in the promulgated Title Policy form;  _provided_ , that Buyer may cause the Title Company, at Buyers sole cost and expense, to issue any available endorsement or to otherwise limit or cause the removal of such standard printed exceptions. Provided that Seller will not thereby incur any liabilities in excess of those incurred by Seller under this Agreement, Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate with Buyer in executing any documents reasonably requested by the Title Company which may be necessary to issue the Title Policies, including providing any factually true affidavit reasonably requested by the Title Company or Buyer to evidence the payment or satisfaction of any Liens and removal of the standard printed exceptions in the promulgated Title Policy form, to evidence the payment of any Taxes affecting the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property, to certify any of the representations set forth in Section 4.3(a), or to evidence the satisfaction of any other matter which Buyer may be required to establish in order to obtain the Title Policy or any endorsement thereto. 

  

 (c) Seller shall not be obligated to provide any new or updated surveys of any of the Real Property Interests; however, Seller agrees to reasonably cooperate with Buyer and its Diligence Representatives prior to Closing to permit Buyer to attempt to procure one or more aerial photographs of the Refinery on which the boundaries of the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property shall be overlayed together with those easements and other encumbrances reasonably requested by the Buyer which are capable of being located and plotted without setting or specifically locating pins at the Refinery (the " _Surveys_ ") as Buyer deems necessary, all at Buyers sole risk, cost and expense. In the event that this transaction does not close, provided that the Company has received a copy of the Surveys, Seller agrees to reimburse Buyer for the cost of the Surveys. 

  

 (d) Within 45 days following the Execution Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a  _Section 6.8(d)_ of the Disclosure Schedules which shall set forth to the Knowledge of Seller a list of the pipeline easements, rights of way, servitudes and licenses which the Company or any Affiliate of the Company owns and which serve the Refinery, provided however, Seller makes no representation that the list of the pipeline easements, rights of way, servitudes and licenses will be without gaps or defects based on the lack of a survey.

 Section 6.10 _Supplement to Disclosure Schedules_. Seller may from time to time prior to the Closing, by written notice to Buyer, supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules to correct any matter that would constitute a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller in  _Article III_ or _Article IV_. For purposes of determining whether Buyers conditions set forth in _Section 8.3_ have been fulfilled, the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein on the Execution Date and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained in any supplement or amendment thereto. If Closing occurs, then any matters disclosed to Buyer pursuant to any supplement or amendment after the Execution Date and prior to the Closing shall be deemed to be waived by Buyer, and Buyer shall not be entitled to make a claim thereon under this Agreement (including pursuant to _Article XI_) or otherwise. If, however, Buyer is obligated to close and the Closing shall occur, then any matter disclosed to Buyer pursuant to any supplement or amendment provided by Seller after the Execution Date and prior to the Closing shall not be deemed to be waived by Buyer, and Buyer shall be entitled to make a Claim thereon under this Agreement (including pursuant to ARTICLE XI) or otherwise. Further, if Buyer obtains Knowledge of any matter hereunder prior to the Closing and the Closing shall occur, any waiver or non-waiver of any related Claim will be handled in the same manner as such matters are handled with respect to any supplement or amendment to Seller Disclosure Schedule ( _e.g._ , they will be waived only if Buyer is not obligated (but elects) to close). 

  

 6.11 _Finalization of Certain Other Agreements_. From the Execution Date, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate diligently and in a commercially reasonable manner in order to agree, prior to Closing, upon final versions of (i) Exhibit A to the Transition Services Agreement, (ii) the schedules to the Offtake Agreement, (iii) Part II of the Feedstock and Product Inventory Sales 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Execution Copy_  

   

 Agreement, and (iv) the Crude Supply Agreement. Seller and Buyer agree that such final versions shall be substantially consistent with the versions attached hereto. 

  

 6.12 _Finalization of Lender Document_. Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer and Buyers lenders in a commercially reasonable manner to finalize a form of agreement among Seller and such lenders in substantially the form set forth in _Section 6.12_ of the Disclosure Schedules, it being understood that Seller shall not be required to agree to any deviations from such form other than those necessary to correctly describe the lender parties, the loan transactions and any other factual matters recited therein. 

  

 6.13 _Recordation of Environmental Agreement_. Prior to Closing Seller shall prepare and record a memorandum of the Environmental Agreement (or such other instrument as may be necessary and appropriate based upon the advice of Sellers Louisiana counsel) (the " _Environmental Agreement Declaration_ ") in the appropriate public records of St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, the sole purposes of which shall be to (i) provide public notice of the existence of the Environmental Agreement, and (ii) make the Environmental Agreement a covenant running with the title to the Owned Real Property, such that all obligations of the Company thereunder become binding upon all owners of the Owned Real Property and other persons having any interest therein and enforceable by Valero and its successors ands assigns. Seller agrees to provide a copy of the Environmental Agreement Declaration to Buyer for Buyers review prior to recording and to cooperate with Buyer to incorporate any changes reasonably requested by Buyer prior to recording, but if Seller and Buyer are unable to agree on any changes, Seller shall nevertheless have the right to record the Environmental Agreement Declaration prior to Closing so long as the version recorded has no other purposes and effects no other changes to the Environmental Agreement other than those set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first sentence of this _Section 6.13_. 

  

ARTICLE VII 
 POST-CLOSING COVENANTS; TAX AND EMPLOYEE MATTERS 

   

 Section 7.1 _Retention of Employees_. 

  

 (a) _Continued Employment_.

Any such Short-Term Employee who then becomes eligible for long-term disability benefits provided by Seller as contemplated in the foregoing sentence shall in no event be considered an Employee of the Seller after Closing and shall not otherwise 

   #####

be eligible for any other benefits offered to eligible employees of Seller
after the Closing. Moreover, such individual shall not be considered a Long-
Term Inactive Employee as defined herein. 

   

 (iii) _Long-Term Inactive Employees_. Buyer shall cause the Company to re-employ each Long-Term Inactive Employee on the date such employee is able to return to work, provided such return to work is within twelve (12) months of the initial date of disability. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, upon re-employment, each such employee shall be considered a Post-Closing Employee for all purposes herein and shall no longer be considered a Long-Term Inactive Employee. 

  

 (iv) The provisions of this _Section 7.1(a)_ do not create any new or additional right or expectation of continued employment for Employees.

 (c) _Orderly Transition_. Each Employee who continues employment with the Company after the Closing as described above is referred to herein as a " _Post-Closing Employee_ ". 

  

 (d) _Employment Terms Assurances_. Buyer shall cause benefits to be provided to the Post-Closing Employees (as a group) for a period of at least 12 months beginning on the Closing Date (unless earlier terminated for cause) pursuant to employee benefit plans maintained or to be established by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer as of the Closing Date or as of the expiration of the transition period as contemplated under the Transition Services Agreement, as applicable (" _Buyer s Plans_"). The terms of the Buyers Plans, as well as the compensation terms applicable to such Post-Closing Employees (as a group), shall be, in the aggregate, reasonably comparable to those offered by the Company, Seller or Sellers Affiliates, as applicable, to such Post-Closing Employees prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (e) _Retention Bonuses_. In connection with Sellers sale of the Shares to Buyer, Seller has agreed to make retention bonus payments to certain Employees who are eligible on the scheduled payment dates. _Section 7.1(e)_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth (A) a list of the Employees who will be eligible for retention bonuses if they are still employed on the Closing Date, (B) the requirements such Employees must meet in order to maintain eligibility, (C) bonus payment amounts (expressed as a percentage of salary) and (D) a payment schedule for bonus payment installments.

Seller shall reimburse Buyer (or the Company, if requested by Buyer) for such payments to such Employees in accordance with the provisions set forth below. 

  

 (iii) With respect to the post-Closing retention bonus payments, Seller shall: 

   

(1) provide Buyer (or the Company) with a list of the eligible Employees with
their name, social security number, normal base salary in effect on the
Closing Date, and the amount of the remaining payment of such retention
bonuses;

as requested by Buyer) for the estimated payments no later than one day prior
to disbursement by Buyer (or the Company) to the eligible Employees; and 

   

(3) reimburse Buyer (or the Company, as requested by Buyer) for

eligible Employees with the second installment payment:
"Retention installment is funded by Valero." 

  

 Section 7.2 _Service Recognition for Post-Closing Employees_. Except as provided in this _Section 7.2_, Buyer shall ensure that all of Buyers Plans in which the Post-Closing Employees participate after the Closing recognize the years of service with the Company and/or its Affiliates and predecessor employers prior to the Closing of any such Post-Closing Employees (such past service as reflected in the employment data furnished to Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.1_ ) for eligibility and vesting purposes to the same extent as such Post-Closing Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Sellers Plans, but Buyer shall have no obligation to recognize such years of service for benefit accrual purposes. 

  

 Section 7.3 _Pension Plan Coverage_. 

  

 (a) On and after the Closing, Post-Closing Employees shall become participants in a tax-qualified pension plan maintained or to be established by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer as of the Closing Date (" _Buyer s Pension_") with full credit for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for benefit accrual) for service with the Company and/or its Affiliates and predecessor employers prior to the Closing as provided for in _Section 7.2_. As of the Closing Date, Post-Closing Employees who are participants in the Valero Energy Corporation Pension Plan (" _Seller s Pension Plan_") shall be fully vested in their accrued benefits under Sellers Pension Plan. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall permit each Post-Closing Employee to elect on the Closing Date (or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable) a direct rollover of his or her eligible rollover distributions under the Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan (" _Seller s Savings Plan_") to a tax-qualified deferred contribution plan maintained or to be established by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer as of the Closing Date (the " _Buyer s Savings Plan_"). Any such rollovers shall be made to the Buyers Savings Plan in cash or plan loans. Seller represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the Sellers Savings Plan, and Buyer represents, covenants and agrees with respect to the Buyers Savings Plan, that, as of each date of a rollover described in this paragraph, such plan (i) is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a) and (k) of the Code and (ii) will have received, or an application will be timely filed for, a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service regarding such qualified status. Buyer will have no obligation with respect to amounts attributable to Sellers Savings Plan other than acceptance of the rollovers requested by Post-Closing Employees. Seller shall take (or shall cause its Affiliates to take) any action required to ensure that Post-Closing Employees who are participants in the Sellers Savings Plan shall be fully vested in their accounts in the Sellers Savings Plan. 

  

 Section 7.4 _Welfare Plan Coverage_. 

  

 (a) With respect to each Post-Closing Employee who elects to participate in Buyers Welfare Plans following the transition period as contemplated under the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall, to the extent allowed under Buyers Welfare Plans, waive any 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Execution Copy_  

  

pre-existing condition exclusions to coverage, any evidence of insurability
provisions, any active at work requirement and any waiting period or service
requirements that did not exist or had been waived or otherwise satisfied
under Sellers Welfare Plans, provided the Post-Closing Employee enrolls
within a reasonable period of time after first becoming eligible to enroll. 

   

 (b) Post-Closing Employees shall be eligible to continue to participate in Sellers flexible spending plan (" _Seller s FSP_") following the Closing as contemplated under the Transition Services Agreement. Thereafter, Buyer shall establish a flexible spending plan or allow Post-Closing Employees to participate in an existing flexible spending plan (" _Buyer s FSP_") and Buyer and Seller agree to determine appropriate transition strategy for outstanding balances held by Post-Closing Employees under Sellers FSP and the reimbursement of claims thereunder to the extent necessary. 

  

 Section 7.5 _Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits_. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance (" _Retiree Welfare Benefit_ ") coverage for any Employees or eligible former employees who do not become Post-Closing Employees. 

  

 Section 7.6 _Other Benefits_. 

  

 (a) Buyer shall cause the Company to honor the Post-Closing Employees accrued vacation entitlement, except for any carry over or banked amount. Promptly following the Closing Date, Seller shall pay Post-Closing Employees for vacation the Post-Closing Employees have carried over or banked from prior years up to and including the Closing Date. At the beginning of the calendar year next succeeding the Closing Date (i.e., calendar 2009), Post-Closing Employees shall be covered by Buyers vacation schedule going forward but with recognition of past service to determine vacation entitlement levels. Within 30 days after the Closing, Seller will provide to Buyer a list of the accrued vacation entitlement for the Post-Closing Employees. Within 30 days after the Closing Date, year 2008 earned and accrued vacation liabilities of Post-Closing Employees will be calculated as follows: the days during 2008 that Seller owned the Shares will be calculated, as will the number of days Buyer will own the Shares. Fractions will be calculated in which the numerators will be the number of days during 2008 that Seller owned the Shares, and the number of days during 2008 that Buyer will own the Shares, respectively, and the denominators will be the number of days in year 2008. These fractions will be multiplied by the number of eligibility hours of vacation entitlement (not including carried over or banked vacation) for Post-Closing Employees on the Closing Date, whether already taken or not. The resulting calculation will yield the number of hours of vacation attributable to the account of both Buyer and Seller. To the extent the total actual remaining vacation entitlement (not including carried over or banked vacation hours) to be taken in 2008 by Post-Closing Employees is greater than the total number of vacation hours attributable to Buyer, Seller will pay Buyer the dollar amount of the difference as an adjustment to Net Working Capital. To the extent that the total actual remaining vacation entitlement (not including carried over or banked vacation hours) to be taken in 2008 by Post-Closing Employees is less than the total number of vacation hours attributable to Buyer, Buyer will pay Seller the dollar amount of the difference as an adjustment to Net Working Capital. This dollar amount will be calculated by multiplying the total number of vacation hours (by which the total actual remaining vacation entitlement less carried over or banked vacation hours to be taken in 2008 exceeds (or is less 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Execution Copy_  

  

than) the total number of vacation hours attributable to Buyer or Seller in
2008) by the average hourly rate (based on an individual-by-individual rate
analysis) or the average staff employee rate (based on an individual-by-
individual rate analysis). 

   

 (b) Seller agrees to (or shall cause its Affiliates to agree to) (i) fully vest any stock options and shares of restricted stock granted to Post-Closing Employees who would otherwise forfeit those awards as a result of this transaction under the Valero Energy Corporation 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and the 1997 Stock Option Plan, and (ii) permit all such options to be exercised for one year following the Closing Date, except to the extent the option expires earlier. 

  

 (c) Seller agrees to pay (or cause its Affiliates to pay) to eligible Post-Closing Employees at the time of Closing a pro rata portion of any bonuses payable for 2008 based on the number of days prior to the Closing that the Post-Closing Employees were covered under Valeros bonus plan, such payments to be based on targeted bonus amounts for such employees under Valeros bonus plan. 

  

 (d) Buyer agrees to reimburse Post-Closing Employees for tuition payments incurred by such Employees after the Closing for courses that began before the Closing, but only if such courses qualified for reimbursement under Sellers Educational Assistance plan. 

  

 Section 7.7 _Liabilities and Indemnities_. 

  

 (a) _Post-Closing Severance_. Until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide severance in accordance with _Section 7.7(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedules for Post-Closing Employees terminated by the Company or any of its Affiliates (other than terminations for cause). Buyer and the Company shall be responsible for, and Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from and against all Losses arising out of the notification or other requirements of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (the " _WARN Act_ "), with respect to Post-Closing Employees after the Closing. However, Seller shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and against all Losses arising out of the notification or other requirements of the WARN Act with respect to Employees who do not become Post-Closing Employees, whether or not the termination occurs prior to, on, or after the Closing. 

  

 (b) _Workers  Compensation_. Seller shall be responsible for workers compensation claims with respect to any Post-Closing Employee if the incident or alleged incident giving rise to the claim occurred at or prior to the Closing. Buyer and the Company shall be responsible for any workers compensation claims with respect to any Post-Closing Employee if the incident or alleged incident giving rise to the claim occurs after the Closing. In the event of doubt as to the date of the occurrence of the incident or alleged incident, Buyer shall process the claim. With respect to all workers compensation or similar claims (hereinafter " _Compensation Claims_ ") filed with an appropriate agency by or on behalf of any Post-Closing Employee (such employees are, for purposes of this paragraph, hereinafter collectively referred to as " _Claiming Employee_ "), or by the spouse, dependent(s) or personal representative of such Claiming Employee which is first filed after the Closing, (i) Seller shall process, defend and be responsible for, and shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and against any such

Compensation Claim if the incident or alleged incident giving rise to the
claim is alleged to have occurred on or prior to the Closing, (ii) Buyer
shall process, defend and be responsible for, and shall indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees from and against any such Compensation Claim if the incident or
alleged incident giving rise to the claim is alleged to have occurred
subsequent to the Closing, and (iii) in the event any such Compensation Claim
is filed after the Closing and the incident or alleged incident giving rise
to the claim is alleged to have occurred both prior and subsequent to the
Closing, Buyer shall, in consultation with Seller and taking into
account Sellers reasonable suggestions, process such claim (and Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for its allocable portion of the reasonable cost of defense),
and the liability for such claim as between the parties shall be based upon
the length of exposure to such incident or alleged incident while employed by
the Company before and after the Closing. Thus, as between the parties,
the proportionate share of liability shall equal a fraction the denominator
of which shall be the Claiming Employees total length of exposure to such
incident or alleged incident, and the numerator of which shall be in the case
of Buyer, the Claiming Employees total length of exposure while employed
after the Closing, and in the case of Seller, the Claiming Employees total
length of exposure while employed prior to the Closing. 

   

 Section 7.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of _Section 7.1_ through _Section 7.7_ shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person, including any employee or former employee (and any beneficiaries, dependents or representatives thereof) of the Company, Seller or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, and no provision of _Section 7.1_ through _Section 7.7_ shall create such third-party beneficiary rights in any Person in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Buyer or its Affiliates, and nothing herein shall be construed an amendment to any employee benefit plan or arrangement. 

  

 Section 7.9 _Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Seller and Buyer acknowledge that Seller participates in a program of property and liability insurance coverage for itself and its Affiliates. This program has been designed to achieve a coordinated risk-management package for Seller and all of its Affiliates. The program consists of various types of policies including: (a) policies issued to Seller or its predecessors; (b) policies issued directly to Affiliates by one of Sellers wholly-owned insurance companies (" _Seller Captive Insurers_ "); and (c) policies issued to Affiliates by one of the Seller Captive Insurers that may or may not be reinsured by third party insurers; and (d) policies issued under a fronting arrangement policy (or its equivalent) by third party insurers that may or may not be reinsured (including through a guarantee, indemnity, letter of credit or similar undertaking) by Valero or its Affiliates. All of the insurance policies through which the program of coverage is presently or has previously been provided by or to Seller, its predecessors or Affiliates (including the Company) are herein referred to collectively as the " _Seller Policies_." It is understood and agreed by Buyer that from and after the Closing: 

  

 (i) No insurance coverage shall be provided under the Seller Policies to Buyer or the Company; 

  

 (ii) Any and all policies insured or reinsured by any of the Seller Captive Insurers which, but for this provision, would have insured the Refinery shall be deemed 

   #####

terminated, commuted and cancelled ab initio as to the Refinery, the Business,
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company), but without prejudice to
Sellers and its Affiliates rights thereunder; and 

   

 (iii) No claims regarding any matter whatsoever, whether or not arising from events occurring prior to the Closing, shall be made by Buyer or the Company against or with respect to any of the Seller Policies, regardless of their date of issuance. 

  

 (b) Buyer shall procure, pay for and maintain in effect its own policies of insurance with respect to the Business and the Refinery and shall indemnify and defend Seller and its Affiliates against, and shall hold them harmless from, any Losses arising out of claims made after the Closing against any of the Seller Policies by the Company, Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any Person claiming to be subrogated to Buyers or any of its Affiliates rights. Such indemnity shall cover, without limitation, any claim by an insurer for reinsurance, retrospective premium payments, prospective premium increases or any other restitution or funding requirements attributable to any such claim or policy requirements. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.9_, prior to Closing, Seller shall procure, at Sellers expense, a Pollution Legal Liability Policy, similar to the AIG Environmental Specimen Policy set forth in _Section 7._9 of the Disclosure Schedules, naming Company and Buyer as the named insureds and providing $25 million in coverage, subject to a $1 million self-insured retention (assumed by Company and Buyer), with a policy period of 10 years. Coverage grants that will be procured will be similar to the following coverages on the specimen policy, "Coverage A  On-site Clean-up of Pre-Existing Conditions", "Coverage C  Third-Party Claims for On-site Bodily Injury and Property Damage", "Coverage D  Third-Party Claims for Off-site Clean-up Resulting from Pre-Existing Conditions", and "Coverage F  Third-Party Claims for Off-site Bodily Injury and Property Damage". Company and Buyer shall waive all rights of subrogation against Seller and its Affiliates under such policy, and such policy shall not constitute one of the Seller Policies. 

  

 Section 7.10 _Specified Litigation_. With respect to any Retained Litigation the outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the Company, the Business, the Assets or Buyer (" _Specified Litigation_ "), Seller will respond in good faith to Buyers reasonable requests for information or consultation with respect thereto. Seller will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any Specified Litigation without the prior written consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld) if the judgment or proposed settlement would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the Company or Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any Specified Litigation without Buyers consent if the sole relief provided in any such entry of judgment or settlement is monetary damages that are paid in full by Seller. Buyer will respond in good faith to Sellers reasonable requests for information and consultation with respect to Retained Litigation, and Buyer will cause the Company to promptly join in the execution of any settlement agreements or similar documentation related to Retained Litigation reasonably requested by Seller, on the condition that such execution will not result in a waiver by Buyer of any of Sellers indemnification obligations under _Section 11.2_ of this Agreement.

 Section 7.11 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes (other than property taxes) of the Company for the portion of the Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the closing of business on the Closing Date, and the amount of property taxes of the Company for the portion of the Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such tax for the entire taxable period,  _multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any franchise tax paid or payable with respect to the Company shall be allocated to the taxable period during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for another taxable period is obtained by the payment of such franchise tax. 

  

 (b) For all taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and file separate state and local Tax Returns for the Company in jurisdictions requiring separate reporting from the Company and shall cause the income (loss) of the Company to be included in such Tax Returns in accordance with the relevant Tax Law, and Seller or Sellers Affiliate shall cause the income (loss) of the Company to be included in the consolidated federal income Tax Return or combined or consolidated state and local Tax Returns in which it is a member in accordance with the relevant Tax Law. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared at the expense of Seller and filed in a manner consistent with prior practice, except as required by a change in Tax Law or the interpretation of substantial authority previously relied upon by Seller. Buyer shall cause the Company to file all other separate Tax Returns, or shall include the Company in its combined or consolidated income Tax Returns, and shall include the income (loss) of the Company in such Tax Returns attributable to the remaining time in the Straddle Period following the Pre-Closing Tax Period, in accordance with the relevant Tax Law. 

  

 (c) Seller shall assume and be liable for, and shall pay to the relevant Taxing Authority when due, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees from and against, all Taxes of the Company to the extent relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and all Taxes of any member of a Relevant Group or any other Tax of a person other than the Company for which the Company is liable for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, by agreement or otherwise; _provided_ that, as a convenience to Seller, if the Company is required under the relevant Tax Law to pay such Taxes directly to the relevant Taxing Authority, Seller shall pay an amount equal to such Taxes directly to the Company not less than 10 days before such Taxes are due, and Buyer shall cause the Company to pay such Taxes on a timely basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) any estimated property taxes with respect to the Assets or the Company with respect to the portion of the Straddle Period relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be included in Current Liabilities and reflected in the calculation of Net Working Capital, and Buyer shall cause the Company to pay, and shall be liable and responsible for the payment of, such property taxes to the relevant Taxing Authority, (B) if the actual amount of such property taxes for the period identified in (A) above is determined to be greater than the amount included in Current Liabilities and reflected in the calculation of Net Working Capital, Seller shall be liable and responsible for the amount of such deficiency, and (C) if the actual amount of such property 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Execution Copy_  

  

taxes is determined to be less than the amount included in Current Liabilities
and reflected in the calculation of Net Working Capital, Buyer shall be
liable and responsible for causing the Company to return to Seller the amount
of such excess. Buyer shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against, any Taxes imposed on
or incurred by the Company or any of its Affiliates attributable to any
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date, and the portion, determined
as described in _Section 7.11(a)_, of the Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand (the " _Tax Indemnified Person_ "), shall notify the chief tax officer (or other appropriate person) of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be (the " _Tax Indemnifying Person_ "), in writing within ten (10) days of receipt by the Tax Indemnified Person of written notice of any pending or threatened audits, adjustments, claims, examinations, assessments or other proceedings (a " _Tax Audit_ ") which are likely to affect the liability for Taxes of such other party and shall thereafter keep the Tax Indemnified Person reasonably informed about the progress of such Tax Audit and consult in good faith with such person concerning strategic decisions with respect to such Tax Audit to the extent such decisions could affect such person. If the Tax Indemnified Person fails to give such timely notice to the other party, it shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit to the extent such failure to give timely notice adversely affects the other partys right to participate in the Tax Audit. 

  

 If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date or for any Taxes for which only Seller would be liable to indemnify Buyer under this Agreement, Seller shall have the option, at its expense, to control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit. If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date or for any Taxes for which only Buyer would be liable under this Agreement, Buyer shall, at its expense, control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit to the extent that such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which Buyer or the Company is liable. 

  

 If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for which both Seller and Buyer could be liable under this Agreement, to the extent practicable, such Tax items will be distinguished and each party will have the option to control the defense and settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable. If such Tax Audit relates to a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date and any Tax item cannot be identified as being a liability of only one party or cannot be separated from a Tax item for which the other party is liable, Seller, at its expense, shall have the option to control the defense and settlement of the Tax Audit, _provided_ that such party defends the items as reported on the relevant Tax Return and _provided_   _further_ that no such matter shall be settled without the written consent of both Buyer and Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 Any party whose liability for Taxes may be affected by a Tax Audit shall be entitled to participate at its expense in such defense and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense and shall have the right to consent to any settlement of such Tax Audit (not to be unreasonably withheld) to the extent that such settlement would have an adverse effect with respect to a period for which that party is liable for Taxes, under this Agreement or otherwise.

 (e) Buyer shall not and shall not permit its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, including the Company, to take any action on or after the Closing Date which could increase any Sellers liability for Taxes (including any liability of Seller to indemnify Buyer for Taxes under this Agreement) provided, however, that this _Section 7.11(e)_ shall not apply to any such action to which Seller has consented in writing (which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of Seller), or with respect to which Buyer and Seller determine jointly (after consultation in good faith) such action to be required by Law. 

  

 (f) Buyer agrees to pay to Seller any refund received (whether by payment, credit, offset or otherwise, and together with any interest thereon) after the Closing by Buyer or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, including the Company, in respect of any Taxes for which Seller is liable or required to indemnify Buyer. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller and Sellers Affiliates, at Sellers expense, in order to take all necessary steps to claim any such refund. Any such refund received by Buyer or its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or the Company shall be paid to Seller within thirty (30) days after such refund is received. Buyer agrees to notify Seller within ten (10) days following the discovery of a right to claim any such refund and upon receipt of any such refund. Buyer agrees to claim any such refund as soon as possible after the discovery of a right to claim a refund and to furnish to Seller, at Sellers expense, all information, records and assistance reasonably necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment. 

  

 (g) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 7.11_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Seller agrees, and Buyer agrees to cause the Company (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertaining to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, on receipt of such notice, if the other party so requests, Seller shall, or Buyer shall cause the Company to, allow the other party to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). Buyer and Seller further agree upon request, to provide the other party with all information that either party may be required to report pursuant to Code Section 6043 and all Treasury Regulations thereunder. 

  

 (h) All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 (i) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of the sale of the Shares and the transactions contemplated by the Feedstock and Product Inventory Sales Agreement shall be paid by Buyer when due, and Buyer will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documents with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by Law, Seller will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. 

  

 (j) Buyer shall make, and Seller shall join Buyer in making, an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign tax law) (collectively, a " _338(h)(10) Election_ ") with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares hereunder. Buyer shall take (or cause to be taken) all necessary and appropriate actions to effect and preserve a timely 338(h)(10) Election. Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all forms and documentation required in connection with the 338(h)(10) Election and shall provide Seller with a draft Form 8023 (or other like form) for review and execution a reasonable time before the deadline for filing such form. Seller agrees to execute and timely deliver to Buyer any such properly completed forms for filing by Buyer. The parties hereto shall cooperate fully with each other and make available to each other such Tax data and other information as may be reasonably required by Buyer or Seller in order to timely file the 338(h)(10) Election. 

  

 (k) The parties shall reasonably cooperate in allocating the Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Company (plus other relevant items or consideration properly includible in the deemed sales price for Tax purposes) to the assets of the Company for all purposes (including Tax and, to the extent possible under GAAP, financial accounting purposes) immediately following completion of the Net Working Capital Payment as reasonably determined by the parties based upon the methodology specified in the Code (including Section 338 and Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury Regulations) for purposes of the Section 338(h)(10) Election and any valuations Buyer may obtain from a third party, upon which the parties wish to rely. Buyer shall make the initial allocation described in this _Section 7.11(k)_ and supply Seller with such allocation, and any documentation underlying such allocation if requested by Seller. Buyer shall prepare Form 8883 (and any form similar to such form under state or local law) for potential inclusion with the federal income (or state or local) Tax Return of the Company (or the consolidated or combined Tax Returns of which the Company, Buyer and Seller are members). Buyer, the Company and Seller, if Seller agrees with the allocation, shall file all Tax Returns and information reports in a manner consistent with such allocation and shall not take any position or action inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax Return; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, in any audit of any Tax Return of Seller, the Company or Buyer by a taxing authority, the fair market values are finally determined to be different from the Form 8883, as adjusted, Buyer, the Company and Seller may (but shall not be obligated to) take any position or action consistent with the fair market values as finally determined in such audit. 

  

 (l) Buyer and Seller agree that indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including any payment under this _Section 7.11_, shall be treated as Purchase Price adjustments for Tax purposes. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this _Section 7.11_ and any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 7.11_ shall control.

 Section 7.12 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) To the extent not prohibited by Law, for a period of 12 months after the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, hire, employ or engage, or seek to hire, employ or engage, any employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of Seller; _provided_ , that the provisions of this _Section 7.12(a)_ shall not apply to general solicitations not specifically targeted towards such employees, nor shall they apply to Post-Closing Employees. 

  

 (b) To the extent not prohibited by Law, for a period of 12 months after the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, hire, employ or engage, or seek to hire, employ or engage, any employee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including the Post-Closing Employees, without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of Buyer; _provided_ , that the provisions of this _Section 7.12(b)_ shall not apply to general solicitations not specifically targeted towards such employees. 

  

 Section 7.13 _Rail Cars_. 

  

 (a) Seller agrees to transfer or cause its Affiliates to transfer 20 pressure tank railcars (used for LPG transport) to the Company. This represents the approximate number of such railcars currently used in connection with the normal operation of the Assets and the Business. These railcars are leased by Affiliates of the Company pursuant to various rail car leases and agreements with respect thereto (" _Rail Car Agreements_ "). 

  

 (b) Beginning promptly after Closing, Sellers Transportation group will coordinate with a Company representative designated by Buyer to schedule railcars from Sellers or its Affiliates fleet into the Refinery as needed in the ordinary course of business, and as such cars come into the Refinery they will be identified as railcars to be assigned to the Company (" _Qualifying Rail Cars_ "), until such time as 20 such Qualifying Rail Cars have been identified. Only railcars that are in serviceable condition when they arrive at the Refinery will be used as Qualifying Rail Cars. As Qualifying Rail Cars are identified, Seller or its appropriate Affiliate and Buyer shall deliver to the counterparty of each Rail Car Agreement covering such Qualifying Rail Cars a letter: (i) requesting the release of such Qualifying Rail Cars under the applicable Rail Car Agreement, and (ii) the further lease by such counterparty to the Company of such Qualifying Rail Cars. Once a Qualifying Rail Car becomes fully assigned to the Company, it will become a " _Company Rail Car_ ". 

  

 (c) Until such time as the parties complete the paperwork and secure the necessary counterparty consents to complete the assignment of the Qualifying Rail Cars to the Company, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, allow the Company to use the Qualifying Rail Cars on a temporary subleased basis (the " _Loaned Cars_ ") such that, at any time, the total number and types of Company Rail Cars and Loaned Cars equals the number and types identified as Qualifying Rail Cars. Buyer shall cause the Company to reimburse Seller for all lease payments and other associated costs, payments or fees (including repair and maintenance costs) arising under the applicable Rail Car Agreements with respect to the use by the Company of the related Loaned Cars. Buyer may elect to discontinue the use of any Loaned Car by written notice to Seller, in which case, upon return of such Loaned Car to Seller, Buyer shall no longer 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Execution Copy_  

  

be responsible for any payments, costs or fees related thereto, and Seller
shall not be responsible for providing a replacement Loaned Car. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that Seller may substitute other equivalent rail cars
for Loaned Cars, so long as the substituted rail cars meet the criteria to be
Qualifying Rail Cars. The parties hereto agree to (or to cause their
applicable Affiliates to) work together in a commercially reasonable manner
to manage the transition of the Loaned Cars hereunder. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Sellers sole obligations under this Agreement with respect to Third Person Consents necessary for the assignment to the Company of the Qualifying Rail Cars shall be the delivery by Seller to the counterparties thereto of the letters described in _Section 7.13(b)_ above and Sellers joinder in the execution of any documentation reasonably and customarily required by the counterparties to effectuate or otherwise document such assignments. Buyer shall be obligated to negotiate with the lessors of such Rail Car Agreements or Qualifying Rail Cars in a commercially reasonable manner in an effort to enter into leases covering the Qualifying Rail Cars as soon as possible following Closing. Buyer and Seller shall cooperatively endeavor to complete the assignment of all Qualifying Rail Cars (including any substitutes therefor made in accordance with the provisions of _Section 7.13(b)_) as promptly as reasonably possible after Closing, but in all events within 12 months after Closing. Seller shall not be obligated to provide any Loaned Cars more than 12 months following Closing, unless and only to the extent that Buyers failure to complete the assignment of all Qualifying Railcars (and substitutes therefor, as applicable) is the result of Sellers failure to comply with its obligations under this _Section 7.13_. 

  

 (e) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees against any and all Losses arising from the use or misuse after the Closing by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) of the Loaned Cars pursuant to this _Section 7.13_. 

  

 Section 7.14 _Third Person Consents Not Obtained at or Before Closing_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Seller Contract or any benefit arising under or resulting from such Seller Contract if an attempted assignment thereof, without a required Third Person Consent or Authorization, would constitute a breach of such Seller Contract or other contravention of the rights of such third party, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement concerning such Seller Contract, would violate or otherwise is not permitted by Law or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Seller or, upon transfer, of the Company under or in respect of such Seller Contract. If any transfer or assignment by Seller to, or any assumption by the Company of, any interest in, or obligation under, any Seller Contract, requires any Third Person Consent or Authorization, then no such assignment or assumption shall be made without such Third Person Consent or Authorization being obtained. To the extent any Seller Contract may not be assigned to the Company by reason of the absence of any such Third Person Consent or Authorization, the Company shall not be required to assume any obligations arising under such Seller Contract;  _provided_ , _however_ , that upon the receipt of any such Third Person Consent or Authorization after the Closing, such Seller Contract shall be assigned to the Company and the Company shall assume such Seller Contract. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Execution Copy_  

   

 (b) If any such Third Person Consent or Authorization is not obtained prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, to the extent not prohibited by the terms of any applicable Seller Contract or Law and until the receipt of such Third Person Consent or Authorization, hold the Seller Contract, subject to such Third Person Consent or Authorization, together with any proceeds therefrom, in trust for the Company, and Seller and the Company shall cooperate (each at its own expense) in any mutually acceptable, lawful and reasonable arrangement under which the Company shall obtain, to the extent practicable, the economic rights and benefits under such Seller Contract with respect to which the Third Person Consent or Authorization has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement. Such reasonable arrangement may include the entering into of a subcontract, sublicense, sublease or other similar arrangement between Seller and the Company. During the period from Closing until such Third Person Consent or Authorization is obtained, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce such Seller Contracts for the benefit of the Company, on the condition that the Company shall bear all costs and expenses (including legal expenses) related to such enforcement. If the Company is able to receive the economic rights and benefits under such Seller Contract, such economic rights and benefits shall constitute an Asset, and the liabilities and obligations, if any, related to such economic rights and benefits under such Asset shall constitute liabilities and obligations of the Company, as applicable. Sellers obligations under this _Section 7.14(b)_ shall expire as of the second anniversary of the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) This _Section 7.14_ shall not apply to any Third Person Consents or Authorizations related to rail cars, which are covered by _Section 7.13_. 

  

 Section 7.15 _Multi-Site Contracts_. 

  

 (a) The Company may be a party to, or otherwise authorized to utilize, certain "master" contracts and agreements and which pertain to multiple refineries and facilities owned by Seller and its Affiliates in addition to the Refinery (each, a " _Multi-Site Contract_ " and collectively, the " _Multi-Site Contracts_ "). Some of those Multi-Site Contracts may constitute Seller Contracts or Material Company Contracts. With respect to all Multi-Site Contracts, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall not be entitled to remain or become a party thereto, or otherwise make use thereof, after Closing, and it is Sellers intention to terminate all Multi-Site Contracts as to the Company effective as of Closing. Notwithstanding such termination, the Company shall be obligated to honor any work releases, purchase commitments or other similar commitments made by them under any Multi-Site Contracts prior to Closing, but not yet fully performed or satisfied as of Closing, so long as such commitments were not made in violation of Sellers obligations under _Section 6.1_. To the extent a Multi-Site Contract by its terms is not terminable as to the Company, Buyer covenants and agrees to (i) negotiate diligently and in good faith with the counterparty(ies) to such Multi-Site Contract in an effort to enter into a new agreement between such counterparty(ies) and the Company as promptly as possible following Closing, and (ii) until such new agreement becomes effective, honor the terms of the Multi-Site Contract and not make any elective purchases or other elective commitments thereunder. Buyer acknowledges that the terms and conditions of Multi-Site Contracts that relate to other facilities of Seller and its Affiliates other than the Refinery (including rate sheets and other commercial terms and conditions covering such other facilities) are confidential and proprietary information of Seller and its Affiliates, and Buyer shall destroy any such information it may inadvertently obtain, and shall not use such information for any purpose. Without

limiting any of Buyers other indemnification obligations under this
Agreement, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees against any and all Losses arising out of Buyers breach or
utilization of any Multi-Site Contract after Closing. 

   

 (b) This _Section 7.15_ shall not apply to any Multi-Site Contracts constituting Rail Car Agreements, which are covered by _Section 7.13_. 

  

 Section 7.16 _Owned and Leased Vehicles_. _Section 7.16_ of the Disclosure Schedules contains a list of all vehicles currently owned by Seller and used at the Refinery (" _Owned Vehicles_ ") and all vehicles currently leased by Seller under fleet leases and used at the Refinery (" _Leased Vehicles_ "). Prior to Closing, Seller shall prepare and file the necessary paperwork to transfer title to all Owned Vehicles to Company, with all transfer taxes, fees and other costs and expenses associated with such title transfers to be borne by Seller. In addition, Seller shall buy the Leased Vehicles out of their current leases and prepare and file the necessary paperwork to transfer title to such Vehicles to Company, with all costs and expenses associated therewith to be borne by Seller, including all buyout payments and title transfer taxes and fees. 

  

 Section 7.17 _Further Assurances_. Without limiting _Section 6.2_, Seller and Buyer each agree that from time to time after the Closing Date they will execute and deliver and will cause their respective Affiliates to execute and deliver such further instruments, and take, and cause their respective Affiliates to take, such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement and the Other Agreements.

with respect to claims or actions based on the breach of representation or

 (a) A Seller Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may be (for purposes of this  _Section 11.4_, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), shall give the indemnifying party under  _Section 11.2_ and _Section 11.3_, as applicable (for purposes of this _Section 11.4_ , an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), prompt written notice of any matter which it has determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this _Article XI_ except to the extent, and only to the extent, the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure or to the extent the survival period, if applicable, expires pursuant to _Section 11.1_ prior to the giving of such notice. 

   

 (b) If any third party shall notify an Indemnified Party with respect to any matter (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") that may give rise to a claim for indemnification against the Indemnifying Party under this _ARTICLE XI_ , then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within five Business Days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this  _ARTICLE XI_ except to the extent, and only to the extent, the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

 _Execution Copy_  

   

 (c) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld) unless the judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Indemnified Party. 

   

 (d) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim as provided in _Section 11.4(c)_, the Indemnified Party may defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may reasonably deem appropriate.

The Losses giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party as a result of the events giving rise to the claim for indemnification, net of any expenses related to the receipt of such proceeds, including retrospective premium adjustments, if any. The amount of the indemnity payment shall be computed by taking into account the timing of the loss or payment, as applicable, at the Applicable Rate from the date the Indemnified Party provides notice of the Loss to the Indemnifying Party until the date paid. Upon the request of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with information sufficient to allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate the amount of the indemnity payment in accordance with this _Section 11.5_. An Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages in respect of any claim for which it is seeking indemnification and shall use reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof;  _provided_ , that an Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to make a claim for recovery against any insurer of such Indemnified Party with respect to any such Losses.

 Section 11.10 _Availability of Equitable Relief_. Each of the parties hereto recognizes that irreparable injury will result from a breach of any provision of this Agreement and that money damages will be inadequate to fully remedy the injury. In order to prevent such irreparable injury, the arbitrators selected pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Procedures shall have the power to grant temporary or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief. Notwithstanding _Section 11.9_, prior to the appointment of the arbitrators, a party hereto may, subject to _Section 11.8_, seek temporary injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction; provided that the party seeking such relief shall (if arbitration has not already been commenced) simultaneously commence arbitration in compliance with the Dispute Resolution Procedures. Such court ordered relief shall not continue more than 10 days after the appointment of the arbitrators (or in any event for longer than 60 days).

any additional obligations or liabilities under this Agreement or the Other

Collateral Assignee or a Collateral Assignees exercise of its security so
granted to it by Buyer, and (iv) neither a collateral assignment of this

Signed counterparts of this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile and by scanned pdf image; _provided_ that each party hereto uses commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to each other party hereto original signed counterparts as soon as possible thereafter.
