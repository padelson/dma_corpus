PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of October 29, 2007, is by and among Grant Prideco, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ "), Vallourec S.A., a corporation organized under the laws of France, and Vallourec and Mannesmann Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively, " _Buyer_ "). 

  

Recital 

   

 WHEREAS, Sellers tubular technology and services division is engaged through certain of its Subsidiaries, in the business of manufacturing and supplying high performance tubular products and services; 

  

 WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions herein, Seller desires to sell or cause to be sold to Buyer and Buyer desires to purchase or cause to be purchased from Seller, Sellers tubular technology and services division, including the following business lines within such division: premium threading, semi-premium threading, all Atlas Bradford product lines regardless of size, Tubular Corporation of America (" _TCA_ "), and Tube-Alloy Corporation, but excluding the Sellers and Sellers Affiliates XL Systems Business and other Excluded Assets (collectively, the " _Business_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, in order to effect the sale of the Business to Buyer, subject to the terms and conditions described herein, Seller, individually or by an Affiliate of Seller designated by Seller (" _Affiliated Seller_ "), will sell or cause to be sold to Buyer and Buyer, individually or by one or more Affiliates of Buyer designated by Buyer (" _Affiliated Buyer_ "), will purchase or cause to be purchased from Seller or an Affiliated Seller: 

  

 (i) 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Tube-Alloy Corporation, a Louisiana corporation (the " _Acquired Entity_ ") pursuant to the structure described in Section 2.4; and 

  

 (ii) substantially all of the assets of the Business owned by Seller and its Affiliates (to the extent such assets are not owned by the Acquired Entity), either by conveyance of such assets directly to Buyer or one or more Affiliated Buyers or by conveyance to Buyer or one or more Affiliated Buyers of all of the general and limited partner interests of Tubular Business LP in accordance with Section 2.3. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements described in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

Article 1 
 Certain Definitions 

   

 1.1 _Certain Defined Terms_. Unless the context otherwise requires, the respective terms defined in Appendix A attached hereto and incorporated herein shall, when used herein, have the respective meanings therein specified, with each such definition to be equally applicable both to the singular and the plural forms of the term so defined. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.2 _References, Gender, Number_. All references in this Agreement to an " _Article_ ," " _Section_ " or " _subsection_ " shall be to an Article, Section, or subsection of this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise. Unless the context otherwise requires, the words "this Agreement," "hereof," "hereunder," "herein," "hereby" or words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to a particular Article, Section, subsection, clause or other subdivision hereof. Whenever the context requires, the words used herein shall include the masculine, feminine and neuter gender, and the singular and the plural. 

  

Article 2 
 Purchase and Sale 

   

 2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. On the terms and subject to conditions described in this Agreement, at the Closing, but effective as of the Effective Time, Seller agrees to, and to cause the Affiliated Sellers to, sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver, or cause to be sold, conveyed, assigned, transferred and delivered, to Buyer or Affiliated Buyers, and Buyer agrees to, or to cause the Affiliated Buyers to, purchase and acquire, or cause to be purchased and acquired, from Seller and the Affiliated Sellers, the assets and equity interests described in this Section 2.1: 

   

 (a) _Purchase of Acquired Assets_. With respect to the Business, all of Sellers and Affiliated Sellers right, title and interest in the assets set forth on Annex A hereto to the extent such assets are not owned by the Acquired Entity (the " _Acquired Assets_ "), by conveyance of such assets directly to Buyer or one or more of the Affiliated Buyers and by conveyance to Buyer or one or more Affiliated Buyers of all of the general and limited partner interests of each Tubular Business LP in accordance with Section 2.3. 

   

 (b) _Purchase of Equity Interests_. 100% of the equity interests of the Acquired Entity, in accordance with Section 2.4. 

   

 (c) _Excluded Assets_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any schedule or any other document executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller and its Affiliates shall retain and shall not convey to Buyer, any of Sellers or its Affiliates right, title and interest to the assets listed on Schedule 2.1(c) (collectively, the " _Excluded Assets_ "), and to the extent any such assets are owned by the Acquired Entity, such Excluded Assets shall be transferred from the Acquired Entity prior to Closing. 

  

 2.2 _Assumed and Excluded Liabilities_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer or Affiliated Buyers shall assume all Assumed Liabilities for the Business and no other. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall not (nor shall the Acquired Entity following the Closing) assume or otherwise be responsible for any Excluded Liabilities. 

  

 2.3 _Conveyance of Certain Assets to Tubular Business LP_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall convey or cause to be conveyed all of the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities (other than the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities associated with the Canadian operations of the Business, which are addressed in Section 2.5 below) to two newly formed Delaware limited partnerships (collectively, " _Tubular Business LP_ "), each of which shall be jointly owned by Seller and an Affiliated Seller and each of which shall be disregarded as a 

   ##### 

  

    

separate entity for federal income tax purposes. The division of such Acquired
Assets and Assumed Liabilities between the two limited partnerships shall be
at the direction of Buyer. At Closing, Seller and any applicable Affiliated
Seller shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer, or one or
more Buyer Affiliates designated by Buyer, all outstanding general
and limited partner interests of each Tubular Business LP. Each Tubular
Business LP shall be considered an Acquired Entity for purposes of this
Agreement. 

  

 2.4 _Conveyance of Tube-Alloy Corporation._  

   

 (a) _Conversion of Tube-Alloy Corporation to Tube-Alloy LP_. If requested by Buyer in writing within 30 days after the date hereof, Seller shall cause Tube-Alloy Corporation to be merged into a newly formed Delaware limited partnership (" _Tube-Alloy LP_ "), in a form that meets Buyers reasonable approval, which shall be jointly owned by Seller or Affiliated Sellers and which shall be treated as a partnership for federal income Tax purposes. One hundred percent (100%) of the partnership interests in Tube-Alloy LP shall be conveyed by Seller and its Affiliated Sellers to Buyer at Closing and shall be considered an Acquired Entity. 

   

 (b) _Code Section _ _338(h)(10)_ _Election_. Notwithstanding Section 2.4(a) above, if requested by Buyer, Buyer and Seller shall join in making an election under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding election under state, local, or foreign Tax Law) (collectively, a " _3_ _38(h)(10)_ _Election_ ") with respect to any purchase and sale of the stock of Tube-Alloy Corporation and any of its subsidiaries hereunder. 

  

 2.5 _Conveyance of Canadian Assets_. All of the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities related to the Canadian operations of the Business shall be conveyed directly by Seller or its Affiliates to an Affiliate of Buyer designated by Buyer. 

  

Article 3 
 Purchase Price and Payment 

   

 3.1 _Purchase Price_. 

   

 (a) _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the sale of the Acquired Assets and the Acquired Entity to Buyer and Affiliated Buyers is eight hundred million U.S. dollars (US$800,000,000.00) (the " _Purchase Price_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, plus the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities. 

   

 (b) _Adjustment Amount_. The " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ " shall be the Purchase Price increased or decreased, as the case may be, by an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount. The " _Adjustment Amount_ " shall be equal to: (i) the net increase to, or net decrease from, the Working Capital between the Balance Sheet Date and the Closing Date; minus (ii) the actual amount of Net Debt at Closing Date. For purposes of clarity, an increase in Working Capital under the preceding sentence shall be represented by a positive number and a decrease in Working Capital shall be represented by a negative number, and a positive Net Debt would reduce the Purchase Price and a negative Net Debt position would result in an increase of the Purchase Price. 

   ##### 

  

    

" _Working Capital_ " shall be the arithmetic sum of (i) a positive amount
equal to the total current assets of the Business (including inventory and
accounts receivable), and (ii) a negative amount equal to the total current
liabilities of the Business, in each case as such assets and liabilities are
included on the Balance Sheet, or would be included on a pro forma balance
sheet of the Business (as of the Closing Date) prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Balance Sheet of the Business.
Buyer and Seller each acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of this
calculation the amount of the Working Capital as of the Balance Sheet Date is
US$62,000,000.00. A schedule and guideline for calculating Working Capital at
the Closing Date is set forth on Annex B. The Balance Sheet as of the Closing
Date is referred to as the " _Closing Balance Sheet_." In addition, Buyer and
Seller each acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of the calculation of
the Working Capital on the Closing Date, the following principles shall
apply: 

   

 (i) Excluded Assets and any assets not purchased by Buyer shall not be reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet; 

   

 (ii) Excluded Liabilities and any liabilities not assumed by Buyer or extinguished by Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date shall not be reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet; 

   

 (iii) prepaid intercompany corporate and divisional allocations and intercompany accounts between the Business and Seller and its Affiliates shall not be reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet, and all such balances shall be released in connection with the Closing pursuant to Section 7.17; and 

   

 (iv) Accrued Vacation (Section 6.2(e)), Health Care Costs (Section 6.2(d)), federal and state income taxes (Sections 6.1(a) and (b)) and prepaid insurance premiums shall not be included in Working Capital on the Balance Sheet or the Closing Balance Sheet. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that any Taxes relating to a pre-closing period that will be the responsibility of Buyer or its Affiliates shall be accrued as a current liability on the Closing Balance Sheet and shall reduce the Purchase Price. 

  

 3.2 _Closing Statement_. Not later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a detailed statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") of the estimated purchase price adjustments and the estimated Adjusted Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price_ ") for each of the Acquired Assets and for the Acquired Entity. 

  

 3.3 _Payment_. At the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliated Buyer(s) to, wire transfer the Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price, in immediately available funds for the account of Seller or one or more Affiliates of Seller, as specified by Seller to Buyer at least five Business Days preceding the Closing Date. 

  

 3.4 _Post-Closing Adjustment to the Purchase Price_. 

   

 (a) _Revised Closing Statement_. After the Closing, Buyer (or Buyers external auditors (at Buyers cost and expense), if it so desires) shall determine the Adjustment 

   ##### 

  

    

Amount. On or before the date that is 30 days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall deliver to Seller a Closing Balance Sheet and revised Closing Statement
setting forth the actual Adjustment Amount and such supporting documentation
reasonably necessary to support the Adjustment Amount. To the extent
reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller shall assist in the preparation of the
revised Closing Statement. Buyer shall provide to Seller such data and
information as Seller may reasonably request supporting the amounts reflected
on the revised Closing Statement to permit Seller (or Sellers external
auditors (at Sellers cost and expense), if it so desires) to perform or
cause to be performed a review of the revised Closing Statement. Seller and
Buyer shall conduct or cause to be conducted a physical inventory of the
inventory reflected on the Closing Statement in a manner mutually agreed upon
between Buyer and Seller immediately following the Closing Date, which
inventory must be completed no later than fourteen days after the Closing
Date. Buyer and Seller may each, at their respective options and own expense,
have one or more representatives (including outside auditors, if it so
desires) present at such physical inventory. The results of the physical
inventory will be taken into account in the Closing Statement. The revised
Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the date
(the " _Final Settlement Date_ ") that is 30 days following receipt thereof
by Seller unless Seller gives written notice of its disagreement (" _Notice
of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any
disagreement so asserted and Sellers alternative calculations of each
amount. If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer in a timely manner,
then the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with paragraph (b) or
(c) below) shall become final and binding on the parties on, and the Final
Settlement Date shall be, the earlier of (i) the date upon which Seller and
Buyer agree in writing with respect to all matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement or (ii) the date upon which the Final Closing Statement is
issued by the Closing Statement Arbitrator. 

   

 (b) _Final Closing Statement_. During the 30 days following the date upon which Buyer receives the Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall attempt to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such 30-day period (or earlier by mutual agreement to arbitrate) Buyer and Seller have not reached agreement on such matters, the matters that remain in dispute (and only such matters) shall be submitted to an arbitrator (the " _Closing Statement Arbitrator_ ") for review and final and binding resolution conducted in Houston, Texas. The Closing Statement Arbitrator shall be PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. (Houston office), or if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller in writing. If the parties have not agreed upon an accounting firm by the date that is 30 days after the date upon which Buyer received the Notice of Disagreement, then the Closing Statement Arbitrator shall be selected, upon application of Buyer and Seller, by the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P. (Houston office) within ten days of receipt of such application. Each party shall, not later than seven days prior to the hearing date set by the Closing Statement Arbitrator (which hearing shall take place within 30 days after selection of the Closing Statement Arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties), submit a brief with dollar figures for settlement of the disputes as to the amount of the Adjusted 

   ##### 

  

    

Purchase Price (together with a proposed Closing Statement that reflects
such figures). The hearing shall be conducted on a confidential basis. The
Closing Statement Arbitrator shall render a decision resolving the matters in
dispute (which decision shall include a written statement of findings and
conclusions) within ten days after the conclusion of the hearing, unless the
parties reach agreement prior thereto and withdraw the dispute from
arbitration. The Closing Statement Arbitrator shall provide to the parties
explanations in writing of the reasons for its decisions regarding the
Adjusted Purchase Price (including a worksheet setting forth all material
calculations) and shall issue the Final Closing Statement of the Closing
Statement Arbitrator reflecting such decisions (the " _Arbitrator s Closing
Statement_"). The decision of the Closing Statement Arbitrator shall be final

Except as will be accrued for on the Closing Balance Sheet and result in a reduction of the Purchase Price, Seller does not have knowledge of any fact or circumstance (including, but not limited to, the existence of any valid counterclaim or set-off) that would lead it to believe that any material account receivable or any material note receivable relating to the Business is not collectible in the ordinary course of business, without any set-off or counterclaim.

Any inventory that has been written down has either been written off or written down to its net realizable value. There has been no change in 

   ##### 

  

    

inventory valuation standards or methods with respect to the inventory of the
Business in the prior three years. The quantities of inventory are not

Seller or its Affiliates shall cause each Transferred Employee who was participating in Sellers or its Affiliates Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time to be fully vested in his or her benefits (other than severance benefits) thereunder as at the Effective Time (including without limitation, the vesting of any unvested stock options or other equity-based awards and the vesting of account balances under Sellers Executive Deferred Compensation Plan). Seller or its Affiliates shall take necessary steps to effectuate the prior sentence, including without limitation amending or causing to be amended Sellers or its Affiliates Benefit Plans. As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall allow all Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents to participate in Buyers benefit plans (excluding any defined benefit and cash balance plans) as necessary to comply with the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Law, without any gap or loss of benefits or coverage. The Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents shall not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitations, and Buyer shall recognize all service credited to any Transferred Employee on the Sellers books and records for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) in the Buyers benefit plans. Buyer or Buyers Affiliate shall adopt for the benefit of the Transferred Employees the severance policy set forth on Schedule 6.2(c). Prior to the Closing Date, and to the extent necessary to implement this sentence, Seller shall amend any Benefit Plan and take or cause to be taken all other action as may be required to provide that severance or separation payments shall not be payable to any Transferred 

   ##### 

  

    

Employee on account of such employees termination of employment with Seller.
Should any severance or separation obligations or liabilities arise with
respect to the termination of employment of any Business Employees prior to
or as of the Closing Date, then such obligations and liabilities shall be
borne by Seller. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller or its Affiliate
shall cause the Transferred Employees to be paid annual incentive
compensation bonuses to the extent a liability has been accrued therefor
on Sellers or its Affiliates balance sheet. 

   

 (d) _Retained and Assumed Liabilities_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.2(e) below, Seller shall retain responsibility for all benefits accrued or claims made or (with respect to claims for workers compensation, group life, accidental death and dismemberment, disability or health plan benefits) incurred prior to the Effective Time under Sellers Benefit Plans. Claims will be deemed to be incurred on the date that the event or service giving rise to such claim occurs or is performed. Seller shall retain responsibility for any continuation coverage obligations under COBRA to any Terminated Employees and Offered Employees who do not become Transferred Employees, and their respective covered dependents, who incur a COBRA qualifying event or loss of coverage under any of Sellers group health plans at any time on or prior to the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliate to provide COBRA continuation coverage to all Transferred Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur or incurred a qualifying event or loss at any time with respect to claims incurred on or after the Effective Time. Except as specifically retained by Seller, Buyer or Buyers Affiliate shall assume responsibility for all expenses and benefits for claims made or incurred by any Transferred Employee or such Transferred Employees eligible dependents on or after the Effective Time. 

   

 From and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume responsibility for compliance with, as well as any liability which may exist or arise out of WARN on account of any Transferred Employee terminated after the Effective Time. No later than five business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list setting forth the number of Business Employees terminated from each site of employment of the Business during the 90-day period ending on the Closing Date for reasons qualifying the termination as "employment losses" under WARN and the date of each such termination with respect to each termination; provided, that this sentence shall not apply with respect to any site of employment at which sufficient employees have not been employed at any time in such 90-day period for terminations of employment at such site to be subject to WARN. 

   

 Seller or its Affiliates shall retain all responsibility for any transaction bonus, retention, incentive or similar payments established by Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as specifically provided in this Section 6.2 or as is accrued as a current liability on the Closing Balance Sheet thereby resulting in a reduction in Purchase Price, Buyer shall not assume any Benefit Plan or any agreements that become effective following a change in control of Seller or its Affiliates (" _Change in Control Agreements_ ") maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Seller or Sellers Affiliates, and Buyer shall not be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise 

   ##### 

  

    

discharge any liabilities of the Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates relating
to any Benefit Plan or Change in Control Agreement. 

   

 (e) _Vacation_. Buyer shall assume all liabilities for the Transferred Employees with respect to accrued unused vacation and paid time off (" _PTO_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall allow each Transferred Employee either to (i) take in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, all PTO to which such Transferred Employee is entitled in such year, less any PTO taken by such Transferred Employee as of the Effective Time or (ii) receive vacation pay in lieu of any accrued unused PTO for such calendar year as of the Effective Time. 

   

 (f) _Payroll Taxes_. Seller and Buyer shall (i) treat Buyer and its Affiliate thereof as applicable, as a "successor employer" and Seller as a "predecessor" within the meaning of Sections 3121(a)(1) and 3306(b)(1) of the Code, with respect to Transferred Employees who are employed by Buyer or such Affiliate for purposes of Taxes imposed in the United States Federal Unemployment Tax Act (" _FUTA_ ") or the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act (" _FICA_ ") and (ii) cooperate with each other to avoid, to the extent possible, the filing of more than one United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 with respect to each such Transferred Employee for the calendar year in which the Effective time occurs. 

   

 (g) _Laboratory Technicians_. The current laboratory personnel are listed on Schedule 6.2(g). Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall work together to determine in good faith those laboratory technicians that will be transferred with the Business to Buyer and those laboratory technicians that will remain with Seller and will not be transferred. Such division will permit Buyer to take the laboratory manager, all test engineers and up to nine laboratory technicians, and will permit Seller to retain the remaining laboratory technicians (it being understood that the test engineers for the Business are already included in the definition of Business Employees). The laboratory technicians that are allocated to Buyer shall be considered Business Employees. The laboratory technicians who are allocated to Seller shall not be considered Business Employees.

proposed transaction from any U.S. or state government authority pursuant to
the HSR Act, or under any similar foreign competition statutes or
regulations, provided however that nothing herein shall require Buyer to take

If and to the extent that Seller or its Affiliates do not or are unable to
transfer, assign, or license any particular third party software to Buyer,

enhancements as may be necessary to carry on the Business as currently

Seller shall or shall cause its Subsidiaries to undertake to transfer,
assign, or license (as appropriate) all computer software systems necessary
to operate the Business, if such transfer, assignment, or license is, in the
judgment of Seller, legally possible and commercially reasonable.
Buyer acknowledges that it may not be possible for Seller to transfer,
assign, or license all such software systems. In addition to the payment of
the Purchase Price, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller, upon receipt of a
statement from Seller, for the amount of any fees, royalties, or charges of
third parties incurred by Seller or its Affiliates to take the action
specified in clause (ii) above to the extent approved by Buyer in advance.

 (c) Regarding any software developed under contract by third parties for use by Seller, Seller warrants that it has all right, title and interest to such software, and that it will assign all such right, title and interest to such software to Buyer. 

  

 7.12 _Seller Obligations_. Seller and its Affiliates have contingent liability under certain agreements, instruments, obligations and guaranties in the respective amounts under the agreements or instruments described in Schedule 7.12, as well as letters of credit, bonds, guarantees and similar instruments entered into after signing of this Agreement and prior to Closing (collectively, the " _Seller Obligations_ ").

 10.1 _Indemnification By Seller_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Article 10, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Affiliated Buyers and each of their directors, officers, employees, successors, and assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses (other than to the extent accrued for on the Closing Balance Sheet) actually incurred, directly or indirectly, by any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties (i) for any breach of Sellers representations or warranties made, as of the Closing Date, in this Agreement, (ii) for any breach of the covenants or obligations of Seller and its Affiliates (other than any post-Closing covenants or obligations of the Acquired Entity) under this Agreement, (iii) for any breach of the MTLA caused by Seller or its Affiliates or by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for such breaches that are the result of Buyer not timely performing its obligations under the MTLA Letter Agreement) (collectively, " _MTLA Breaches_ "), (iv) in connection with any Known Litigation and (v) in connection with any Excluded Liabilities. 

   

 (b) Regarding the Watts et al v. XL Systems, L.P. and Grant Prideco patent infringement litigation, CA 1:06-cv-00653-LY (" _Watts Litigation_ "), Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from any claims of damages (including damages for willful infringement) or attorneys fees arising out of Buyers continued use of TC II or other Sellers products found to infringe, or features of such products found to infringe in the Watts Litigation, after Closing. Additionally, should any injunction be issued against continued manufacture, use or sale of TC II or other products found to infringe in the Watts Litigation, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer for loss or impairment of its right to manufacture, use or sell TC II, including but not limited to actual and consequential damages (including damages for willful infringement) to Buyer, and attorneys fees. Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with Seller, at Sellers expense, in the defense of the Watts Litigation and the other Known Litigation, by making the Transferred Employees and Records available to Seller to assist Seller in the defense of such actions. 

  

 10.2 _Indemnification By Buyer_.

   ##### 

  

  

 10.3 _Third Party Claims_. Except as set forth in Section 10.2, if a claim by a third party is made against a Seller Indemnified Party or a Buyer Indemnified Party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") after Closing, and if such party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under Section 5.1, 7.11, 10.1 or 10.2, such Indemnified Party shall promptly furnish written notice to the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") of such claims. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail, the facts and circumstances surrounding such claim and the basis under this Agreement for indemnification (it being understood that the 30 day period pursuant to which an indemnifying party may elect to assume defense is not triggered until and unless sufficient facts and circumstances and details are alleged or provided, to the extent known by the Indemnified Party, to form a basis for indemnification), but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability hereunder unless and only to the extent the Indemnitor has suffered prejudice by such failure. The Indemnitor, at its sole option, shall be entitled to participate in the defense and to the extent that it wishes, shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice to so notify the Indemnified Party and to undertake, conduct and control (at its sole expense and through counsel of its own choosing that is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party, if so requested, shall reasonably cooperate with it in connection therewith; provided that the Indemnitor shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in, be continuously informed and monitor (but not control or conduct) such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party (however, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party). After notice from the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Article 10 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs of investigation and shall be entitled to settle any such claim provided the Indemnitor pays all monetary costs of such settlement and such settlement (i) does not in any material way restrict the ability of Buyer and its Affiliates to operate the Business in substantially the same manner as conducted by Seller and its Affiliates, (ii) does not commit the Indemnified Party to take, or forbear to take, any action or admit to any wrongdoing of any kind and (iii) provides for a full and complete release by the third party of the Indemnified Party. In addition, the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment that does not relate solely to monetary damages without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. So long as the Indemnitor, at Indemnitors cost and expense, (i) has undertaken the defense of such claim, (ii) is diligently contesting such claim in good faith, by appropriate proceedings, and (iii) has taken such action as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the property of the Indemnified Party for payment of such claim, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. Notwithstanding compliance by the Indemnitor with the preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim after advance notice to the Indemnitor, provided that in such event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnitor for such claim and unconditionally releases the Indemnitor from all liability arising out of such claim. If within 30 days after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder, the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnified Party in writing that it elects (at Indemnitors cost and expense) to undertake the defense thereof, or gives such notice and thereafter fails to contest diligently such claim in good faith or to prevent action to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the Indemnified Partys property as contemplated above, the Indemnitor shall be deemed a waiver of its right to control and 

   ##### 

  

    

participate in such matter and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
contest, settle and/or compromise the claim without thereby waiving any right
to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnitor shall not be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition
to any local counsel required in any other jurisdiction) for all the
Indemnified Parties. 

  

 10.4 _Limitation of Seller s Liability_. 

   

 (a) _Individual Threshold_. Seller and its Affiliates shall have no liability to Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.1 with respect to a particular breach or nonfulfillment of a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement on the part of Seller or Affiliated Seller under this Agreement if the Losses resulting from such breach or nonfulfillment do not exceed a per item threshold of $25,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the individual threshold shall not apply to Losses associated with Known Litigation, Excluded Liabilities, MTLA Breaches or the Watts Litigation. Additionally, this Section 10.4(a) shall not apply to Section 4.1(m)(iv), any Losses under Section 10.11 (taxes) or breaches of representations or warranties that constitute fraud. 

   

 (b) _Aggregate Threshold_. Seller shall have no liability to Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to Losses described in Section 10.1, unless and until the aggregate of such Losses (each exceeding the per item threshold described in Section 10.4(a) above) exceeds an aggregate threshold equal to $16,000,000, and then from the first dollar of such Losses. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate threshold shall not apply to Losses associated with Known Litigation, Excluded Liabilities, MTLA Breaches or the Watts Litigation. Additionally, this Section 10.4(b) shall not apply to Section 4.1(m)(iv), any Losses under Section 10.11 (taxes) or breaches of representations or warranties that constitute fraud. 

   

 (c) _Aggregate Limit on Liability_. Seller shall have no liability to Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to Losses described in Section 10.1, or to pay any other amount in connection with or with respect to the Business, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in any amount exceeding, in the aggregate, 30 percent of the Adjusted Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate limit on liability shall not apply to Losses associated with Known Litigation, Excluded Liabilities, MTLA Breaches or the Watts Litigation. Additionally, this Section 10.4(c) shall not apply to Section 4.1(m)(iv), any Losses under Section 10.11 (taxes) or breaches of representations or warranties that constitute fraud. 

  

 10.5 _Mitigation_. Buyer shall have a duty to mitigate any Loss as to which an indemnity applies under this Article 10.
