is made against a Seller Indemnified Party or a Buyer Indemnified Party (an &#147;<I>Indemnified Party</I>&#148;)
after Closing, and if such party intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under Section&nbsp;5.1,
7.11, 10.1 or 10.2, such Indemnified Party shall promptly furnish written notice to the
indemnifying party (the &#147;<I>Indemnitor</I>&#148;) of such claims. Such notice shall specify in reasonable
detail, the facts and circumstances surrounding such claim and the basis under this Agreement for
indemnification (it being understood that the 30&nbsp;day period pursuant to which an indemnifying party
may elect to assume defense is not triggered until and unless sufficient facts and circumstances
and details are alleged or provided, to the extent known by the Indemnified Party, to form a basis
for indemnification), but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability hereunder unless and only to the extent the Indemnitor has suffered prejudice by such
failure. The Indemnitor, at its sole option, shall be entitled to participate in the defense and
to the extent that it wishes, shall have 30&nbsp;days after receipt of such notice to so notify the
Indemnified Party and to undertake, conduct and control (at its sole expense and through counsel of
its own choosing that is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) the settlement or defense
thereof, and the Indemnified Party, if so requested, shall reasonably cooperate with it in
connection therewith; provided that the Indemnitor shall permit the Indemnified Party to
participate in, be continuously informed and monitor (but not control or conduct) such settlement
or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party (however, the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party). After notice from the Indemnitor to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnitor
shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Article&nbsp;10 for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable out-of-pocket costs of investigation and shall be entitled to settle any such claim
provided the Indemnitor pays all monetary costs of such settlement and such settlement (i)&nbsp;does not
in any material way restrict the ability of Buyer and its Affiliates to operate the Business in
substantially the same manner as conducted by Seller and its Affiliates, (ii)&nbsp;does not commit the
Indemnified Party to take, or forbear to take, any action or admit to any wrongdoing of any kind
and (iii)&nbsp;provides for a full and complete release by the third party of the Indemnified Party. In
addition, the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment that does not relate solely
to monetary damages without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld. So long as the Indemnitor, at Indemnitor&#146;s cost and expense, (i)&nbsp;has
undertaken the defense of such claim, (ii)&nbsp;is diligently contesting such claim in good faith, by
appropriate proceedings, and (iii)&nbsp;has taken such action as may be necessary to prevent any action
to foreclose a lien against or attachment of the property of the Indemnified Party for payment of
such claim, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. Notwithstanding
compliance by the Indemnitor with the preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to pay or settle any such claim after advance notice to the Indemnitor, provided that in such
event it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnitor for such claim and
unconditionally releases the Indemnitor from all liability arising out of such claim. If within 30
days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party&#146;s notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder, the
Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnified Party in writing that it elects (at Indemnitor&#146;s cost
and expense) to undertake the defense thereof, or gives such notice and thereafter fails to contest
diligently such claim in good faith or to prevent action to foreclose a lien against or attachment
of the Indemnified Party&#146;s property as contemplated above, the Indemnitor shall be deemed a waiver
of its right to control and
