AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of November 2,
2009, by and among Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), R Acquisition Company, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger
Sub"), and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company").

 

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent, the sole member of Merger Sub, and
the Board of Directors of the Company have approved, and determined that it
is advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies and
equityholders to consummate, the merger of the Company with and into Merger
Sub (the "Merger"), with Merger Sub as the surviving entity in the Merger,
upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
pursuant to which each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (the "Company Common Stock" and, in the aggregate, the "Shares")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in
Section 1.2), other than Shares described in Section 2.1(b) and any
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.1), will be converted into the
right to receive, at the election of the holders of Company Common Stock and
subject to the terms hereof, a portion of a share of Class A Common Stock,
$5.00 par value per share, of Parent ("Parent Class A Stock"), or a portion
of a share of Class B Common Stock, $0.1667 par value per share, of Parent
("Parent Class B Stock" and, together with the Parent Class A Stock, "Parent
Stock"), or cash; and

 

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and

 

 

WHEREAS, for United States Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this
Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I 

 

 

THE MERGER

 

 

Section 1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL") and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the "DLLCA"), at the
Effective Time, the Company and Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger
pursuant to which (a) the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub
and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease,
(b) Merger Sub shall be the successor or surviving entity in the Merger (the
"Surviving Entity") under the name "Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC" and
shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and (c)
the separate existence of Merger Sub with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger.
After the Effective Time, (x) the certificate of formation of Merger Sub
shall be amended as desired by Parent and as so amended shall become the
certificate of formation of the Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended,
and (y) the operating agreement of Merger Sub shall be amended as desired by
Parent and as so amended shall become the operating agreement of the
Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in the DGCL and the DLLCA.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1.2 Effective Time. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company shall cause
an appropriate Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be
executed and filed on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1.3) with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State") as
provided in the DGCL and DLLCA. The Merger shall become effective on the date
on which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State or such later time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in
the Certificate of Merger, and such time is hereinafter referred to as
the "Effective Time."

 

 

Section 1.3 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., on a date to be specified by the parties, which shall be
as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the fourth business day,
after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI
hereof (the "Closing Date"), at, or directed from, the offices of Munger,
Tolles and Olson LLP, 355 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90071,
unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

 

 

Section 1.4 Officers of the Surviving Entity. The officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective
Time, be the officers of the Surviving Entity until their successors shall
have been duly elected or appointed or qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Entity's
certificate of formation and operating agreement.

 

 

ARTICLE II 

 

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 

 

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

 

 

(a) Conversion of Company Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares, Dissenting Shares and Company Restricted Shares the vesting of which
was not accelerated pursuant to Section 2.5(f) (each as defined below)) shall
be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
following consideration, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2 (in the
aggregate for all shares of Company Common Stock, the "Merger
Consideration"):

 

 

(i) Cash Election Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock with respect
to which an election to receive cash has been made and not revoked or lost
(each such share, together with any shares for which such an election is
deemed to have been made under clause (iii) below, the "Cash Election
Shares") shall be converted into the right to receive $100.00 in cash without
interest (the "Cash Consideration").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Stock Election Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock with respect
to which an election to receive stock has been made and not revoked or lost
(each such share, together with any shares for which such an election is
deemed to have been made under clause (iii) below, the "Stock Election
Shares") shall be converted into the right to receive the portion of a share
of Parent Class A Stock equal to the Class A Exchange Ratio; provided that
if after applying this calculation to all Stock Election Shares held by
a particular holder, that holder would become entitled to receive a fraction
of a share of Parent Class A Stock, in lieu of receiving such fractional
share, the holder shall have the right to receive that number of shares of
Parent Class B Stock as is equal to a quotient (A) the numerator of which is
the product of (x) such fraction multiplied by (y) the Average Parent Class A
Stock Price and (B) the denominator of which is the Average Parent Class B
Stock Price (such quotient, the "Class B Exchange Ratio"); and provided
further that if such holder would then become entitled to receive a fraction
of a share of Parent Class B Stock, in lieu of such fractional share, the
holder shall have the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of
(x) such fraction and (y) the Average Parent Class B Stock Price (the
"Stock Consideration").

 

 

(iii) No Election Shares. With respect to each share of Company Common Stock
for which no election to receive cash or stock has been made (A) in the event
the Average Parent Class A Stock Price is less than $79,777.34, the holder
thereof shall be deemed to have made an election to receive cash and such
shares shall constitute "Cash Election Shares", (B) in the event the Average
Parent Class A Stock Price is greater than $124,652.09, the holder thereof
shall be deemed to have made an election to receive stock and such shares
shall constitute "Stock Election Shares" and (C) otherwise, such shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration or Stock
Consideration or a combination of both, as provided in Section 2.2 below
(each share described in clause (C), a "No Election Share").

 

 

(iv) Fractional Shares of Company Common Stock. Any fractional shares of
Company Common Stock resulting from the proration calculations in Section 2.2
shall be entitled to a proportionate share of the applicable Merger
Consideration.

 

 

(b) Parent or Company Owned Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent or the Company or their respective direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries ("Excluded Shares"), in each case immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be canceled without any conversion thereof, and no
Merger Consideration shall be paid with respect thereto.

 

 

(c) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, if and to the extent required by the DGCL, shares of Company
Common Stock which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by holders of such shares of Company Common
Stock who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto (the
"Dissenting Shares") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, shall not be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders
of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their rights to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to have
become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of Shares for which no election to
receive cash or stock has been made, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.1(c), if
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, then the right of
any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholder's Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company
for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL which are received by the Company
relating to such holder's rights of appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal or offer
to settle or settle any such demands.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Merger Sub Membership Interests. Each membership interest in Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding from and after the Effective Time as the membership
interests of the Surviving Entity in the Merger.

 

 

(e) Adjustments. If after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time,
(i) the Company pays a dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller number of
shares, or issues by reclassification any shares of Company Common Stock (or
undertakes any similar act) or (ii) Parent pays a dividend in, splits,
combines into a smaller number of shares, or issues by reclassification any
shares of Class A Parent Stock or Class B Parent Stock (or undertakes any
similar act); then the Merger Consideration, the Stock Consideration, the
Cash Consideration, the Class A Exchange Ratio, the Class B Exchange Ratio,
the number of shares of Parent Class B Stock obtainable by holders of stock
options and restricted stock units pursuant to Section 2.5, and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide to the holders of the Company Common Stock, stock options
and restricted stock units the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action, and as so adjusted shall, from and after the
date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, the Stock Consideration, the
Cash Consideration, the Class A Exchange Ratio, the Class B Exchange Ratio,
the number of shares of Parent Class B Stock obtainable by holders of stock
options and restricted stock units pursuant to Section 2.5 or other dependent
item, as applicable, subject to further adjustment in accordance with this
provision.

 

 

(f)   Certificates. From and after the Effective Time, the Company Common
Stock converted into Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall
no longer remain outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate previously representing any
such Company Common Stock or shares of Company Common Stock that are in non-
certificated book-entry form (either case being referred to herein, to the
extent applicable, as a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Common Stock except the right to receive
(i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) any dividends and other distributions
in accordance with Section 2.4(f).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 2.2 Proration. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary and subject to Section 2.2(d):

 

 

(a) Cash Elections Exceeding the Available Cash Amount. If the product of the
aggregate number of Cash Election Shares and the Cash Consideration (such
product being the "Elected Cash Consideration") exceeds the Available Cash
Amount, then:

 

 

(i) all Stock Election Shares and all No Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

 

 

(ii) a portion of the Cash Election Shares of each holder of Company Common
Stock (if any) shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, with such portion being equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of such holder's Cash Election Shares by (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Amount and the
denominator of which shall be the Elected Cash Consideration, with the
remaining portion of such holder's Cash Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 

 

(b) Cash Elections Under the Available Cash Amount. If the Elected Cash
Consideration is less than the Available Cash Amount (such difference being
the "Shortfall Number"), then:

 

 

(i) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration; and

 

 

(ii) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be treated in the
following manner: (A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to
the product of the aggregate number of No Election Shares and $100 (the "No
Election Value"), then (1) all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration and (2) the No Election Shares
of each holder of Company Common Stock (if any) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of No
Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number
of No Election Shares of such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the No Election
Value, with the remaining portion of such holder's No Election Shares (if
any) being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or
(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the No Election Value, then (1) all No
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and (2) a portion of the Stock Election Shares of each holder
of Company Common Stock (if any) shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Consideration, with such portion being equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares of such holder by (y)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which the Shortfall
Number exceeds the No Election Value, and the denominator of which is the
product obtained by multiplying the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares
by $100.00, with the remaining portion of such holder's Stock Election Shares
being converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 

 

(c) Cash Elections Equal to the Available Cash Amount. If the Elected Cash
Consideration equals the Available Cash Amount, then:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration; and

 

 

(ii) all Stock Election and No Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 

 

(d) Cash Limit. The proration calculations provided for in this Section 2.2,
and the calculation provided for in this Section 2.2(d), shall be applied
iteratively so that the total amount of cash paid to holders of
Company Common Stock on account of the Merger, including cash paid in lieu of
fractional shares and cash payable in respect of Dissenting Shares (the
"Cash Limit"), shall be as close as practicable to 60% of the sum of (i) the
Cash Limit, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Class A Stock to be issued
in the Merger multiplied by the VWAP of such a share on the trading day
that immediately precedes the Closing Date and (iii) the number of shares of
Parent Class B Stock to be issued in the Merger multiplied by the VWAP of
such a share on the trading day that immediately precedes the Closing Date.
For purposes of the foregoing and Section 2.6(a), (x) cash payable in respect
of a Dissenting Share shall be deemed to equal the greater of (i) $100 and
(ii) an amount equal to the Class A Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Average
Parent Class A Stock Price, and (y) the total amount of Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of the No Election Shares and the composition thereof,
including the total number of shares of Parent Class A Stock and Parent Class
B Stock to be issued to such holders, and the amount of cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares thereto, shall be deemed to be the amounts thereof
that Parent and the Company reasonably estimate on the Closing Date.

 

 

Section 2.3 Elections.

 

 

(a) Election Form. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
anticipated Effective Time (the "Mailing Date"), an election form in such
form as Parent shall specify (the "Election Form") shall be mailed to each
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock as of five (5) business
days prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election Form Record Date").

 

 

(b) Choice of Election. Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or
the beneficial owner through customary documentation and instructions) to
specify (i) the number of shares of such holder's Company Common Stock with
respect to which such holder elects to receive the Stock Consideration, (ii)
the number of shares of such holder's Company Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Cash Consideration or (iii) that such
holder makes no election with respect to such holder's Company Common Stock.
Any Company Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent does not
receive a properly completed Election Form during the period (the "Election
Period") from the Mailing Date to 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the second
business day prior to the Effective Time (the "Election Deadline") shall be
deemed not to have made an election with respect to such holder's Company
Common Stock. Parent shall publicly announce the anticipated
Election Deadline at least five (5) business days prior to the anticipated
Effective Time. If the Effective Time is delayed to a subsequent date,
the Election Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and
Parent shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the
rescheduled Election Deadline.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) New Holders. Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as
may reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who
become holders or beneficial owners of Company Common Stock during the
Election Period, and the Company shall provide the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform its duties as specified
herein.

 

 

(d) Revocations; Exchange Agent. Any election made pursuant to this Section
2.3 shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have
actually received a properly completed Election Form during the Election
Period. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting
it, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent during the Election
Period. In the event an Election Form is revoked during the Election Period,
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall be
deemed to be shares in respect of which no election has been made, except to
the extent a subsequent election is properly made during the
Election Period. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and
any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall
be binding and conclusive. None of Parent or the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an
Election Form.

 

 

Section 2.4 Exchange of Certificates.

 

 

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint
an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent")
for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for Merger Consideration. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more than
five (5) business days following the Effective Time, Parent will send,
or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of shares
of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time (and, to the extent
commercially practicable, to make available for collection by hand if so
elected by such holder of record), whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the
Exchange Agent) in such form as the Company and Parent may reasonably agree,
including instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(b) Deposit. When and as needed, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock, shares of Parent Stock and an amount of cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to be issued and paid pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section
2.2, payable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.
Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent, when and as needed, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.4(f). All cash and
book-entry shares representing shares of Parent Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "Exchange Fund."
The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the
appropriate Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such
consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests and Parent shall
promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such
consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to,
Parent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Exchange. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the number of shares of Parent
Class A Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of
Parent Class A Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive, (ii)
the number of shares of Parent Class B Stock representing, in the aggregate,
the whole number of shares of Parent Class B Stock, if any, that such holder
has the right to receive, and/or (iii) a check in the amount, if any, that
such holder has the right to receive in cash, including cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares and dividends and other distributions payable pursuant
to Section 2.4(f) (subject to Section 2.4(g)), pursuant to Section 2.1,
Section 2.2 and this Article II. Following the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable (by mail or, to the
extent commercially practicable, made available for collection by hand if so
elected by the surrendering holder of a Certificate) after receipt by the
Exchange Agent of the Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance
with the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid
dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates.

 

 

(d) Other Payees. If any cash payment is to be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a person other than
the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in
the name of a person other than the person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the
registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of
such registration in the name of a person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

 

(e) No Further Transfers. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable laws.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Exchange
Agent or Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article
II.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Dividends and Distributions. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as
provided in this Section 2.4. Following such surrender, subject to the effect
of escheat, Tax or other applicable laws, there shall be paid, without
interest, to the record holder of the Parent Stock, if any, issued in
exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other
distributions payable in respect of any such shares of Parent Class A Stock
or Parent Class B Stock, as applicable, with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender
and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of
Parent Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Stock, all shares of Parent
Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding
as of the Effective Time.

 

 

(g) Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger such amounts
as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent amounts are so withheld by Parent,
the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made.

 

 

(h) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of the Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates as contemplated by this Article
II.

 

 

(i)   Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged his or her shares of Company Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II prior
to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Entity or the Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws. Any Merger Consideration
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any governmental authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable laws, become the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.5 Company Option Plans.

 

 

(a) If the Parent Approvals are obtained, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or, if appropriate or required, any committee or other entity or
person administering the Company Stock Plans (as defined below), as well as
any required subset of the Board of Directors) shall adopt such resolutions
and take such other actions as may be required to adjust the terms of all
outstanding Company Stock Options (as defined below) granted under any of the
Company Stock Plans to provide that, at the Effective Time, (I) each Company
Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed to constitute an option (an "Adjusted Option") to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option, the
number of shares of Parent Class B Stock equal to the product of (1) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such
Company Stock Option and (2) the Option Exchange Ratio, provided that any
fractional shares of Parent Class B Stock resulting from such multiplication
shall be rounded down to the nearest share (provided that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, the terms of such Adjusted Option shall provide for an
appropriate payment, upon exercise thereof, of cash in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Class B Common Stock lost due to such rounding), at a price
per share equal to (x) the exercise price for the shares of Company Common
Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by
(y) the Option Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be
rounded up to the nearest cent; and provided, further, that the adjustments
provided herein with respect to any Company Stock Options, whether or not
such Company Stock Options are "incentive stock options" as defined
in Section 422 of the Code, shall be and are intended to be effected in a
manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and Section 409A
of the Code and (II) with respect to the stock options that are deliverable
in connection with the exercise of any Adjusted Option that has a "reload"
feature, such stock options shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with
the foregoing.

 

 

(b) If the Parent Approvals are obtained, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or, if appropriate or required, any committee or other entity or
person administering the Company Stock Plans, as well as any required subset
of the Board of Directors) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions as may be required to adjust the terms of all outstanding Company
RSUs (as defined below) granted under any of the Company Stock Plans to
provide that, at the Effective Time, each Company RSU outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including each Company RSU outstanding under the
Senior Management Stock Deferral Plan) shall be deemed to constitute a
restricted stock unit (an "Adjusted RSU") with respect to, on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Company RSU (except as otherwise
provided on Section 2.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter), the number of
shares of Parent Class B Stock equal to the product of (1) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable with respect to such Company RSU
(including "performance stock" to be issued thereunder) and (2) the Option
Exchange Ratio; provided that any fractional shares of Parent Class B Stock
resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest share
(provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of such Adjusted RSU
shall provide for an appropriate payment, upon delivery of shares thereunder,
of cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Class B Common Stock lost
due to such rounding) and the adjustments provided herein with respect to any
Company RSUs shall be and are intended to be effected in a manner which is
consistent with Section 409A of the Code.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If the Parent Approvals are obtained, and to the extent the actions
described in Section 2.5(f) are not taken because of the proviso thereto, the
Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate or required, any
committee or other entity or person administering the Company Stock Plans, as
well as any required subset of the Board of Directors) shall adopt such
resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to adjust the
terms of all outstanding Company Restricted Shares (as defined below) granted
under any of the Company Stock Plans to provide that, at the Effective Time,
each award of Company Restricted Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such award, an award of restricted shares
of Parent Class B Stock ("Adjusted Restricted Shares") covering a number of
shares of Parent Class B Stock equal to the product of (1) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock underlying such award and (2) the Option
Exchange Ratio; provided that any resulting fractional shares of Parent Class
B Stock shall be rounded down to the nearest share (provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of such award of Adjusted Restricted
Shares shall provide for an appropriate payment, promptly following the
Effective Time, of cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Class B
Stock lost due to such rounding) and the adjustments provided herein with
respect to any Company Restricted Shares shall be and are intended to
be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 409A of the Code.

 

 

(d) The Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate or required,
any committee or other entity or person administering the Company Stock Plans
(as defined below)) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions
as may be required to provide that the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, the 1996
Stock Incentive Plan, the Non-Employee Directors' Stock Plan, the Senior
Management Stock Deferral Plan and any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of the capital
stock of the Company or any subsidiary (collectively, the "Company Stock
Plans") shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall
ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in any of the Company
Stock Plans shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity securities
of the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or the Surviving Entity.

 

 

(e) If the Parent Approvals are obtained, as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form, including
with respect to Adjusted Options, Adjusted Restricted Shares or Adjusted RSUs
held by persons who, immediately following the Effective Time, are not
employees of the Surviving Entity) registering a number of shares of Parent
Class B Stock equal to the number of shares subject to the Adjusted Options,
Adjusted Restricted Shares and the Adjusted RSUs. Any such registration
statement shall be kept effective (and the prospectus or prospectuses
required thereby shall be kept current) as long as any Adjusted Options,
Adjusted Restricted Shares or Adjusted RSUs remain outstanding. If the Parent
Approvals are obtained, the Adjusted Options, Adjusted Restricted Shares and
Adjusted RSUs shall be obligations of Parent following the Effective Time. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver
to holders of Adjusted Options, Adjusted Restricted Shares and Adjusted
RSUs appropriate notices setting forth the terms of such awards.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) The Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate or required,
any committee or other entity or person administering the Company Stock
Plans, as well as any required subset of the Board of Directors) shall adopt
such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to cause all
Company Restricted Shares to be vested no later than 10 days prior to the
Closing Date, provided that no such vesting shall be required to the extent
it would result in a breach of any Company Stock Plan or award agreement
thereunder or any applicable law or adverse tax consequences to the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of such Company Restricted Shares.

ARTICLE III 

 

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

 

Section 3.1 Corporate Organization. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
(other than with respect to the Company's due organization, valid existence
and good standing) as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or when aggregated with all other such
failures, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on the Company
("Company Material Adverse Effect"). The copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company (the "Company Charter" and "Company
Bylaws"), as most recently filed with the Company's SEC Documents (as defined
below), are true, complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect
as of the date of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term
"Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to the Company, on the one
hand, or Parent, on the other hand, a material adverse effect on (i) the
ability of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, to consummate the Merger, or (ii) the business, results of
operations or financial condition of such party and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, except to the extent such material adverse effect under this
clause (ii) results from (A) any changes in general United States or global
economic conditions, (B) any changes in conditions generally affecting any of
the industries in which such party and its subsidiaries operate, except to
the extent such changes in conditions have a disproportionate effect on such
party or its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to others in such
industries, (C) any decline in the market price of the common stock of such
party, (D) regulatory, legislative or political conditions or securities,
credit, financial or other capital markets conditions, in each case in the
United States or any foreign jurisdiction, except to the extent such
conditions have a disproportionate effect on such party and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, relative to others in the industries in which such party
and any of its subsidiaries operate, (E) any failure, in and of itself, by
such party to meet any internal or published projections,
forecasts, estimates or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings or other
financial or operating metrics for any period (it being understood that the
facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such failure may be
deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there
has been or will be a Material Adverse Effect), (F) the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the public announcement or pendency of the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the impact thereof on the relationships, contractual or otherwise,
of such party or any of its subsidiaries with employees, labor unions,
customers, suppliers or partners, (G) any change in applicable law,
regulation or GAAP (as defined below) (or authoritative interpretations
thereof), (H) geopolitical conditions, the outbreak or escalation of
hostilities, any acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, or any escalation or
worsening of any such acts of war, sabotage or terrorism threatened or
underway as of the date of this Agreement, except to the extent such
conditions or events have a disproportionate effect on such party and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to others in the industries in
which such party and any of its subsidiaries operate or (I) any hurricane,
tornado, flood, earthquake or other natural disaster, except to the extent
such events have a disproportionate effect on such party and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to others in the industries in which
such party and any of its subsidiaries operate. For purposes of analyzing
whether any state of facts, change, development, effect, occurrence or
condition has resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect, Parent and
Merger Sub will not be deemed to have knowledge of any state of facts,
change, development, effect, occurrence or condition relating to the Company
or its subsidiaries unless it is disclosed in the Company's SEC Documents or
the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined below). As used in this Agreement,
the word "subsidiary" when used with respect to any party means any
corporation, partnership or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, (i) of which at least a majority of the securities or other
interests having by their terms voting power to elect a majority of the board
of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly beneficially
owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its subsidiaries,
or by such party and one or more of its subsidiaries, or (ii) that would be
required to be consolidated in such party's financial statements under
generally accepted accounting principles as adopted (whether or not yet
effective) in the United States.

Section 3.2 Capitalization.

 

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 600,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, 25,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company $0.01 Par Value
Preferred Stock") and 50,000,000 shares of Class A preferred stock, par value

Company included in the SEC Documents (the "SEC Financial Statements") comply
as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have

reference therein, the "Recent SEC Documents"), or (v) as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. If,
at any time from the date hereof and until the Effective Time, the Company
shall obtain knowledge of any material facts that would require supplementing
or amending any of the foregoing documents in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, or to comply with applicable laws, such amendment or supplement
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company. The management of the Company has (i)

controls to be designed under its supervision, to ensure that material
information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to the management of the Company by others within those

affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that

agreement maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to by

so qualified as to form and the Company is aware of no event occurring after
the date of such determination that would adversely affect such

Section 4975, 4976, or 4980B of the Code or other liability with respect to

respect to any employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

 

 

(c) Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,

execution, delivery and performance by Merger Sub of this Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly
authorized and approved by National Indemnity Company, a Nebraska corporation
and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and the sole member of
Merger Sub. No other corporate or limited liability company action, as
applicable, on the part of Parent or Merger Sub is necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation by them of the Merger. All corporate or limited liability
company actions, as applicable required to be taken by the Boards of
Directors of Parent and the sole member of Merger Sub to approve the holding
of a special meeting of stockholders of Parent and the filing of a
preliminary proxy statement with respect to, and the recommendation to the
stockholders of Parent to vote in favor of, the Parent Class B Stock
Authorization and the Parent Class B Stock Split have been taken. The
approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Parent
Stock, and the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Parent Class B Stock, voting as a separate class, are the only
votes of the holders of any class or series of the securities of Parent and
its subsidiaries necessary to approve the Parent Class B Stock Authorization
and the Parent Class B Stock Split. Subject to obtaining such approvals, the
approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Parent
Stock is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
securities of Parent and its subsidiaries necessary to approve the Parent
Equity Plan. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent
and Merger Sub, and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the Company, is a valid and binding obligation of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of them in accordance with
its terms, except that such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or (b) general principles
of equity.

sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of Parent or obligating Parent to issue,
grant, extend or enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right,
commitment, agreement, derivative contract, forward sale contract or

affected, except, in the case of clause (ii) above, for such violations,
conflicts, breaches, defaults, losses, terminations of rights thereof,
accelerations or Lien creations which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 4.5 SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. Parent and each of its
subsidiaries that is required to file any registration statement, prospectus,
report, schedule, form, statement or other document with the SEC, has filed
all required registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC
(collectively, and in each case including all exhibits, schedules and
amendments thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, the
"Parent SEC Documents") since December 31, 2008. As of their respective
dates, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to
such Parent SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents (including
any and all financial statements included therein) as of such dates contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the
Parent SEC Documents (the "Parent SEC Financial Statements") comply as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Since
December 31, 2008, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required, if known, to be reflected or reserved
against on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent prepared in accordance with
GAAP except (i) as and to the extent set forth on the audited balance sheet
of Parent and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 (including the notes
thereto) included in the Parent SEC Documents, (ii) as incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) as incurred after
December 31, 2008 in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice, (iv) as described in the Parent SEC Documents filed since December
31, 2008 (such SEC Documents, excluding any exhibits thereto or documents
incorporated by reference therein, the "Parent Recent SEC Documents"), or (v)
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
obtain knowledge of any material facts that would require supplementing or
amending any of the foregoing documents in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, or to comply with applicable laws, such amendment or supplement
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to
the stockholders of Parent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in the
Parent Recent SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, since December
31, 2008, Parent has conducted its businesses only in the ordinary course and
in a manner consistent with past practice and, since such date, there has not
been any event that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have in the future a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

 

Section 4.7 Broker's Fees. Neither Parent nor any of its officers or
directors, nor Merger Sub nor any of its officers, on behalf of Parent or
Merger Sub, has employed any financial advisor, broker or finder in a manner
that would result in any liability of the Company for any broker's fees,
commissions or finder's fees in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or that would result in any reduction of the
consideration payable to the stockholders of the Company.

 

 

Section 4.8 Merger Sub's Operation. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and has not
engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. All of the issued
and outstanding membership interests of Merger Sub have been validly issued,
are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned as of the date hereof, and
will be owned, as of the Closing Date, either directly or indirectly, by
Parent, free and clear of any Liens.

Section 4.9 Parent or Merger Sub Information. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with
the SEC, and at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii)
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it or any amendment or supplement is
mailed to holders of the shares of Company Common Stock and at the time of
the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no representation
or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4.

 

 

Section 4.10 Financing. Parent and Merger Sub collectively have and will
have at the Effective Time sufficient funds to pay the cash portion of the
Merger Consideration for all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
converted into cash pursuant to the Merger, to perform Parent's and Merger
Sub's obligations under this Agreement and to pay all fees and expenses
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement payable by them.

 

 

Section 4.11 Stock Ownership. As of the date hereof, except as disclosed
in Parent's filings with the SEC, neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries beneficially owns any shares of Company Common Stock. Prior to
the date of this Agreement, Parent has represented to the Company that the
fair market value of the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common
Stock is greater than the consideration per share of Company Common Stock
(including brokerage commissions and soliciting dealer's fees) paid by Parent
or any of its subsidiaries in acquiring any shares of Company Common Stock,
whether before or after Parent became an "Interested Stockholder" as defined
in the Article Sixth of the Company Charter.

 

 

Section 4.12 Certain Additional Representations. Parent has consulted
Munger, Tolles and Olson, LLP, counsel to Parent, and believes that it will be
able to give representations reasonably necessary for tax counsel to Parent
and tax counsel to the Company to be able to render the opinions referred to
in Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(c).

Section 5.2 No Solicitation.

 

 

(a) The Company shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with
any parties that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover Proposal (as
hereinafter defined) and shall seek to have returned to the Company any
confidential information that has been provided in any such discussions or
negotiations. From the date hereof, the Company shall not, nor shall it
permit any of its subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of
its officers, directors or employees or any affiliate, investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by
it or any of its subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information
which has not been previously publicly disseminated), or take any other
action designed to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal
which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover
Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that if, following the receipt of a
Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined) or a proposal which is reasonably
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal that in either case was unsolicited
and made after the date hereof in circumstances not otherwise involving a
breach of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after considering applicable provisions of state law and after
consultation with outside counsel, that a failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under
applicable law, the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal
and subject to compliance with Section 5.2(c), (A) request information from
the party making such Takeover Proposal for the sole purpose of the Board
of Directors of the Company informing itself about the Takeover Proposal that
has been made and the party that made it, (B) furnish information with
respect to the Company to the party making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement, provided that (1) such confidentiality
agreement may not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to
negotiate with the Company and (2) the Company advises Parent of all such
nonpublic information delivered to such person concurrently with its delivery
to the requesting party, and (C) participate in negotiations with such party
regarding such Takeover Proposal. It is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any executive officer,
director or investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.2(a) by the Company. The Company agrees not to waive or fail to
enforce any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which
it is a party relating to a potential or actual Takeover Proposal.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Except as expressly permitted in this Section 5.2(b), neither the Board
of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the approval, determination of advisability, or recommendation by
such Board of Directors or such committee of this Agreement, the Merger, and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) approve, determine to be
advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, determine to be
advisable, or recommend, any Takeover Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to
enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement")
related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a customary confidentiality
agreement referred to in clause (B) of the proviso to Section 5.2(a)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith, in response to a Superior Proposal that
was unsolicited and made after the date hereof in circumstances not otherwise
involving a breach of this Agreement, after considering applicable provisions
of state law and after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's
stockholders under applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Company may
(subject to compliance with this sentence and to compliance with Sections
5.2(a) and 5.2(c)) (x) withdraw or modify its approval, determination of
advisability, or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger, and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or (y) approve, determine to be advisable,
or recommend a Superior Proposal, or (z) cause the Company to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement, provided, however, that any actions described in
clause (x), (y) or (z) may be taken only at a time that is after the second
business day following Parent's receipt of written notice from the Company
advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a
Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, identifying the person making such Superior Proposal
and providing notice of the determination of the Board of Directors of the
Company of what actions described in clause (x), (y) or (z) the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined to take, and further provided, that
the action described in clause (z) may be taken only upon compliance by the
Company with Section 7.1(c)(ii) and Section 7.3. In addition,
and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board
of Directors of the Company may at any time (other than in connection with
a Takeover Proposal) withdraw or modify its approval, determination
of advisability, or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger, and the
other transactions contemplated hereby in the event it determines in good
faith, after considering applicable provisions of state law and after
consultation with outside counsel, that any such withdrawal or modification
of its approval, determination of advisability or recommendation is required
in order for the Company's Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law, provided that the
Company has provided to Parent five (5) business days' prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such action and specifying, in
reasonable detail, the reasons for such action.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.2(a)
and 5.2(b), the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of
any request for confidential information in connection with a Takeover
Proposal or of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
such request or the Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person making
such request or Takeover Proposal and shall keep Parent promptly advised of
all significant developments which could reasonably be expected to culminate
in the Board of Directors of the Company withdrawing, modifying or amending
its recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or in exercising any of its other rights
under Section 5.2(a) or (b).

 

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or Section 5.4 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders; provided, however,
neither the Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall, except as in accordance with Section 5.2(b), withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its approval, determination of
advisability or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or approve, determine to be advisable, or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve, determine to be advisable, or
recommend, a Takeover Proposal.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

 

(i) "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person
(other than Parent and its subsidiaries, affiliates, and representatives)
relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 10% or more of
the consolidated assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries) of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 10% or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company, or any merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written offer from any person
(other than Parent and its subsidiaries, affiliates and representatives) for
a direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 50% or more of the
consolidated assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries) of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 50% or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 50% or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company, or any merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (A)
which, considering all relevant factors, is more favorable to the Company and
its stockholders than the Merger, and (B) for which the third party has
demonstrated that the financing for such offer is fully committed or is
reasonably likely to be obtained, in each case as determined by the Board
of Directors in its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of
independent financial advisors and outside counsel).

 

 

Section 5.3 Preparation of Form S-4 and Proxy Statement; Stockholders'
Meeting.

 

 

(a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as
a prospectus. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts as promptly as practicable (and after consultation with the other) to
respond to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 and to have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. The Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.

 

 

(b) The Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance
with applicable law:

 

 

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this
Agreement (the "Special Meeting") as soon as practicable following the date
hereof;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

31  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) include in the Proxy Statement (1) the recommendation of the Board that
stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of the Merger and
the adoption of this Agreement, unless such recommendation has been
withdrawn, or as such recommendation has been modified or amended, in each
case in accordance with Section 5.2, and (2) the opinions of Evercore

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its

(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other party may

Section 5.7 Further Assurances.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use all reasonable
best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper
or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be
imposed on such party or its subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, as
promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other

subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions
of any such consent, authorization, order or approval.

 

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and

parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and using all
reasonable efforts to defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking

that would materially affect its or their operation) of any portion of their
respective businesses or assets, (ii) divest, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of any portion of its or their respective businesses or assets, (iii)

Section 5.8 Indemnification.

 

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes such prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") against (i)
any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, fines, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the
indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out
of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries whether pertaining to any action or omission
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted
or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time ("Indemnified
Liabilities"), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part
on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that, in the case of
Merger Sub and the Surviving Entity, such indemnification shall only be to
the fullest extent a corporation is permitted under the DGCL to indemnify
its own directors and officers, and in the case of Parent, such
indemnification shall not be limited by the DGCL but such indemnification
shall not be applicable to any claims made against the Indemnified Parties
(A) if a judgment or other final adjudication established that their acts or
omissions were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and
deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so deliberated
or (B) arising out of, based upon or attributable to the gaining in fact of
any financial profit or other advantage to which they were not legally
entitled. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Surviving Entity, as the case may be,
will pay all expenses of each Indemnified Party in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to the fullest extent a
corporation is permitted by law to advance such expenses upon receipt of an
undertaking of the kind described in Section 145(e) of the DGCL. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation is brought against any Indemnified Party (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them and reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Merger
Sub, (ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received, and (iii) Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Entity to, use all reasonable efforts to assist in
the vigorous defense of any such matter, provided that none of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Entity shall be liable for any settlement of any claim
effected without its written consent, which consent, however, shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 5.8, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Entity (but the failure so to notify an indemnifying party
shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section
5.8 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party), and
shall deliver to Merger Sub and the Surviving Entity an undertaking of the
kind described in Section 145(e) of the DGCL. The Indemnified Parties as a
group may retain only one law firm (in addition to local counsel in each
applicable jurisdiction if reasonably required) to represent them with
respect to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of
professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the
positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Successors. In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then and in either such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the continuing or surviving entity or transferee, as appropriate, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

 

 

(c) Survival of Indemnification. To the fullest extent not prohibited by
law, from and after the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification as of
the date hereof in favor of the directors, officers and fiduciaries of the
Company and its subsidiaries with respect to their activities as such prior
to the Effective Time, as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation and bylaws or comparable documents in effect on the date
hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time, provided
that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-
year period, all such rights to indemnification in respect of such claim or
claims shall continue until the final disposition thereof.

 

 

Section 5.9 Employee Benefit Plans. For purposes of all employee benefit
plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and other employment agreements,
arrangements and policies of the Surviving Entity under which an employee's
benefits depends, in whole or in part, on length of service, credit will be
given to current employees of the Company and its subsidiaries for service
with the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time,
provided that such crediting of service does not result in duplication
of benefits. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, honor in
accordance with their terms all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA) and the other Company Benefit Plans; provided, however, that
Parent or the Surviving Entity may amend, modify or terminate any individual
Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms and applicable law
(including obtaining the consent of the other parties to and beneficiaries of
such Company Benefit Plan to the extent required thereunder). For a period of
two years from the Closing Date, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall
provide, or cause to be provided, compensation and benefits to the employees
and former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Company
Employees") that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
compensation and benefits that are provided to the Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing
obligation shall not restrict Parent and the Surviving Entity from making
changes that (i) are consistent with changes currently planned or
contemplated by the Company, (ii) are in response to business conditions
which may exist at the time of such changes or (iii) are collectively
bargained for. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries shall
not, after the Effective Time, provide any form of equity-based compensation,
including, without limitation, options to purchase shares of capital stock in
the Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries; provided that any equity-
based compensation provided by the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to
the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
taken into account in determining whether the compensation and benefits
provided by Parent and the Surviving Entity are less favorable than those
provided by the Company for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence.

 

 

Section 5.10 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Entity with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense
of, Parent.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5.11 Pre-Closing Restructuring. Parent will make (or not make) or
cause to be made (or not be made) such entity classification elections under
the Code, convert any corporate entities into LLCs under state corporate law,
or do such other restructuring, as may be necessary to enable the Merger to
be treated as a merger into a corporation wholly owned by Parent for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

 

 

Section 5.12 [Intentionally omitted]

 

 

Section 5.13 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for listing on the NYSE, subject to notice of issuance, prior to the Closing
Date.

 

 

Section 5.14 Parent Class B Stock Split and Stock Option Plan Approval.

 

 

(a) Parent, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, in accordance with
applicable law:

 

 

(i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
stockholders, as soon as practicable following the date hereof, for the
purpose of considering and voting upon the approval of (i) an amendment to
Parent's certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized
shares of Parent Class B Stock and make other appropriate changes (the
"Parent Class B Stock Authorization") in order to permit and effectuate a
50-for-1 split of Parent Class B Stock (the "Parent Class B Stock Split"),
and (ii) the adoption of a Parent equity plan (the "Parent Equity Plan") that
will authorize the issuance of Adjusted Options, Adjusted Restricted Shares
and Adjusted RSUs as contemplated by Section 2.5 hereof (the "Parent Equity
Plan Approval" and together with the Parent Class B Stock Authorization, the
"Parent Approvals"); and

 

 

(ii) include in the related proxy statement the recommendation of the Board
that stockholders of Parent vote in favor of the Parent Approvals.

 

 

(b) If the Parent Approvals are not obtained pursuant to Section 5.14(a)(i),
Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree on and implement a mechanism or
mechanisms (i) to ensure that (A) the Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and
Company Restricted Shares are treated in a manner that is reasonably
comparable from the point of view of the holders to the treatment that would
have resulted had the Parent Approvals been obtained and (B) the condition
set forth in Section 6.2(e), if not waived, is satisfied and (ii) that do not
violate any legal or contractual obligations of the Company relating to such
Company Stock Options, Company RSUs or Company Restricted Shares.

based on the existence of such Takeover Proposal (whether or not modified
after it was first made), and such Takeover Proposal (whether or not modified
after it was first made) is consummated within one (1) year of
such termination or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii), or is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(c)(ii), then the Company shall pay to Parent on the date of such
termination, or in the case of subclause (i) upon such consummation, a
termination fee equal to $264,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"), payable by
wire transfer of same day funds. In the event that the Termination Fee is
payable to Parent, the Company shall, together with the payment of the
Termination Fee, reimburse Parent for any SEC filing fees previously paid by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.
The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. The fee arrangement contemplated hereby shall be
paid pursuant to this Section 7.3 regardless of any alleged breach by Parent
of its obligations hereunder, provided, that no payment made by the Company
pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall operate or be construed as a waiver by the
Company of any breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or of any
rights of the Company in respect thereof. The Termination Fee, if paid, shall
be credited against any damages recovered by Parent or Merger Sub from the
Company arising from a breach of this Agreement by the Company. Solely for
purposes of this Section 7.3, the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 5.2(e) except that references to
"10%" in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" in Section 5.2(e) shall be
deemed to be references to "50%".

Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after any vote of the stockholders of the Company
contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto at any time

instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time.

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

 

Section 8.6 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the instruments referred
to herein): (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and (b) except as provided in Section
5.8, is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies hereunder. Section 5.8 is intended for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties.

 

 

Section 8.7 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as a whole, are not
affected in a manner materially adverse to any party hereto.

Section 8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to

upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their

after reasonable inquiry of the executive officers of the Company or Parent,
as the case may be.

 

 

Section 8.11 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached and that any breach of this Agreement could not be
adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Any proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, shall be brought in any court of the State of Delaware, and each
party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in
any such proceeding, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to
venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the
proceeding shall be heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees
not to bring any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, in any other
court.
