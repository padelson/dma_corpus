AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is made and
entered into as of December 14, 2006 (the "AGREEMENT"), by and among Intuit
inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Elan Acquisition Corporation, a
Nevada corporation and A wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"),
and Electronic Clearing House, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the
"COMPANY").   RECITALS   WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company have each determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.   WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of the Company (the "BOARD") has unanimously (i)
determined that the Merger (as defined in SECTION 1.1 hereof) is advisable
and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders,
and (ii) approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "TRANSACTIONS"), and (iii) resolved,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to recommend the
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company.   WHEREAS,
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and
material inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into this Agreement,
all executive officers and directors of the Company and all of
their respective affiliates, in their capacity as stockholders of the
Company, are entering into voting agreements in substantially the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the "COMPANY VOTING AGREEMENTS"), pursuant to
which each such stockholder has agreed, among other things, to vote his, her
or its Shares (as defined in SECTION 1.6(A) hereof) in favor of the
Merger.   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as
a condition and material inducement to Parent\'s willingness to enter into
this Agreement, (i) the individuals listed on SCHEDULE I attached hereto are
entering into non-competition agreements with Parent (the "NON-COMPETITION
AGREEMENTS"), and (ii) the individuals listed on SCHEDULE II attached hereto
(the "KEY EMPLOYEES") are entering into offer letters with Parent.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and representations
set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time
(as defined in SECTION 1.2 hereof) and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Nevada
Revised Statutes ("NEVADA LAW"), Merger Sub shall be merged   
1    with and into the Company (the "MERGER"), the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation. The Company, as the surviving corporation after the
Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION."   1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME; CLOSING. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger
to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "ARTICLES OF MERGER")
with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in accordance with the
relevant provisions of Nevada Law (the time of such filing (or such later
time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and specified in
the Articles of Merger) being the "EFFECTIVE TIME") as soon as practicable on
or after the Closing Date (as herein defined). Unless the context otherwise
requires, the term "AGREEMENT" as used herein refers collectively to this
Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may be amended from time to time in
accordance with the terms hereof) and the Articles of Merger. The closing of
the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of O\'Melveny and
Myers LLP, Embarcadero Center West, 275 Battery Street, Suite 2600, San
Francisco, California, at a time and date to be specified by the parties
hereto, which shall be no later than the second business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI hereof
(other than those conditions, which by their terms, are to be satisfied or
waived on the Closing Date), or at such other time, date and location as the
parties hereto agree in writing (the "CLOSING DATE").   1.3 EFFECT OF THE
MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided
in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Nevada Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all of the assets, properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS OF SURVIVING CORPORATION.   (a)
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. As of the Effective Time, by  virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Merger Sub  or the Company, the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving  Corporation shall be amended and
restated to read the same as the  Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior  to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended
in accordance with  Nevada Law and such Articles of Incorporation; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that  as of the Effective Time the Articles of Incorporation shall
provide  that the name of the Surviving Corporation is "Electronic Clearing 
House, Inc."   (b) BYLAWS. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger  and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the Company,
the  Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to 
read the same as the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately  prior to
the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance  with Nevada Law,
the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving    2     Corporation and
such Bylaws; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all references in  such Bylaws to Merger
Sub shall be deemed to refer to "Electronic  Clearing House, Inc."   1.5
DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF SURVIVING CORPORATION.   (a) DIRECTORS. The

Merger Sub as of immediately  prior to the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly  elected or appointed and qualified.   (b)

officers of Merger Sub as of immediately prior  to the Effective Time, until

1.6 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities, the following shall occur:   (a) CONVERSION OF
SHARES. Each share of Company Common Stock  (as defined in Section 2.3(a)
hereof), including the associated right  (the "RIGHTS") to purchase one one-
hundredth of a share of Series A  Junior Participating Preferred Stock
("SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK"), or  in certain circumstances Company Common
Stock, pursuant to the Amended  and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of
January 29, 2003 (the "RIGHTS  AGREEMENT"), by and between the Company and
OTR, Inc., as Rights Agent,  (the "SHARES") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the  Effective Time (other than any Shares to be
canceled pursuant to  SECTION 1.6(B) hereof and any Dissenting Shares (as
defined in SECTION  1.7 hereof)), will be canceled and extinguished and
automatically  converted into the right to receive, upon surrender of the
certificate  representing such Share in the manner provided in SECTION 1.8
hereof  (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon 
delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided  in
SECTION 1.10 hereof), cash, without interest, in an amount equal to  Eighteen
Dollars and Seventy Five Cents ($18.75) per Share (the "MERGER 
CONSIDERATION").   (b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY AND PARENT-OWNED SHARES.
Each  Share held by the Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
direct  or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or of Parent 
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and  extinguished
without any conversion thereof.   (c) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each
share of common stock,  par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "MERGER
SUB COMMON  STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time  shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and 
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the 
Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares  of
Merger    3     Sub Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time  shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of
the  Surviving Corporation.   (d) EQUITY AWARDS. The Company shall, prior
to the Effective  Time, take such action, adopt such amendments, and obtain
all such  consents, as shall be required: (i) as to any Company Stock Options
(as  defined in Section 2.3(a)), shares of Company Restricted Stock (as 
defined in Section 2.3(a)) (including those shares issued pursuant to  the
acceleration of Long-Term Incentive Restricted Stock Grants (as  defined in
Section 2.3(a)) as a result of this Section 1.6(d)),  Long-Term Incentive
Restricted Stock Grants and Long-Term Incentive  Phantom Stock Grants (as
defined in Section 2.3(a)) that are  outstanding and unvested immediately
prior to the Effective Time, to  cause such Company Stock Options, shares of
Company Restricted Stock,  Long-Term Incentive Restricted Stock Grants and
Long-Term Incentive  Phantom Stock Grants to be fully vested immediately
prior to the  Effective Time; (ii) as to any Long-Term Incentive Restricted
Stock  Grants that are accelerated as a result of this Section 1.6(d), to 
issue shares of Company Restricted Stock in respect thereof upon such 
acceleration; (iii) as to any shares of Company Restricted Stock  (including
those issued pursuant to the acceleration of Long-Term  Incentive Restricted
Stock Grants as a result of this Section 1.6(d)),  to cause such shares to be
treated in accordance with Section 1.6(a) at  the Effective Time; and (iv) to
cancel, immediately prior to the  Effective Time, all then-outstanding
Company Stock Options and  Long-Term Incentive Phantom Stock Grants such that
the holder of any  such Company Stock Option or Long-Term Incentive Phantom
Stock Grant  shall have no further interest in such Company Stock Option or 
Long-Term Incentive Phantom Stock Grants, or right in respect thereof  or
with respect thereto, other than the right to receive such cash 
consideration as determined pursuant to the next three sentences. With 
respect to each Company Stock Option that has a per share exercise  price
that is less than the Merger Consideration and is so cancelled,  the holder
of such Company Stock Option shall be entitled to receive  for such Company
Stock Option (the "OPTION CONSIDERATION") (subject to  any applicable
withholding tax) cash equal to the product of (A) the  number of shares of
Company Common Stock as to which the portion of the  Company Stock Option
that is so cancelled could be exercised,  multiplied by (B) the Merger
Consideration less the per share exercise  price of such portion of the
Company Stock Option. In the case of a  Company Stock Option having a per
share exercise price equal to or  greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Stock Option shall  be cancelled without the payment of cash or
issuance of other  securities in respect thereof. With respect to each Long-
Term Incentive  Phantom Stock Grant, the holder of such Long-Term Incentive
Phantom  Stock Grant shall be entitled to receive for such Long-Term
Incentive  Phantom Stock Grant (the "PHANTOM STOCK CONSIDERATION") (subject
to any  applicable withholding tax) cash equal to the product of (A) the
number  of shares of phantom stock subject to such Long-Term Incentive
Phantom  Stock Grant, multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration. As soon
as  reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver 
to the Surviving Corporation an amount equal to the sum of the  aggregate
Option Consideration and the aggregate Phantom Stock  Consideration payable
to holders of Company Stock Options and Long-Term  Incentive Phantom Stock
Grants that were converted into the right to  receive Option Consideration
and Phantom Stock Consideration pursuant  to this SECTION 1.6(D), and the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly  deliver the Option Consideration   
4     and Phantom Stock Consideration to such holders of Company Stock 
Options and Long-Term Incentive Phantom Stock Grants.   1.7 DISSENTING
SHARES.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the 
contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held  by a stockholder
of the Company who has properly exercised his, her or  its dissenter\'s
rights under Nevada Law (the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall  not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration  pursuant to SECTION
1.6(A), but, instead, such shares shall be  converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be  determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to  and subject to the requirements of Nevada
Law. If any such holder shall  have failed to perfect, or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost,  his, her or its right to dissent from the
Merger under Nevada Law, each  share of such holder\'s Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be deemed  to have been converted, as of the Effective Time,
into the right to  receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon  surrender, in the manner provided in SECTION 1.8 hereof, of
the  certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares. The 
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice or demands  for
appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by  the
Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and  proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under Nevada Law. The  Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,  make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to  settle or settle any such
demands.   1.8 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) PAYING AGENT. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall  select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to  act as agent (the "PAYING AGENT") for the
holders of Shares to receive  the funds to which holders of Shares shall
become entitled pursuant to  SECTION 1.6(A). As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective  Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause Merger
Sub to deposit, with the  Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Shares, cash in an  amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration. The  deposit made by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be,
pursuant to  this SECTION 1.8(A) is hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE
FUND."  If such funds are insufficient to make the payments contemplated by 
SECTION 1.6(A), Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be  deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is  equal to the
deficiency in the amount funds required to make such  payment. Parent shall
instruct the Paying Agent to cause the Exchange  Fund to be (i) held for the
benefit of the holders of the Shares, and  (ii) applied promptly to make the
payments provided for in SECTION  1.6(A) in accordance with this SECTION 1.8.
The Exchange Fund shall be  invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent.   (b) PAYMENT PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably practicable  after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail  to each
holder of record (as    5    of the Effective Time) of a certificate or
certificates (the  "CERTIFICATES"), which immediately prior to the Effective
Time  represented the outstanding Shares converted into the right to
receive  the Merger Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary
form  (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss  and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the 
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and any required  bond in
accordance with SECTION 1.10) to the Paying Agent and shall  contain such
other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may  reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the  surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration  (which instructions shall include
provisions for payment of the Merger  Consideration to a person other than
the person in whose name the  surrendered Certificate is registered on the
transfer books of the  Company, subject to receipt of appropriate
documentation and payment of  any applicable taxes). Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation  (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
together with any required bond  in accordance with SECTION 1.10) to the
Paying Agent or to such other  agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such  letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in  accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such 
Certificates formerly representing the Shares shall be entitled to  receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, and the  Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so  surrendered, outstanding
Certificates shall be deemed from and after  the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, to evidence only the  right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Promptly following surrender  of any such Certificates, the
Paying Agent shall deliver to the record  holders thereof, without interest,
the Merger Consideration.   (c) PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO UNSURRENDERED
SHARES; NO  LIABILITY. At any time following the one (1) year anniversary of
the  Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require 
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund that 
remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares (including, without  limitation,
all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent  in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such  holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject  to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar laws) only as general  creditors thereof with respect to
any Merger Consideration that may be  payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent,
the Surviving  Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder
of a  Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Share 
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or  other
similar law.   (d) TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If the payment of the Merger 
Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose  name
the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered,  it will be
a condition of payment that the Certificates so surrendered  be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer  (including without
limitation, if requested by Parent or the Paying  Agent, a medallion
guarantee), and that the persons requesting such  payment will have paid to
Parent or any agent designated by it any  transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger  Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of the  Certificates surrendered, or established to the
reasonable satisfaction  of Parent or any agent designated by it that such
tax has been paid or  is not applicable.    6     (e) REQUIRED
WITHHOLDING. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and  the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from  any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this  Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Shares or Company Stock  Options such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld  therefrom under the Code (as defined in SECTION
2.11(A) hereof) or  under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or
under any  other applicable Legal Requirement (as defined in SECTION 2.3(A) 
hereof). To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such 
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as  having
been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise  have been paid
(in respect of which Parent, the Paying Agent or the  Surviving Company, as
the case may be, made such deductions and  withholdings).   (f)
ADJUSTMENTS. If during the period from the date of this  Agreement through
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding  shares of Company Common
Stock or the shares of Company Common Stock  issuable upon conversion,
exercise or exchange of securities  convertible, exercisable or exchangeable
into or for shares of Company  Common Stock, shall occur by reason of any
reclassification,  recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment  of shares of Company Common Stock, or any similar transaction,
or any  stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the 
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such 
change.   1.9 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN SHARES. Payment of the
Merger Consideration shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Shares, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this ARTICLE I.   1.10 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the
event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such reasonable and
customary amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   1.11 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION; FURTHER ACTION. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the
officers and directors of the Company and Merger Sub will take all such
lawful and reasonably necessary action.    7     ARTICLE II 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   The Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject only to exceptions disclosed
in writing in the disclosure schedule supplied by the Company to Parent dated
as of the date hereof and certified by a duly authorized officer of the
Company (the "COMPANY SCHEDULE"), as follows:   2.1 ORGANIZATION AND
QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES.   (a) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries
is a corporation  duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of  the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite
corporate  power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and
properties  and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and
as  proposed by the Company to be conducted. Each of the Company and its 
subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants,  authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates,  approvals and orders
("APPROVALS") necessary to own, lease and operate  the properties it purports
to own, operate or lease and to carry on its  business as it is now being
conducted and as proposed by the Company to  be conducted. except where any
failure to possess such Approvals would  not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a  Material Adverse Effect.   (b)
The Company has no subsidiaries except for the  corporations identified in
SECTION 2.1(B) of the Company Schedule.  SECTION 2.1(B) of the Company
Schedule also (i) sets forth the form of  ownership and percentage interest
of the Company in each of its  subsidiaries, (ii) to the extent that a
subsidiary set forth thereon is  not wholly owned by the Company, lists the
other persons or entities  who have an interest in such subsidiary and sets
forth the percentage  of each such interest, and (iii) identifies each of the
directors and  officers of each such subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any
of its  subsidiaries has agreed to make nor is obligated to make nor is
bound  by any written, oral or other agreement, contract, subcontract,
lease,  mortgage, indenture, understanding, arrangement, instrument, note, 
bond, option, warranty, purchase order, license, sublicense, insurance 
policy, benefit plan, permit, franchise or other instrument, obligation  or
commitment or undertaking of any nature (a "CONTRACT"), in effect as  of the
date hereof or as may hereafter be in effect under which it may  become
obligated to make, any future investment in or capital  contribution to any
other entity. Neither the Company nor any of its  subsidiaries directly or
indirectly owns any equity or similar interest  in or any interest
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for, any  equity or similar interest
in, any corporation, partnership, limited  liability company, joint venture
or other business, association or  entity.   (c) The Company and each of
its subsidiaries is duly qualified  to do business as a foreign corporation,
and is in good standing, under  the laws of all jurisdictions where the
character of the properties  owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its activities makes  such qualification necessary, except where failures to
be so qualified  and in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be  reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.    8     2.2 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS. The Company
has previously furnished to Parent (i) a complete and correct copy of its
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as amended to date (together, the
"COMPANY CHARTER DOCUMENTS") and (ii) the equivalent organizational documents
for each subsidiary of the Company, each as amended to date. The Company is
not in violation of any of the provisions of the Company Charter Documents,

and 407  of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 4975 of the Code
or  Section 408 of ERISA (or any administrative class exemption issued

are no actions, suits or claims pending, or, to the knowledge of  the
Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated (other than routine  claims for
benefits) against or with respect to any Company Employee  Plan or any
Employment Agreement or against the assets of any Company  Employee Plan.
Each Company Employee Plan can be    18     amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time,  without material liability
to Parent, Company or any of its Affiliates  (other than ordinary
administration expenses). There are no audits,  inquiries or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or  any Affiliates, threatened by
the IRS or DOL with respect to any  Company Employee Plan. The Company is not
subject to any material  penalty or tax with respect to any Company Employee
Plan under Title I  of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code. All
contributions,  reserves or premium payments required to be made or accrued
as of the  date hereof to the Company Employee Plans have been timely made
or  accrued. Each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in 
Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated since January 1, 2005  in

of the Code and no such plan has been materially modified  since October 3,

at that time sponsored, participated in, or  contributed to by any employer
other than the Company or an Affiliate.   (g) NO SEVERANCE OR POST-
EMPLOYMENT OBLIGATIONS. Except as set  forth on SECTION 2.11(G) of the
Company Schedule, no Company Employee  Plan provides for the payment of
severance or other benefits upon  termination of employment. No Company
Employee Plan provides, or  reflects or represents any liability to provide
retiree health or other  welfare benefits to any person for any reason,
except as may be  required by COBRA or other applicable statute, and the
Company has no  expected liability or obligation as a result of
representations,  promises or contracts (whether in oral or written form) to

retiree health or other welfare benefits, except to the extent required  by

acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting,  distribution, increase
in benefits or obligation to fund  benefits with respect to any Employee.  
(ii) No payment or benefit which will or may be made  by the Company or its
Affiliates with respect to any Employee  or any other "disqualified

year and the most  recently completed fiscal year. To the knowledge of the
Company, no  executive or key employee of the Company has any plans to
terminate his  or her employment with the Company. All independent
contractors have  been properly classified as independent contractors for the
purposes of  federal and applicable state tax laws, laws applicable to
employee  benefits and other applicable law except to the extent such
failure  could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse 
Effect. SECTION 2.11(K) of the Company Schedule sets forth a list of  all
former consultants of the Company.   (l) LABOR. No work stoppage, labor

knowledge of the Company, threatened or  reasonably anticipated relating to
any labor, safety or discrimination  matters involving any Employee,
including, without limitation, charges  of unfair labor practices or

Company. Neither the Company nor any  of its subsidiaries has engaged in any
unfair labor practices within  the meaning of the National Labor Relations

amounts in connection with the WARN Act and all similar state  Legal
Requirements including applicable provisions of the California  Labor Code,
shall be the responsibility of the Company.   (o) SECTION 409A. Each Company
Employee Plan that is a  deferred compensation arrangement has been
identified as either being  exempt from Section 409A of the Code or as
subject to Section 409A of  the Code (and identified as either an account
balance plan or a  non-account balance plan, and equity plan or a severance

and  other service providers were made over Company Common Stock, have an 
exercise price that is at least equal to the fair market value of the

or in part, or is  being used in conjunction with any Public Software in a
manner which  would require that such software or Company Product be
disclosed or  distributed in source code form or made available in any form
at no  charge. For purposes of this Agreement, "PUBLIC SOFTWARE" means any 
software that contains, or is derived in any manner (in whole or in  part)
from, any software that is distributed as free software,  "shareware", open
source software or similar licensing or distribution  models, including

of the Company Schedule lists all IP  Licenses pursuant to which the Company
or any of its subsidiaries is  granted rights to any Intellectual Property of
a third party used in or  in connection with the business of the Company or
its subsidiaries  within the past three (3) years, except for non-negotiated
licenses of  generally commercially available software that have been
licensed by  the Company on standard terms and Public Software licenses set
forth on  SECTION 2.18(G) of the Company Schedule; SECTION 2.18(H)(II) of
the  Company Schedule lists all IP Licenses pursuant to which a third party 
is granted rights to any material Company Intellectual Property, except  for
agreements with Company\'s or its subsidiaries\' customers entered  into in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices  in the form
made available to Parent; and SECTION 2.18(H)(III) of the  Company Schedule
lists, for each Company Product, all Intellectual  Property incorporated in
or used in connection with such Company  Product that is not Company
Intellectual Property and the IP License  pursuant to which Company or any of
its subsidiaries acquired the right  to use such Intellectual Property, other
than either of the following  so long as they are not distributed for use
with, or incorporated in, a  Company Product constituting software that is
distributed, directly or  indirectly, to end users: (A) non-negotiated
licenses of generally  commercially available software that have been
licensed by the Company  on standard terms; and (B) Public Software licenses
set forth on  Section 2.18(g) of the Company Schedule. For the purposes of
this  Agreement, "IP LICENSES" means all the contracts, licenses and 
agreements to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party  with
respect to any Intellectual Property licensed to or by, or created  for or
by, the Company or any of its subsidiaries.   (i) All material IP Licenses
are in full force and effect.  Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is in breach of nor has  the Company or any of its subsidiaries
failed to perform under, and  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries
has received any notice  of any breach or failure to perform under, any IP
License and, to the  knowledge of the Company, no other party to any such IP
License is in  breach thereof or has failed to perform thereunder. Neither
the Company  nor any of its subsidiaries is currently in dispute with another
party  regarding the scope of any IP License, or    29     regarding
performance by any party under any IP License, including any  payments to be
made or received by the Company or any of its  subsidiaries thereunder. The
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (including
any subsequent merger of the  Surviving Corporation into the Parent) will
neither violate nor result  in the breach, modification, cancellation,
termination or suspension of  any IP Licenses or entitle the other party or
parties to such IP  Licenses to terminate such IP Licenses. Following the
Closing Date (and  any merger of the Surviving Corporation into the Parent),
both the  Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be permitted to exercise
all  of Company\'s or its subsidiaries\' rights under the IP Licenses to
the  same extent Company or the relevant subsidiary would have been able to 
had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred and  without
the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other  than ongoing
fees, royalties or payments which Company or such  subsidiary would otherwise
be required to pay. Neither the transactions  nor any merger of the Surviving
Company with the Parent, will result in  any third party being granted any
rights to any Company Intellectual  Property that are in addition to, or
greater than, such third party  currently has under such IP Licenses,
including any access to or  release of any source or object code owned by or
licensed to the  Company or any of its subsidiaries.   (j) The Company\'s
and its subsidiaries\' conduct of their  business as currently conducted does
not infringe, misappropriate or  otherwise violate any Intellectual Property
owned or claimed by another  person, violate any other intellectual property
right of another person  (including any right to privacy or publicity), or
constitute unfair  competition or trade practices under or, to the knowledge
of Company,  otherwise violate the Legal Requirements of, any jurisdiction,
and  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any
notice  thereof.   (k) No person has asserted or, to the knowledge of the 
Company, threatened to assert, any claims challenging the use,  ownership,
validity or enforceability of any Company Intellectual  Property or Company
Product. No material Company Intellectual Property  is subject to any
outstanding order, judgment, decree, stipulation or  agreement related to or
restricting in any manner the licensing,  assignment, transfer, use or
conveyance thereof by the Company or any  of its subsidiaries.   (l)
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has  brought any actions or
lawsuits alleging (A) infringement or  misappropriation of any of the Company
Intellectual Property or (B)  breach of any license, sublicense or other
agreement authorizing  another party to use any Company Intellectual
Property, and, to the  knowledge of the Company, there does not exist any
facts which could  form the basis of any such action or lawsuit. Neither the
Company nor  any of its subsidiaries has entered into any agreement granting
any  person the right to bring infringement or misappropriation actions
with  respect to, or otherwise to enforce rights with respect to, any of
the  Company Intellectual Property.   (m) The Company and its subsidiaries
have taken all reasonable  steps to protect the confidential information and
trade secrets (as  defined by each applicable jurisdiction) used in or
necessary for the  conduct of the business of the Company as currently
conducted and as  currently contemplated or provided by any other person to
the    30     Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to a written
non-disclosure  agreement and/or marked as "proprietary" or "confidential."

policy  requiring each current and former employee of the Company and its 
subsidiaries to execute proprietary information, confidentiality and

and (iii) except as provided in SCHEDULE  2.18(M)(III), all current and

creation or development of material Company Intellectual Property.   (n) No
government funding, facilities of a university,  college, other educational
institution or research center or funding  from third parties was used in the
development of any material Company  Intellectual Property. To the Company\'s
knowledge, no current or former  employee, consultant or independent
contractor of the Company or any of  its subsidiaries who was involved in, or
who contributed to, the  creation or development of any material Company
Intellectual Property,  has performed services for the government,
university, college, or  other educational institution or research center
during a period of  time during which such employee, consultant or
independent contractor  was also performing services for the Company or any
of its  subsidiaries.   (o) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement, including the assignment to Parent or
Surviving  Corporation, by operation of law or otherwise, of any IP
Licenses,  contracts or agreements to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries  is a party, will result in (i) either Parent\'s or the
Surviving  Corporation\'s granting to any third party any right to or with
respect  to any Intellectual Property owned by, or licensed to, either of
them,  (ii) either the Parent\'s or the Surviving Corporation\'s being bound
by,  or subject to, any non-compete or other restriction on the operation

prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act.
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide promptly to the Company such information
concerning itself as may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto. As promptly as
practicable after any comments are received from the SEC thereon (or upon
notice from the SEC that no such comments will be made), the Company shall,
in consultation with Parent, prepare and file any required amendments to, and
the definitive, Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company will cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as soon as practicable after
the definitive Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. The Company shall
give Parent and its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Proxy Statement, including all amendments and supplements thereto, prior
to its being filed with the SEC and shall give Parent and its counsel
reasonable opportunity to review all responses to requests for additional
information and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent

an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall
promptly inform Parent of such occurrence and, in consultation with Parent,
file with the SEC or its staff and/or mail to stockholders of the Company,
such amendment or supplement.   5.2 MEETING OF COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS.  
(a) Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall take all  action
reasonably necessary in accordance with Nevada Law and the  Company Charter
Documents to call, hold and convene an annual or  special meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of considering and  taking action on this
Agreement and the Merger (the "STOCKHOLDERS\'  MEETING"), to be held as
promptly as practicable, and, subject to the  Company\'s right to adjourn or
postpone the Stockholders\' Meeting  pursuant to this SECTION 5.2(A), in any
event within thirty (30)  calendar days after the Proxy Statement is mailed
to the stockholders  of the Company. Subject to the terms of SECTION 5.4(C)
hereof, the  Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
from  its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement
and  shall take all other action    44     necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of its  stockholders required by the rules of the
Nasdaq or Nevada Law to  obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary  contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or
postpone the  Stockholders\' Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that
any  necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided
to  the Company\'s stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger and this 
Agreement or, if as of the time for which the Stockholders\' Meeting is 
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are 
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in  person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the  business of the
Stockholders\' Meeting. The Company shall ensure that  the Stockholders\'
Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and  conducted, and that all
proxies solicited by the Company in connection  with the Stockholders\'
Meeting are solicited, in compliance with Nevada  Law, the Company Charter
Documents, the rules of the Nasdaq and all  other applicable legal
requirements. The Company\'s obligation to call,  give notice of, convene and
hold the Stockholders\' Meeting in  accordance with this SECTION 5.2(A) shall
not be limited to or  otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure,
announcement or  submission to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined in  SECTION 5.4(D) hereof). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company
shall  not be required to call, give notice of, convene or hold the 
Stockholders\' Meeting if this Agreement has been validly terminated 
(including, in the case of termination pursuant to SECTION 7.1(E), the 
payment of the Termination Fee) in accordance with Article VII hereof.  The
Company shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any  Acquisition
Proposal or publicly propose or resolve to do so, unless  this Agreement has
been validly terminated (including, in the case of  termination pursuant to
Section 7.1(E), the payment of the Termination  Fee) in accordance with
Article VII hereof.   (b) The Proxy Statement shall include the fairness
opinion  referred to in SECTION 2.22 hereof. Subject to the terms of
SECTION  5.4(C) hereof: (i) the Board shall unanimously recommend that the 
Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of this Agreement; (ii) the Proxy 
Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Board has 
unanimously recommended that the Company\'s stockholders vote in favor  of
this Agreement at the Stockholders\' Meeting; and (iii) neither the  Board
nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend, change or  modify, or
propose or resolve to withdraw, amend, change or modify, in  a manner adverse
to Parent, the recommendation of the Board that the  Company\'s stockholders
vote in favor this Agreement. For purposes of  this Agreement, said
recommendation of the Board shall be deemed to  have been modified in a
manner adverse to Parent, and a "Change of  Recommendation" shall be deemed
to have been made, if said  recommendation shall no longer be unanimous
(excluding, for the purpose  of determining whether said recommendation shall
no longer be  unanimous, directors who have abstained from such
recommendation due to  circumstances giving rise to an actual or potential
conflict of  interest; PROVIDED that this exclusion shall not be applicable
if the  remaining directors making such recommendation constitute less than
a  majority of the full Board), or if any director shall have publicly 
expressed opposition to this Agreement or the Transactions.    45    
5.3 CONFIDENTIALITY; ACCESS TO INFORMATION.   (a) The parties acknowledge
that Parent and the Company have  previously executed a Mutual Nondisclosure
and Nonuse Agreement, dated  as of May 17, 2006 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT"), which  Confidentiality Agreement will continue in full force and
effect in  accordance with its terms.   (b) The Company shall afford Parent
and its Representatives  reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice,  to the properties, books, records and personnel of the
Company during  the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all
information  concerning the business, including the status of product
development  efforts, properties, financial positions, results of operations
and  personnel of the Company, as Parent may reasonably request; PROVIDED 
that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business or 
operations of the Company or its subsidiaries; and PROVIDED, FURTHER  that to
the extent any such access would reasonably be expected to  result in a loss
or impairment of any attorney-client or work-product  privilege, the parties
shall use their respective reasonable best  efforts to cause such information
to be provided in a manner that does  not result in any such loss or
impairment (which reasonable best  efforts shall include entering into one or
more joint defense or  community of interest agreements on customary
terms).   (c) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any 
investigation pursuant to this SECTION 5.3 will affect or be deemed to 
modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the  conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the  Transactions.   5.4 NO
SOLICITATION.   (a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the approval
of  this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders or the termination of
this  Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries shall not, nor will they 
authorize or knowingly permit any of their respective officers,  directors,
affiliates or employees or any investment banker, attorney,  accountant, or
other advisor or representative retained by any of them  ("REPRESENTATIVES")
to, and they shall direct their respective  representatives not to, directly
or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate,  knowingly encourage, support,
facilitate or induce the making,  submission or announcement of, any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in  SECTION 5.4(D) hereof); (ii) participate
in any negotiations or  discussions regarding, or furnish to any person any
non-public  information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
proposal or  inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition  Proposal (it being understood and agreed that informing any
person as  to the existence of these provisions in response to any
unsolicited  Acquisition Proposal, proposal or inquiry, without providing
any  additional information, shall not constitute, or be deemed to be, a 
violation of the preceding clauses (i) or (ii) of this SECTION 5.4(A)); 
(iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or (iv)  enter
into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract  contemplating
or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction (as  defined in SECTION
5.4(D) hereof); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the terms of  this SECTION 5.4 shall
not prohibit the Company from furnishing non-    46     public
information regarding the Company and its subsidiaries to,  entering into a
confidentiality agreement with or entering into  negotiations or discussions
with, any person or group (and its or their  Representatives) in response to
an unsolicited written Acquisition  Proposal submitted by such person or
group (and not withdrawn) if: (1)  neither the Company nor its subsidiaries
shall have materially violated  any of the restrictions set forth in this
SECTION 5.4 in connection  with such Acquisition Proposal; (2) the Board
concludes in good faith,  after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that such action is  required in order for the Board to comply with its
fiduciary duties to  the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law; (3)(x)
at least two  (2) business days prior to furnishing any such information to,
or  entering into negotiations or discussions with, such person or group, 
the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of such person  or
group and of the Company\'s intention to furnish information to, or  enter
into negotiations or discussions with, such person or group, and  (y) the
Company receives from such person or group an executed  confidentiality
agreement containing terms and conditions which are not  less favorable to
the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement; and  (4) as soon as
practicable (and in any event no later than twenty four  (24) hours) after
furnishing any such information to such person or  group, the Company
furnishes such information to Parent. In addition to  the foregoing, the
Company shall provide Parent with at least  forty-eight (48) hours prior
written notice (or such lesser prior  notice as the longest notice provided
to any member of the Board) of a  meeting of the Board at which the Board is
reasonably expected to  consider any Acquisition Proposal and together with
such notice a copy  of any documentation relating to such Acquisition
Proposal (other than  confidential information provided by or on behalf of
the person or  group making such Acquisition Proposal relating to such
person\'s or  group\'s business or the effect of combining the business of
the Company  with such person\'s or group\'s business, in each case that such
person  or group specifically identifies as confidential ("THIRD PARTY 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"), PROVIDED that the parties hereby  acknowledge
that the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal  or any information
that is otherwise taken into account in determining  whether such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer shall  not under any circumstance be
deemed to be Third Party Confidential  Information). The Company and its
subsidiaries shall immediately cease  any and all existing activities,
negotiations or discussions with any  parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.  Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of  the restrictions set forth in this SECTION
5.4 by any officer or  director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or
by any other  Representative acting at the authorization or direction of the
Company  or any of its subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this 
SECTION 5.4 by the Company.   (b) From and after the execution of this
Agreement, in  addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
SECTION 5.4(A)  hereof, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
(within one  business day) and in writing (within two business days) of any
request  received by the Company for non-public information with respect to
an  Acquisition Proposal or the receipt by the Company of any Acquisition 
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or  Acquisition
Proposal, the identity of the person or group making any  such request or
Acquisition Proposal and a copy of all written  materials (other than Third
Party Confidential Information) provided by  or on behalf of such person or
group in connection with such request or  Acquisition    47    
Proposal. After receipt of any such request or Acquisition Proposal,  the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed in all material  respects of
the status and details (including material amendments or  proposed material
amendments) of any such request or Acquisition  Proposal and shall promptly
provide Parent a copy of all written  materials (other than Third Party
Confidential Information)  subsequently provided by or on behalf of such
person or group in  connection with such request or Acquisition Proposal.  
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the  contrary, nothing in
this Agreement shall prevent the Board from  withdrawing, amending, changing
or modifying its recommendation in  favor of the approval of this Agreement
or approving or recommending an  Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing
actions, whether by the  Board or a committee thereof, a "CHANGE OF
RECOMMENDATION") at any time  prior to the approval of this Agreement by the
Company\'s stockholders,  but the Board may do so only to terminate this
Agreement in accordance  with SECTION 7.1(E) hereof and only if all of the
following conditions  in clauses (i) through (v) are met: (i) an Acquisition
Proposal is made  to the Company and is not withdrawn and the Board
determines that such  Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer (as
defined in  SECTION 5.4(D) hereof), (ii) neither the Company nor any of its 
subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives shall have 
materially violated any of the restrictions set forth in SECTION 5.2 or 
SECTION 5.4 hereof, (iii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent  written
notice (a "CHANGE OF RECOMMENDATION NOTICE") at least three (3)  business
days prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation, which  shall (A) state
expressly that the Company has received a Superior  Offer and that the
Company intends to effect a Change of  Recommendation, (B) include a copy of
any definitive documentation  relating to such Superior Offer and such other
documentation reflecting  the final terms and conditions of such Superior
Offer as being  considered by the Board, and (C) disclose the identity of the
person or  group making such Superior Offer; (iv) after delivering the Change
of  Recommendation Notice, the Company shall provide Parent with a 
reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms and  conditions
of this Agreement during such three (3) business day period,  and negotiate
in good faith with Parent with respect thereto during  such three (3)
business day period; and (v) the Board concludes in good  faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that in light  of such Superior
Offer, and after considering any adjustments or  negotiations pursuant to the
preceding clause (iv), such Change of  Recommendation is required in order
for the Board to comply with its  fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
stockholders under applicable law.   (d) For purposes of this Agreement:

offer or proposal by Parent or Merger  Sub) relating to any Acquisition

or series of related transactions other than the  Transactions involving: (A)

offer that if consummated would result in any Third  Party beneficially
owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the  total outstanding voting
securities of the    48     Company or any of its subsidiaries or any
merger,  consolidation, business combination or similar transaction 
involving the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of  the Company
immediately preceding such transaction hold less  than eighty percent (80%)
of the equity interests in the  surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction; (B) any  sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition
or  disposition to any Third Party of more than twenty percent  (20%) of the
fair market value of the assets of the Company  and its subsidiaries, taken

any liquidation  or dissolution of the Company.   (iii) "SUPERIOR OFFER"
shall mean an unsolicited,  bona fide written Acquisition Proposal on terms
that the Board  determines in good faith in its reasonable judgment (after 
consultation with Wedbush Morgan Securities or another  financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be  more favorable to the Company
stockholders from a financial  point of view than the terms of the
Transactions (taking into  account any revisions or modifications made by
Parent and all  other relevant factors, including, without limitation, 
conditions relating to regulatory approvals, the existence of  a financing or
due diligence condition, timing considerations,  other events or
circumstances beyond the control of the party  invoking a condition and
whether financing for the Acquisition  Proposal is committed).   (iv)
"THIRD PARTY" means any person (including a  "group" as defined in Section
13(d)-3 of the Exchange Act)  other than the Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective  affiliates or subsidiaries.   (e) Nothing contained in

promulgated under the  Exchange Act; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that prior to taking
any of the  foregoing actions, the Company has complied with the applicable 
requirements of SECTION 5.4(C); and, PROVIDED, FURTHER, that any such 
disclosure (other than a "stop-look-and-listen" letter or similar 
communication under Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) 
relating to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a Change of 
Recommendation unless the Company Board rejects acceptance of such 
Acquisition Proposal and reaffirms its recommendation in favor of the 
approval of this Agreement in such disclosure.   5.5 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.  
(a) Parent and the Company shall consult with each other, and  to the extent
practicable, agree, before issuing any press release or  otherwise making any
public statement with respect to the Transactions,  this Agreement, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any  such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as may be  required by Legal Requirement or any
listing agreement with any  national securities    49     exchange or
national trading system, in which case reasonable efforts  to consult with
the other party will be made prior to such release or  public statement. The
parties have agreed to the text of the joint  press release announcing the

Corporation to, maintain in effect for not less than six (6) years after the
Effective Time policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance no
less favorable in all material respects to that maintained by or on behalf of
the Company and its subsidiaries on the date hereof (which policy is set
forth on SECTION 5.9(A) of the Company Schedule (the "CURRENT POLICY") (and
having coverage and containing terms and conditions which in the aggregate
are not less advantageous to the persons currently covered by such Current
Policy as insureds (the "INSURED PARTIES") with respect to claims arising
from any actual or alleged wrongful act or omission occurring prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, any acts or omissions relating
to the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions)
for which a claim has not been made against any director or officer of the
Company prior to the Effective Time or any director or officer of a Company
subsidiary prior to the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event
any claim is asserted or made within such six (6) year period, Parent shall
ensure that such insurance coverage will survive as to such claim until final
disposition of such claim; and PROVIDED FURTHER that if the aggregate annual
premiums for such insurance at any time during such period exceed 150% of the
per annum rate of premium currently paid by the Company and its subsidiaries
for the Current Policy on the date of this Agreement (which annual rate of
premium is set forth on SECTION 5.9(A) of the Company Schedule) (the "CURRENT
PREMIUM"), then Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation will, provide the maximum coverage that will then be
available at an annual premium equal to 150% of the Current Premium. Parent
may meet its obligations under this SECTION 5.9(A) by (i) covering the
Insured Parties under the Parent\'s insurance policy for its directors and
officers or, (ii) causing the Surviving Corporation to, or requesting that
the Company, purchase a six-year "tail" policy (and, upon Parent\'s request,

benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, the Insured Parties, and the
provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
as set forth herein and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation. Each of the Insured
Parties (and their respective heirs and representatives) shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained in this SECTION 5.9. The obligations of
Parent and the    52    Surviving Corporation under this SECTION 5.9
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Insured Party under this SECTION 5.9 without the consent of
such affected Insured Party. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this
SECTION 5.9.   5.10 REGULATORY FILINGS; REASONABLE EFFORTS. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the obligations of the parties set forth in SECTION

Justice (the "DOJ") pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions,
including the Merger and (ii) any appropriate pre-merger notifications under
the Antitrust Laws of any foreign jurisdiction, as reasonably agreed by the
parties to be appropriate. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause all
documents that it is responsible for filing with any Governmental Entity
under this SECTION 5.10 to comply in all material respects with applicable
law. The Company and Parent each shall promptly (a) supply the other with any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested

filings and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable, and (b) supply any additional information, which reasonably may
be required by the competition or merger control authorities of any other

promptly upon the receipt of (i) any comments from any officials of any
Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and
(ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments
or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to
comply in all materials respect with, applicable law. Whenever any event
occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant to this SECTION 5.10, each party will promptly inform
the other parties hereto of such occurrence and the Company will cooperate
with Parent in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment
or supplement. For purposes of this Agreement, "ANTITRUST LAW" means the

severance, separation or salary  continuation plans, programs or arrangements
and any and all plans  intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement
(unless Parent  provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans
shall not  be terminated)    53     (collectively, "COMPANY 401(K)
Plans"). Unless Parent provides such  written notice to the Company, no later
than five (5) business days  prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
provide Parent with  evidence that such Company 401(k) Plan(s) have been
terminated  (effective no later than the day immediately preceding the
Effective  Time) pursuant to resolutions of the Board. The form and substance
of  such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The 
Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of  terminating
such Company 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably  require.   (b) As

shall advise the Transferred Company  Employees (as defined below) of their
right to elect to receive a  distribution of, or to directly rollover, their
individual account  balances from the Company 401(k) Plan(s). To the extent
permitted by  Law, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, such
account  balances may be transferred by the Transferred Company Employees to
a  defined contribution retirement plan maintained by Parent (the 
"PARENT\'S 401(K) PLAN") in a direct rollover or rollover contribution, 
which, in the case of a Transferred Company Employee who rolls over his  or
her entire account balance, shall include any outstanding loan notes  from
the Company\'s 401(k) Plan(s). Prior to terminating the Company  401(k)
Plan(s), the Company shall take any steps necessary, including  amending the
Company 401(k) Plan(s) and any related 401(k) loan  policies, to ensure that
such rollover of participant accounts and  loans balances is permitted under
the terms of the Company 401(k)  Plan(s) and any 401(k) loan policies.

who remain employed after the Effective Time (each, a "TRANSFERRED COMPANY
EMPLOYEE" and collectively, the "TRANSFERRED COMPANY EMPLOYEES") with
substantially similar types and levels of employee benefits (other than
equity-based compensation or benefits) as those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent. Parent shall treat the service of Transferred
Company Employees with the Company or any subsidiary of the Company prior to
the Effective Time as service rendered to Parent or any affiliate of Parent
for purposes of eligibility and vesting in Parent\'s applicable benefit
plans, other than stock option and restricted stock unit vesting. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide that no Transferred Company
Employee, or any of his or her eligible dependents, who, at the Effective
Time, are participating in the Company group health plan shall be excluded
from the Parent\'s group plan, or limited in coverage thereunder, by reason
of any waiting period restriction or pre-existing condition limitation;
PROVIDED that such Transferred Company Employees are based in the United
States and meet applicable actively at work requirements as of the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to provide
any coverage, benefits, or credit inconsistent with the terms of
Parent benefit plans.   5.13 FIRPTA CERTIFICATE. On or prior to the

delivery of written notice from Parent to the Company of such Material 
Adverse Effect, provided the Company continues to exercise commercially 
reasonable efforts to cure such Material Adverse Effect (it being  understood
that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to  this paragraph (h)
if such Material Adverse Effect is cured during such  thirty (30) calendar
day period);   (i) by Parent, upon the occurrence of any of the events 
referred to in SECTION 6.3(J); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such event is 
curable by the Company prior to the End Date through the exercise of  its
commercially reasonable efforts, then Parent may not terminate this 
Agreement under this SECTION 7.1(I) for thirty (30) calendar days after 
delivery of written notice from Parent to the Company of the occurrence  of
such event, provided the Company continues to exercise commercially 
reasonable efforts to cure such event (it being understood that Parent  may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (i) if such  event is
cured during such thirty (30) calendar day period); or   (j) by Parent, if a

Change of Recommendation; (ii) the Company shall have failed to include in
the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board that holders of
Shares vote in favor of and approve this Agreement; (iii) the Board fails to

announcement by a Third Party of an Acquisition Proposal or an intent to make
an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) the Board or any committee thereof shall have
approved, endorsed or recommended any Acquisition Proposal; (v) the Company
shall have entered into any letter of intent or similar document or any

published sent or given, a statement disclosing that the Board recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer; or (v) the Company shall have
intentionally materially breached the provisions of SECTION 5.2 or
SECTION 5.4.    60     7.2 NOTICE OF TERMINATION; EFFECT OF
TERMination. Any termination of this Agreement under SECTION 7.1 hereof will
be effective immediately upon (or, if the termination is pursuant to SECTION
7.1(F), 7.1(G), 7.1(H) or 7.1(I) hereof and the proviso therein is
applicable, thirty (30) calendar days thereafter) the delivery of written
notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto. In the event of
the termination of this Agreement as provided in SECTION 7.1 hereof, this
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and there shall be no
liability to any party hereunder in connection with the Agreement or the
Transactions, except (i) as set forth in SECTION 5.3(A) hereof, this SECTION
7.2, SECTION 7.3 hereof and ARTICLE VIII hereof, each of which shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
party from liability for fraud or any intentional or willful breach of, or
any intentional misrepresentation made in, this Agreement. No termination of
this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.   7.3 FEES
AND EXPENSES.   (a) GENERAL. Except as set forth in this SECTION 7.3, all
fees  and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the 
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether  or
not the Merger is consummated; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent and  Company
shall share equally any filing fee for any Notification and  Report Form
filed with the FTC and the DOJ pursuant to the HSR Act, and  any appropriate
pre-merger notifications under the Antitrust Laws of  any foreign
jurisdiction, as reasonably agreed by the parties to be  appropriate, in each
case pursuant to SECTION 5.10 hereof.   (b) COMPANY PAYMENTS.   (i) The
Company shall pay to Parent in immediately  available funds, within three (3)
business days after written  demand by Parent, an amount equal to Four
Million Two Hundred  and Seventy One Thousand Dollars ($4,271,000) (the 
"TERMINATION FEE") if this Agreement is terminated by Parent  pursuant to
SECTION 7.1(J) hereof.   (ii) The Company shall pay to Parent in
immediately  available funds, concurrent with a termination by Company of 
this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 7.1(E) hereof, an amount  equal to the
Termination Fee, and no such termination of this  Agreement shall be deemed
effected until such time as the  Termination Fee shall have been paid to
Parent.   (iii) The Company shall pay Parent in immediately  available
funds, within one (1) business day after written  demand by Parent, an amount
equal to the Termination Fee, if  this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to SECTION  7.1(B) or SECTION 7.1(D) hereof and any of the following
shall  occur:    61     (A) if following the date hereof and prior 
to the termination of this Agreement, a Third Party  has announced, and not
publicly definitively  withdrawn at least five (5) business days prior to 
such termination, an Acquisition Proposal and within  twelve (12) months
following the termination of this  Agreement any Company Acquisition (as
defined below)  is consummated; or   (B) if following the date hereof and
prior  to the termination of this Agreement, a Third Party  has announced,
and not publicly definitively  withdrawn at least five (5) business days
prior to  such termination, an Acquisition Proposal and within  twelve (12)
months following the termination of this  Agreement the Company enters into a
letter of intent  or similar document or any written Contract providing  for
any Company Acquisition or publicly announces its  intent to enter into a
Company Acquisition, and such  Company Acquisition is subsequently
consummated  within nine (9) months thereafter.   (iv) The Company shall
pay to Parent in immediately  available funds, within two (2) business days
after written  demand by Parent, if this Agreement is terminated by Parent 
pursuant to SECTION 7.1(G) based on a failure to satisfy the  condition set
forth in SECTION 6.3(B) and, (x) prior to such  termination, the Company has
received, or a Third Party has  announced, an Acquisition Proposal and (y)
such breach is  intended to facilitate such Acquisition Proposal or benefit 
the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal without  similarly
benefiting Parent, an amount equal to the  out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred by Parent and Merger  Sub in connection with the negotiation,
execution and delivery  of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby  (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney fees and 
expenses, reasonable advisor fees and expenses, travel costs,  filing fees,
printing, mailing and solicitation costs and  expenses).   (v) The Company
hereby acknowledges and agrees that  the agreements set forth in this SECTION
7.3(B) with respect  to payment of the Termination Fee are an integral part
of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without 
these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.  Accordingly,
if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner  the amounts due pursuant to
this SECTION 7.3(B) and, in order  to obtain such payment, Parent makes a
claim that results in a  judgment against the Company for the amounts set
forth in this  SECTION 7.3(B), the Company shall pay to Parent its
reasonable  costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and 
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest  on the
amounts set forth in this SECTION 7.3(B) at the prime  rate of Citibank N.A.
in effect on the date such payment was  required to be made. Payment of the
Termination Fee by the  Company shall constitute liquidated damages, and
Parent\'s  right to receive a Termination Fee in the circumstances  provided
in this SECTION 7.3(B) is the exclusive remedy  available to the Parent for
any failure of the Merger and  other Transactions to be consummated in those
circumstances,  and the Company shall    62     have no further
liability with respect to this Agreement or  the Transactions, except as
described in the previous  sentence; PROVIDED that in no event shall a
Termination Fee be  in lieu of damages incurred as a result of any
intentional or  willful breach of, or any intentional misrepresentation
made  in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the payment  by the
Company of any Parent Expenses pursuant to SECTION  7.2(B)(IV) shall not
constitute liquidated damages with  respect to any claim which Parent or
Merger Sub would be  entitled to assert against the Company or its assets,
or  against any of the Company\'s directors, officers, employees or 
stockholders, with respect to any such breach, and shall not  constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any  such breach.   (vi) For the
purposes of this Agreement, "COMPANY  ACQUISITION" shall mean any of the
following transactions  (other than the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement):  (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination, 
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar  transaction involving
the Company pursuant to which the  stockholders of the Company immediately
preceding such  transaction hold less than a majority of the aggregate
equity  interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such  transaction,
(ii) a sale or other disposition by the Company  of all or more than a
majority of the assets of the Company  and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (iii) the  acquisition by any person or group (including by way of
a  tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the Company),  directly
or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to  acquire beneficial
ownership of shares representing in excess  of a majority of the voting power
of the then outstanding  shares of capital stock of the Company.   7.4
AMENDMENT. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of Parent and the Company.   7.5 EXTENSION;
WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may, to the
extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
party contained herein; PROVIDED that SECTION 6.1(A) may not be
waived without the express written consent of Parent. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay
in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.   ARTICLE VIII  GENERAL PROVISIONS   8.1 NON-SURVIVAL OF
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and warranties of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall   
63    terminate at the Effective Time, and only the covenants that by
their terms survive the Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time.

such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties
further    66    agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision
of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve,
to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
void or unenforceable provision.   8.7 OTHER REMEDIES; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.
Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
