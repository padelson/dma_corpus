ARTICLE  I

 

 

THE  MERGER

 

 

Section  1.1 _The  Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this  Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), the
separate  existence of the Merger Sub shall cease and the Merger Sub shall be
merged  with  and into the Company in accordance with the laws of the State
of  Washington. The Company shall be the Surviving Corporation (as  defined
below) in the Merger, shall continue its corporate existence under  the 
laws of the State of Washington and, following the Effective Time, the
Company  shall become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Parent and
shall succeed  to and assume all of the rights and obligations of the Merger
Sub in accordance  with the Washington Business Corporation Act, as amended
(the  "BCA"). The effects and consequences of the Merger shall be as set 
forth in Section 1.2. The surviving corporation after the Merger is 
sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation."

 

 

Section  1.2 _Effects  of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, (a) the
articles of  incorporation of the Company in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time  shall at the Effective Time be amended in their entirety to
be the same as  the  articles of incorporation of the Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior  to  the Effective Time, except that the name of
the corporation shall be "Puget  Energy, Inc.," and as so amended in their
entirety shall be set forth on  Attachment A to the Articles of Merger (as
defined below) and shall be the  articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter duly  amended, (b) the by-laws of the Company
shall, as of the Effective Time, be  amended in their entirety to be the same
as the by-laws of the Merger Sub in  effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except as to the name of the  Surviving Corporation, which
shall be "Puget Energy, Inc.," and as so amended  in  their entirety shall
by the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until  thereafter duly amended,
and (c) the Merger shall have all of the effects  provided by the BCA. As of
the Effective Time, each of the directors  of the Company shall resign and
the directors of the Merger Sub at the Effective  Time shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving  Corporation until
their successors have been duly elected or appointed and  qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance  with the articles
of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving  Corporation. The officers
of the Company at the Effective Time shall,  from and after the Effective
Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation  until their successors
have been duly elected or appointed and  qualified.

 

 

Section  1.3 _Effective  Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement,  on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 3.1), articles of
merger in  substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Articles
of Merger")  shall be executed and filed by the Company and the Merger Sub
with the Secretary  of State of the State of Washington pursuant to the BCA.
The Merger  shall become effective upon the filing of the Articles of Merger
with the  Secretary of State of the State of Washington or upon the effective
date  specified in Articles of Merger so filed, whichever is later (the
"Effective  Time").

 

 

ARTICLE  II

 

 

TREATMENT  OF SHARES

 

 

Section  2.1 _Effect  on Capital Stock of the Company and the Merger Sub_.
As of the  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part  of  any holder of any of the capital stock of the Company or the
Merger  Sub:

 

 

(a) _Conversion  of Capital Stock of the Company_. Each share of common
stock, par  value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common
Stock") issued and  outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than shares
of Company Dissenting  Common Stock (as defined in Section 2.2) and other
than shares of Company Common  Stock to be treated in accordance with Section
2.1(b)), shall be cancelled  and  shall be converted into the right to
receive cash in the amount of $30.00 per  share (the "Merger Consideration"),
payable, without interest, to the holder  of  such share of Company Common
Stock, upon surrender, in accordance with Section  2.3 hereof, of the
certificate formerly evidencing such share.

 

 

(b) _Treatment  of Certain Shares of Company Common Stock_. Each share of
Company  Common Stock that is owned by the Parent or by any wholly owned
Subsidiary  (as  defined in Section 4.1) of the Company or the Parent, in
each case immediately  prior to the Effective Time, shall remain outstanding
and shall become that  number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation that bears the  same ratio to the aggregate number of outstanding
shares of the Surviving  Corporation as the number of shares of Company
Common Stock held by such entity  bore to the aggregate number of outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock  immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) _Capital  Stock of the Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par
value  $0.01 per share, of the Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior  to  the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding after the
Merger as  a  share of the Surviving Corporation, which shall thereafter
(together with the  shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
issued in accordance with  Section 2.1(b)) constitute all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common  stock of the Surviving Corporation. No capital
stock of the Merger  Sub will be issued or used in the Merger.

 

 

Section  2.2 _Company  Dissenting Common Stock_.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary other than
Section 2.2(b), any shares  of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to  the  Effective Time and held by a
shareholder who is entitled to dissent from the  Merger under Chapter 23B.13
of the BCA and who has exercised, when and in  the manner required by Chapter
23B.13 of the BCA to the extent so required  prior to the Effective Time,
such right to dissent and to obtain payment of  the  fair value of such
shares under Chapter 23B.13 of the BCA in connection  with the Merger
("Company Dissenting Common Stock") shall not be converted  into  the right
to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such shareholder  shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost (through failure to perfect or  otherwise)
such shareholder\'s right to obtain payment of the fair value of  such 
shareholder\'s Company Dissenting Common Stock under Chapter 23B.13 of the 
BCA, but shall instead be entitled only to such rights with respect to such 
Company Dissenting Common Stock as may be granted to such shareholder under 
Chapter 23B.13 of the BCA. From and after the Effective Time,  Company
Dissenting Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote for any purpose  or 
be entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions (except
dividends  or other distributions payable to shareholders of record prior to
the Effective  Time). The Company shall give the Parent and the Merger Sub
(i)  prompt written notice of the exercise of the right of dissent of any
shares  of  Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such exercise and
any other  instruments served pursuant to the BCA and received by the Company
relating  to  rights to be paid the fair value of Company Dissenting Common
Stock under  Chapter 23B.13 of the BCA and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in  negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of
the right of  dissent under Chapter 23B.13 of the BCA. The Company shall
not,  except with the prior written consent of the Parent, voluntarily make
or agree  to make any material payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle  any  claims relating to, the exercise of the right of dissent
under  Chapter 23B.13 of the BCA.

 

 

(b) If  any  shareholder who holds Company Dissenting Common Stock
effectively withdraws  or  loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
such shareholder\'s right to  obtain payment of the fair value of such
shareholder\'s Company Dissenting Common  Stock under Chapter 23B.13 of the
BCA, then, as of the later of the  Effective Time and the occurrence of such
effective withdrawal or loss, such  shareholder\'s shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be Company  Dissenting Common Stock and, if the
occurrence of such effective withdrawal  or  loss is later than the
Effective Time, shall be treated as if they had as of  the  Effective Time
been converted into the right to receive the Merger  Consideration, without
interest, as set forth in subsection (a) of Section  2.1.

 

 

Section  2.3 _Surrender  of Shares_.

 

 

(a) _Deposit  with Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
and  the Parent shall mutually designate a bank or trust company to act as
agent  (the  "Paying Agent") for the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock in connection  with the Merger to receive the funds to which holders of
shares of Company  Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(a). Such  funds shall be deposited with the Paying Agent by the Parent
immediately prior  to or after the Effective Time and shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as  directed by the Parent; provided that, no investment of
such deposited funds  shall relieve the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent from  promptly making the payments required by this Article
II, and  following any losses from any such investment, the Parent shall
promptly provide  additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the
holders of shares  of  Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the
amount of such losses, which  additional funds will be held and disbursed in
the same manner as funds  initially deposited with the Paying Agent for
payment of the Merger  Consideration to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock.

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the  Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or 
certificates (the "Certificates") which as of the Effective Time represented 
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Cancelled Shares") that
were  cancelled or converted and became instead the right to receive the
Merger  Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall  specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the  Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the
Certificates (or  affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and
such other  provisions upon which the Parent and the Company may agree) and
(ii)  instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or  affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger 
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of  loss in
lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent for cancellation (or to such other  agent
or agents as may be appointed by mutual agreement of the Parent and the 
Company), together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other 
documents as the Paying Agent may require, the holder of such Certificate
shall  be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (after giving effect
to any  required tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.5) in exchange for
each  share  of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate,
which such  holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article  II. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Cancelled Shares
which  is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger 
Consideration may be given to a transferee if the Certificate (or affidavit 
of  loss in lieu thereof) representing such Cancelled Shares is presented to
the  Paying Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such  transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent that
any applicable  Transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by  this Section 2.3, each Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) shall  be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right  to  receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this  Section 2.3. No interest shall be paid
or will accrue on the Merger  Consideration payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions  of  this Article II.

 

 

(c) _Closing  of Transfer Books; Rights of Holders of Company Common 
Stock_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer  books of the
Company shall be closed and no registration of any transfer of  any  capital
stock of the Company shall thereafter be made on the records of the  Company.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to  the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger 
Consideration, as provided in this Section 2.3. From and after the  Effective
Time, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding  immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with  respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided  herein or
by applicable law.

 

 

(d) _Termination  of Paying Agent_. At any time commencing one year after
the  Effective Time, the Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to  deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent
and  not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including,
without  limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying
Agent in  respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter such
holders shall  be  entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property,  escheat and other similar laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect  to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the  Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the  Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any  holder of a share of Company Common Stock for
any Merger Consideration delivered  in respect of such share to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned  property, escheat or other similar law.

 

 

(e) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate 
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit 
of  that fact by the holder of shares of Company Common Stock claiming such 
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Parent, 
the  posting by such holder of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as  may  be required by the Parent as indemnity against any claim that may
be made  against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the  Paying Agent will pay the Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any  required tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.5)
to such holder in exchange  for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

 

 

Section  2.4 _Treatment  of Company Stock Awards_.

 

 

(a) _Options_. Prior  to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to provide,  effective as of the Effective Time, for the
cancellation, on the terms and  conditions set forth in this Section 2.4 and
without any payment therefor except  as otherwise provided in this Section
2.4, of all stock options (whether or  not  then exercisable) on Company
Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time  granted under any plan,
program, agreement or arrangement maintained by the  Company to provide for
grants of equity-based awards (the  "Options"). As of the Effective Time,
each such Option (whether  vested or unvested) shall be cancelled (and to the
extent formerly so  exercisable shall no longer be exercisable) and shall
entitle each holder  thereof, in cancellation and settlement therefor, to
receive a payment, if  any,  in cash from the Company (less any applicable
withholding taxes), promptly  following the Effective Time, equal to (i) the
amount, if any, by which the  higher of (x) the Merger Consideration and (y)
the average of the last sale  prices of the Company Common Stock on the New
York Stock Exchange in each of  the  twenty (20) business days preceding the
Effective Time exceeds the exercise  price per share with respect to such
Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number  of shares of Company Common
Stock then issuable upon the exercise of such Option  (whether or not then
vested or exercisable).

 

 

(b) _Employee  Stock Purchase Plan_. The current offerings in progress as of
the  date hereof under the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"ESPP") shall  continue, and the shares of Company Common Stock shall be
issued to participants  thereunder on the next currently scheduled purchase
dates thereunder occurring  after the date hereof as provided under, and
subject to the terms and conditions  of, the ESPP. In accordance with the
terms of the ESPP, any offering  in progress as of the Effective Time shall
be shortened, and the "Purchase  Date"  (as defined in the ESPP) shall be
the business day immediately preceding the  Effective Time. Each then
outstanding Option under the ESPP shall be  exercised automatically on such
Purchase Date. Notwithstanding any  restrictions on transfer of stock in the
ESPP, the treatment in the Merger  of  any stock under this provision shall
be in accordance with Section  2.1(a). The Company shall take commercially
reasonable steps to  terminate the ESPP as of or prior to the Effective Time.
The Company  shall promptly after the date hereof take commercially
reasonable steps to  amend  the ESPP as appropriate to avoid the
commencement of any new offering of Options  thereunder at or after the date
hereof and prior to the earlier of the  termination of this Agreement or the
Effective Time.

 

 

(c) _Other  Awards_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all  actions necessary to provide, effective as of the Effective Time, for
the  cancellation, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 2.4
and  without any payment therefore except as otherwise provided in this
Section  2.4,  of each award (the "Company Awards") (including each share of
restricted stock,  and each restricted stock unit, stock equivalent and
performance share, but  excluding Options) outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time that was  granted under any plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained by the  Company to provide for grants of equity-based
awards. As of the  Effective Time, each such Company Award shall be cancelled
and shall entitle  each holder thereof, in cancellation and settlement
therefor, to receive a  payment in cash from the Company (less any applicable
withholding taxes),  promptly following the Effective Time, equal to (i) the
higher of (x) the Merger  Consideration and (y) the average of the last sale
prices of the Company Common  Stock on the New York Stock Exchange in each of
the twenty (20) business days  preceding the Effective Time, multiplied by
(ii) the total number of shares  of  Company Common Stock that would be
issuable upon full vesting of such award  or  for which restrictions would
lapse upon full vesting of such award; provided  that, in the case of
performance shares, the cash amount shall be equal to  (1)  the higher of
(A) the Merger Consideration and (B) the average of the last  sale  prices
of the Company Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange in each of  the 
twenty (20) business days preceding the Effective Time, multiplied by (2)
the  higher of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that
would  be  issuable upon vesting of such award or for which restrictions
would lapse upon  vesting of such award at the target performance level and
(B) the number of  shares that would be issuable upon vesting of such award
or for which  restrictions would lapse upon vesting of such award if the
Company achieved,  for  each outstanding award cycle, the performance
measure that the Company had  achieved for the applicable cycle during the
period commencing upon the starting  year of such cycle and ending with the
fiscal quarter immediately preceding  the  Effective Time, plus (3) the
amount of dividend equivalents associated with  the  number of shares
determined under this Section 2.4(c).

 

 

(d) _Required  Action_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Board  of Directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the
Board of  Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take  any actions, including obtaining consents and
acknowledgements of participants,  which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of Section 2.4(a), (b) and  (c). The Company shall take all
commercially reasonable actions to  ensure that from and after the Effective
Time neither the Parent nor the  Surviving Corporation will be required to
deliver Company Common Stock or other  capital stock of the Company to any
Person pursuant to or in settlement of  Options, rights under the ESPP or
Company Awards. The Company shall  also take all action reasonably necessary
to approve the disposition of the  Options or Company Awards in accordance
with this Section 2.4 so as to exempt  such dispositions under Rule 16b-3 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as  amended (the "Exchange Act").

 

 

Section  2.5 _Withholding  Rights_. Other than in respect of Transfer Taxes,
which shall be  governed by Section 7.16, each of the Surviving Corporation,
the Company, the  Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the  Merger Consideration or other payments made pursuant to
this Agreement to any  holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Options or
Company Awards or other  Person (as defined below) such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold  with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code  of  1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the
rules and regulations promulgated  thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax (as defined in  Section 4.9) law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the  Surviving Corporation, the Company, the
Parent or the Paying Agent, as the  case  may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this  Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Common  Stock, Options or Company Awards
or other Person in respect of which such  deduction and withholding was made
by the Surviving Corporation, the Company,  the Parent or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be. As used in this  Agreement, the term "Person" shall mean
any natural person, corporation, general  or limited partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, trust,  association or entity of any kind.

 

 

Section  2.6 _Adjustments  to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the
Company changes the  number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities
convertible or  exchangeable into or exercisable for Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding  prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split  (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution,  recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar  transaction (other than the issuance of
securities contemplated by the Stock  Purchase Agreement and, in the event
the Stock Purchase Agreement is terminated,  any securities issued by the
Company as contemplated by Section 6.1 of the  Company Disclosure Letter),
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably  adjusted.

 

 

ARTICLE  III

 

 

THE  CLOSING

 

 

Section  3.1 _Closing_. The  closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place at the offices of Dewey  and LeBoeuf LLP, 1301 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York 10019 at  10:00 a.m., local time, on the
fifteenth business day immediately following  the  date on which the last of
the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof is  fulfilled or waived
(other than any conditions that by their nature are to  be  satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those  conditions at
the Closing), or at such other time, date and place as the Company  and the
Parent shall mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). The Parent  agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to accelerate the Closing and  if 
practicable will agree to hold the Closing prior to such fifteenth business 
day.

 

 

ARTICLE  IV

The  Company represents and warrants to the Parent and the Merger Sub that
except  as  set forth in (a) the letter, dated as of the date hereof,

delivery of this  Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), with specific
reference  to the particular Section or Subsection of this Agreement to which
the  information set forth in such letter relates (it being agreed that
disclosure  of  any item in any Section or Subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall  be  deemed disclosure with respect to any other
Section or Subsection to which  the  relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent), or (b) the Company SEC Reports  filed by the Company with, or
furnished by the Company to, the U.S. Securities  and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") at any time on or after December 31, 2005  through the date
hereof and publicly available on the website of the SEC through  the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System prior to the date 
hereof, other than information in the "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking 
Statements" sections of such Company SEC Reports, and any other similar 
disclosures included in such Company SEC Reports that are predictive,
cautionary  or forward-looking in nature; provided, however, that nothing in
the Company  SEC  Reports shall be deemed to qualify, or be deemed to have
been disclosed for  the  purposes of, Section 4.3:

 

 

Section  4.1 _Organization  and Qualification_. The Company and each of the
Company  Subsidiaries (as defined below) is a corporation, limited liability
company  or  limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing,  as  applicable, under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or  organization. The Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries has  all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its assets and  properties to the extent owned, leased and operated and to
carry on its business  as it is now being conducted and is duly qualified and
in good standing to  do  business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or the  ownership or leasing of its assets and properties
makes such qualification  necessary other than in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified  or in good standing would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably  be  expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined  below). As used in this Agreement, (a)
the term "Subsidiary" of a  Person shall mean any other Person of which at
least a majority of the voting  power represented by the outstanding capital
stock or other voting securities  or  interests having voting power under
ordinary circumstances to elect directors  or  similar members of the
governing body of such corporation or entity or fifty  percent (50%) or more
of the equity interests in such corporation or entity  shall at the time be
owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by such Person  and/or by one or
more of its Subsidiaries; (b) the term "Company Subsidiary"  shall mean a
Subsidiary of the Company and (c) the term "Company Material  Adverse Effect"
shall mean any event, change or occurrence or development of  a  set of
circumstances or facts, which, individually or together with any other 
event, change, occurrence or development, has or would have a material
adverse  effect on the business, assets, liabilities, properties, financial
condition  or  results of operations of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as  a  whole; provided, however, that the term "Company
Material Adverse Effect" shall  not include (i) any such effect resulting
from any change, including any change  in law, rule, or regulation of any
Governmental Authority (as defined in Section  4.4(c)), that applies
generally to similarly situated Persons, (ii) any such  effect relating to or
resulting from general changes in the electric or natural  gas utility
industry, other than such effects having a disproportionate impact  on the
Company as compared to similarly situated Persons, (iii) any such effect 
relating to or resulting from the 2007 WUTC Rate Case (as defined in Section 
6.1) before the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission ("WUTC"), 
(iv) any such effect relating to or resulting from changes to accounting 
standards, principles or interpretations, (v) any such effect resulting from 
the  announcement of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of
the  transactions contemplated hereby (except to the extent that the Company
has  made  an express representation with respect to the effect of such
consummation on  the  Company and the Company Subsidiaries), including any
such change resulting  therefrom in the market value of the Company Common

Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses, franchises  and  other governmental

that, individually or in the aggregate,  materially adversely impair the
current use of the Real Property by the Company  or Puget Sound Energy);

 

 

(iii) zoning,  planning, building and other applicable laws regulating the
use, development  and  occupancy of real property and permits, consents and
rules under such  laws;

 

 

(iv) Liens  that have been placed by a third party on the fee title of Leased
Real Property  or Easement Real Property that are subordinate to the rights
therein of the  Company or Puget Sound Energy or that, if foreclosed, would
not materially  adversely impair the conduct of the business of the Company
or Puget Sound  Energy as presently conducted;

improvement of the land,  which arises from the rights of the public or
riparian owners to use any waters  which may cover the land or to use any
portion of the land which is now or  may  formerly have been covered by
water (other than the matters described in this  subsection (ix) that,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely  impair the current

(x) questions  as to whether Puget Sound Energy\'s title or right to use (a)
railroad rights  of  way, or (b) utility corridors that purports to be Owned
Real Property is  actually Easement Real Property because such title or right
traces from rights  denominated by deed as a "right-of-way" or similar term;

 

 

(xi) Liens  that, to the knowledge of the Company, could be remedied by
exercise of the  authority to acquire property or rights therein by eminent
domain for an amount  of compensation that would not result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect;  and

reasonably  be  expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

$5,000,000 (or $1,000,000 if the Owned  Real  Property is otherwise used or
useful in the utility operations of Puget Sound  Energy), or that, if such
sale, assignment or disposition is consummated, could  individually or in the
aggregate materially adversely impair the conduct of  the  business of the
Company or Puget Sound Energy as presently  conducted.

Puget Sound Energy  is  a lessee or sublessee (each, a "Real Property
Lease") and each easement or  subeasement for real property under which the
Company or Puget Sound Energy  owns  an easement interest (each, an
"Easement") is, to the knowledge of the Company,  in full force and effect
and is the valid and binding obligation of the Company  or Puget Sound
Energy, enforceable against the Company or Puget Sound Energy  in 
accordance with its terms and, to the knowledge of the Company, the other
party  or parties thereto, subject to Permitted Real Property Liens, subject
to the  effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,

sublandlord, land owner or the  owner of an easement who has granted a

contemplated  by  this Agreement and (c) there are no judgments, decrees,
injunctions, rules  or  orders of any court, governmental department,

December 31, 2006 or would not reasonably  be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except  for matters reflected as liabilities or
reserved against in the balance sheet  (or notes thereto) as of December 31,
2006, included in the Company Financial  Statements, as of the date of this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any  Company Subsidiary has any

Effect. Except as may be set forth in any Company Required Statutory 
Approval or Parent Required Statutory Approval, there are no restrictions 
(contractual or regulatory) limiting the ability of Puget Sound Energy from 
making distributions, dividends or other return of capital to the  Company.

interest in the portion of its assets defined as Collateral  in the Loan and

Section  4.10 _Employee  Benefits; ERISA_.

 

 

(a) _Company  Plans_. Section 4.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
contains  a true and complete list of each deferred compensation and each
bonus or other  incentive compensation, stock purchase, stock option and
other equity  compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement;
each severance  or  termination pay, medical, surgical, hospitalization,
life insurance and other  "welfare plan," fund or program (within the meaning
of Section 3(1) of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA")); each  profit-sharing, stock bonus or other "pension
plan," fund or program (within  the  meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA); each
employment, termination or severance  contract, arrangement, policy or
agreement; and each other employee benefit  plan, fund, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement; in each case, that (i)  is  sponsored, maintained
or contributed to or required to be contributed to by  the  Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any trade or business, whether or not  incorporated,
that together with the Company or any Company Subsidiary is deemed  a "single
employer" under Section 4001(b) of ERISA (an "ERISA Affiliate"),  or to 
which the Company or an ERISA Affiliate is a party, for the benefit of any 
employee or former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or with 
respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary to its knowledge has 
any  liability, and (ii) is material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries  taken as a whole (the "Company Plans").

 

 

(b) _Deliveries_. With  respect to each Company Plan, the Company has
heretofore delivered or made  available to the Parent true and complete
copies of (i) each of the Company  Plans as currently in effect; (ii) if the
Company Plan is funded through a  trust  or any third party funding vehicle,
a copy of the trust or other funding  agreement; (iii) the most recent
determination or opinion letter received from  the Internal Revenue Service
with respect to each Company Plan intended to  qualify under Section 401 of
the Code; (iv) if applicable, the most recent  annual report (Form 5500
series) filed with the Internal Revenue Service; (v)  if  applicable, the
most recent actuarial report prepared for such Company Plan;  and  (vi) for
the last three years, all material correspondence with the  Internal Revenue
Service, the United States Department of Labor, the Pension  Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC"), the SEC and any other Governmental  Authority
regarding the operation or the administration of any Company  Plan.

 

 

(c) _Absence  of Liability_. No material liability under Title IV of ERISA
has  been incurred by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate  that  has not been satisfied in full and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no  condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company,
any Company  Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such
liability, other than  liability for premiums due to the PBGC (which premiums
have been paid when  due). No notice of a "reportable event," within the
meaning of  Section 4043 of ERISA for which the reporting requirement has not
been waived  or  extended, other than pursuant to PBGC Reg. Section 4043.33
or 4043.66, has  been  required to be filed for any Company Plan within the
12-month period ending  on  the date hereof or will be required to be filed
in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
notices have been  required to be sent to participants and beneficiaries or
the PBGC under Section  302 or 4011 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code with
respect to the most recent  three fiscal years of the applicable Company Plan
ended prior to the Closing  Date.

 

 

(d) _Present  Value of Accrued Benefits_. With respect to each Company Plan 
subject to Title IV of ERISA (a "Title IV Company Plan"), the present value 
of  accrued benefits under such plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions
used  for  funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by
such plan\'s  actuary with respect to such plan, did not exceed, as of the
end of the most  recent fiscal year of such plan ended prior to the Closing
Date, the then  current value of the assets of such plan allocable to such
accrued benefits  by  an amount that is material to the Company and the
Company subsidiaries taken  as  a whole.

 

 

(e) _Funding_. No  Title IV Company Plan has incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as  defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of
the Code), whether or not  waived, as of the last day of the most recent
fiscal year of such Title IV  Company Plan ended prior to the Closing Date.
Except as would not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect, all material
contributions required to be made with  respect to any Company Plan on or
before the date hereof have been made and  all  obligations in respect of
each Company Plan as of the date hereof have been  accrued and reflected in
the Company Financial Statements to the extent required  by GAAP.

 

 

(f) _Multiemployer  Plans_. No Title IV Company Plan is a "multiemployer
plan," as  defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, nor is any Title IV
Company Plan a  plan  described in Section 4063(a) of ERISA.

 

 

(g) _No  Violations_. Each Company Plan has been operated and administered 
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable law, 
including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. As of the date  hereof,
there is no material pending or, to the knowledge of the Company  threatened,
litigation relating to the Company Plans. Neither the  Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction with respect  to  any
Company Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired 
as of the date hereof, would subject the Company or any Company Subsidiary 
to a  tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502(i)  of  ERISA in an amount which would be material to the Company and
the Company  Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any
Company  Subsidiary has incurred or reasonably expects to incur a tax or
penalty imposed  by Section 4980 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA or any
liability under  Section 4071 of ERISA, in any such case, in an amount which
would be material  to  the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. To the  knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has  any  material liability with respect to any
misclassification of any Person as an  independent contractor rather than as
an employee. Since January 1,  2005, each Company Plan that is subject to
Section 409A of the Code has been  administered in all material respects in
good faith compliance with Section  409A  of the Code.

 

 

(h) _Section  401(a) Qualification_. Each Company Plan intended to be 
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a 
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service covering all tax law 
changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001  or has remaining a period of time under the Code or applicable
Treasury  Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to
request,  and  make any amendments necessary to obtain, such a letter from
the Internal Revenue  Service; and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances likely to result  in  the loss of the qualification of such
Company Plan under Section 401(a) of  the  Code.

 

 

(i) _Post-Employment  Benefits_. No Company Plan provides medical, surgical,
vision,  hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured)
for  employees or former employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
for  periods extending beyond their respective dates of retirement or other 
termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, 
(ii)  death benefits under any "pension plan," (iii) benefits the full cost
of which  is borne by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary),
(iv) retiree  medical subsidies as set forth in the IBEW Collective
Bargaining Agreement,  or  (v) other retiree medical subsidies as described
in Section 4.10(i) of the  Company Disclosure Letter.

 

 

(j) _Effect  of Change of Control_. Other than payments that may be made to
the  Persons listed in Section 4.10(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Company  Executives"), neither the execution of this Agreement, shareholder
approval  of  this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby  will  (w) result in payments (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property)  to any employee, officer or director of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary  who is a "disqualified individual" (as
such term is defined in Treasury  Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination  agreement, other compensation
arrangement or any of the Company Plans that  would  not be deductible under
Section 162(m) or that would be characterized as an  "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code),  (x)  entitle any
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to severance  pay  or any
increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment after the  date
hereof, or (y) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or result in  any 
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or 
benefits under, increase the amount payable or result in any other material 
obligation pursuant to, any of the Company Plans. There has been no 
amendment to, announcement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating 
to,  or change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Plan
which  would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above
the level  of the expense incurred therefor for the most recently completed
fiscal year  of  the Company.

 

 

(k) _Claims_. There  are no material pending, or to the knowledge of the
Company threatened, material  claims by or on behalf of any Company Plan, by
any employee or beneficiary  covered under any Company Plan, or otherwise
involving any Company Plan (other  than routine claims for benefits).

 

 

(l) _No  Foreign Company Plans_. No Company Plan is maintained for the 
benefit of employees outside of the United States or is otherwise subject to 
the  laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or a political
subdivision  thereof.

 

 

(m) _Options_. All  Options have an exercise price per share that was not
less than the "fair market  value" of a share of Company Common Stock on the
date of grant, as determined  in  accordance with the terms of the
applicable plan, program, agreement or  arrangement maintained by the Company
to provide for grants of equity-based  awards and, to the extent applicable,
Sections 409A and 422 of the  Code. All Options have been properly accounted
for by the Company in  accordance with GAAP, and no change is expected in
respect of any prior Company  Financial Statement relating to expenses for
stock  compensation. There is no pending audit, investigation or inquiry by 
any Governmental Authority or by the Company with respect to the Company\'s 
stock  option granting practices or other equity compensation practices.

(a) As  of the  date of this Agreement, except for employees represented by
the International  Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union and the United
Association of Plumbers  and Pipefitters, no employee of the Company or any

organization or group of employees  of  the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition  or certification, and

five years, neither the Company nor any  of  the Company Subsidiaries has
experienced any strike, work stoppage, lock-up,  slow-down or other material
labor dispute;

 

 

(c) neither  the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has to its

(d) the  Company and the Company Subsidiaries are (a) in compliance in all
material  respects with all federal and state laws respecting employment and
employment  practices, terms and conditions of employment, collective
bargaining,  immigration, wages, hours and benefits, non-discrimination in
employment,  workers compensation, the collection and payment of withholding
and/or payroll  taxes and similar taxes (except for any non-compliance which,

result in a Company Material  Adverse Effect), including but not limited to
the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  the  Age Discrimination in Employment Act of
1967, the Equal Employment Opportunity  Act of 1972, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, the Equal  Pay  Act, the National Labor

Mellon Investor  Services LLC), as Rights Agent, (the "Rights Agreement") as
in effect on the  date of this Agreement. The Company has (i) taken all
action  necessary so that the entering into of this Agreement and the Stock
Purchase  Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby  (including the Merger) and thereby do not and will not result in the
ability  of  any Person to exercise any rights under the Rights Agreement or
enable or  require the Company rights to separate from the shares of Company
Common Stock  to which they are attached or to be triggered or become
exercisable; and (ii)  amended the Rights Agreement in the form of Amendment
No. 1 to the Rights  Agreement, as set forth in Section 4.12 of the Company

Section  4.16 _Absence  of Certain Changes or Event_. Except as expressly
contemplated or  permitted by this Agreement, since December 31, 2006, the
Company and each  of  the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in  the  ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice and there has not  been  any change or development or
combination of developments affecting the Company  or any Company Subsidiary,
of which the Company has knowledge, that would,  individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Company  Material Adverse
Effect.

 

 

Section  4.17 _Vote  Required_. Subject to Section 8.3(e), the approval of
the Merger  by two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of
outstanding  shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Shareholders\'
Approval") is the  only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
capital stock or any  other securities of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries required  to  approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated  hereby.

 

 

Section  4.18 _Opinion  of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the
opinion of  Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated, dated October 25, 2007, to the
effect  that the Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of view
to the  holders of Company Common Stock, a copy of which opinion has been
delivered  to  the Parent or will be delivered to the Parent promptly
following the date of  this Agreement. It is agreed and understood that such
opinion may not  be relied on by the Parent or the Merger Sub.

 

 

Section  4.19 _Insurance_. Except  for failures to maintain insurance or
self-insurance that, individually or  in  the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a  Company Material Adverse Effect,
since January 1, 2004 each of the Company  and  its Subsidiaries and their
respective properties and assets has been  continuously insured with
financially responsible insurers or has self-insured,  in each case in such
amounts and with respect to such risks and losses as (i)  are required by
applicable law or by the Company\'s Material Contracts and (ii)  are
customary for companies in the United States of America conducting the 
business conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge 
of  the Company, there is no condition specific to the Company or its
Subsidiaries  which would prevent the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
from obtaining  insurance policies for such risks and losses. All material
insurance  policies of the Company and each Company Subsidiary are in full
force and  effect. All premiums due and payable through the date hereof
under  all such policies and Contracts have been paid and the Company and
its  Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance in all respects with the terms
of  such  policies and Contracts, except for such failures to be in
compliance which  would  not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company  Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company
nor any of its  Subsidiaries has received any notice of cancellation or
termination with respect  to any such policy or Contract, except with respect
to any cancellation or  termination that, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not  reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section  4.20 _Hedging  Activities_.

 

 

(a) The  Company has established risk parameters, limits and guidelines in
compliance  with the risk management policy approved by the Company Board
of  Directors (or committee thereof) (the "Company Hedging Guidelines") to
(i)  restrict the level of risk that the Company and its Subsidiaries are
authorized  to take with respect to, among other things, the net position
resulting from  all  physical and financial electricity contacts, natural
gas hedge contracts, gas  adjustment clauses, exchange-traded futures and
options transactions,  over-the-counter transactions and derivatives thereof,
interest rate swap  agreements, and similar transactions (the "Company Net
Position") and (ii)  monitor compliance with the Company Hedging Guidelines
by the Company and its  Subsidiaries with such risk parameters. The Company
has provided the  Company Hedging Guidelines to the Parent prior to the date
hereof.

 

 

(b) (i)  The  Company Net Position is within the risk parameters that are
set forth in the  Company Hedging Guidelines and (ii) the exposure of the
Company and its  Subsidiaries with respect to the Company Net Position
resulting from all  transactions described in Section 4.20(a) would not
reasonably be expected  to  result in a material loss to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,  based on market prices in existence as of
the date hereof. Since  December 31, 2006, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has, in  accordance with its mark-to-market accounting policies,
experienced an aggregate  net loss in its hedging and related operations that
would be material to the  Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
taking into account the  recognition of any underlying commodity sales and
the regulatory treatment  and  allowances for hedge transactions.

made available to the Parent disclosure  regarding the amount of any such
fee.

are regulated by  a  Governmental Authority, (i) has rates which have been

proceeding pending before  a  Governmental Authority or on appeal to the
courts, or (ii) except as identified  in Section 4.8 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, is a party to any proceeding  before a Governmental
Authority or on appeal from orders of a Governmental  Authority, in each case
which individually or in the aggregate, have resulted  in  or would

Energy and its indirect wholly-owned exempt wholesale generator subsidiary 
Black  Creek Hydro, Inc. ("BCH") **** are each a "public utility"  within
the meaning of Section 201(e) of the FPA. Puget Sound Energy  is not

the  extent that Puget Sound Energy makes natural gas sales for resale in
interstate  commerce, it has a limited jurisdiction blanket marketing

capacity as Project  Operator of the Jackson Prairie Storage Project (which
otherwise does not  subject it to regulation as a "natural gas company").
Puget Sound Energy  is **** also regulated as a "public service company,"
"gas  company" and "electrical company" under Washington state law. Except 
for regulation of BCH, Hydro Energy Development Corp. ("HEDC") and Puget
Sound  Energy by the FERC under the FPA **,** PUHCA  2005 **** and

similar designation) by the FERC, any state in the United  States or in any
foreign nation. Puget Sound Energy has been  authorized by FERC to make
wholesale sales of energy and capacity at  market-based rates pursuant to
Section 205 of the FPA, which blanket authority  has not been limited in any
material respect through a Puget Sound  Energy-specific rate cap or
mitigation measure. All sales of energy  and/or capacity by BCH are made
pursuant to power sale agreements or tariffs  filed with and accepted by FERC
pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA.

Company  acknowledges that none of the Parent, the Merger Sub, their
respective  affiliates or any other Person acting on behalf of any of them
has made any  representation or warranty, express or implied, including any

businesses, in each case  except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or

the transactions  contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or  limited liability company action on the part of the
Parent and the Merger  Sub. This Agreement has been duly executed and

affecting creditors\' rights and to general equity  principles.

the Merger Sub, or the consummation  by the Parent or the Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except  those that the failure of which to

references in this Agreement to "obtaining" such  Parent Required Statutory
Approvals shall mean making such declarations, filings  or registrations;

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each  of the Parent and
the Merger Sub have all permits, licenses, franchises and  other governmental
authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to conduct  their businesses

impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

default in the performance or observance of any term or  provision of, and no
event has occurred which, with lapse of time or action  by a  third party,

governing documents, as applicable, or (ii) any contract, commitment, 
agreement, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease, bond, license, 
approval or other instrument to which they are respectively a party or by
which  the Parent or the Merger Sub is bound or to which any of their
respective  property is subject, except for possible violations, breaches or
defaults which,  individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely

materially impair the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

organization,  incorporation, capitalization or negotiation and consummation

by any court, governmental department, commission, agency,  instrumentality
or authority or any arbitrator pending or threatened against,  relating to or
affecting the Parent or the Merger Sub which, individually or  in  the
aggregate, have resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in  a

impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, 
and  there are no judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or orders of any
court,  governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or

Section  5.6 _Financing_. The  Financing Commitments (as defined below) are
sufficient (i) to pay the aggregate  Merger Consideration (and any repayment
or refinancing of debt contemplated  by  this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments) in accordance with Article II  hereof and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated  hereby, and (ii) to pay all
fees and expenses and any other amounts required  to  be paid by the Parent
and the Merger Sub in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement. The Parent has delivered to the  Company true and complete copies
of (i) each commitment letter, dated as of  the  date hereof, between the
Parent and the bank or banks identified in the  commitment letters delivered
to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement  (each such bank or banks,
the "Lender") (all such letters, collectively, the  "Debt Financing
Commitment"), pursuant to which the Lender has committed,  subject to the
terms thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein (the "Debt  Financing"),
and (ii) the Commitment Agreement, dated as of the date hereof,  among
Parent, Padua Intermediate and the members of Parent (the "Commitment 
Agreement" and together with the Debt Financing Commitment, the "Financing 
Commitments"), pursuant to which such parties have committed, subject to the 
terms thereof, to invest the cash amounts set forth therein (the "Investor 
Financing" and together with the Debt Financing, the  "Financing"). Prior to
the date of this Agreement, (i) none of the  Financing Commitments have been
amended or modified, and (ii) the respective  commitments contained in the
Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn  or  rescinded in any respect.
The Financing Commitments are in full force  and effect and are the legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Parent and  the Merger Sub and, to the
knowledge of the Parent, of the other parties  thereto. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  one or more Debt Financing
Commitments may, in accordance with the provisions  of  this Agreement, be
superseded at the option of the Parent after the date of  this  Agreement
but prior to the Effective Time by instruments replacing existing  Debt 
Financing Commitments that do not (a) expand upon the conditions precedent 
to  the Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment and (b) do
not  otherwise prevent or delay the Closing or otherwise materially impair
the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder (such
instruments,  the  "New Debt Financing Commitments"). In such event, the
term "Financing  Commitments" as used herein shall be deemed to include the
Financing Commitments  that are not so superseded at the time in question and
the New Debt Financing  Commitments to the extent then in effect. There are
no conditions  precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount  of  the Financing, other than as set forth in or contemplated
by the Financing  Commitments. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred
that, with  or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the  part  of the Parent or the Merger Sub under any of the
Financing  Commitments. As of the date hereof, the Parent has no reason to 
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the 
Financing Commitments will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not 
be  made available to the Parent on the Closing Date.

 

 

Section  5.7 _Solvency_. As  of the Effective Time, assuming (i)
satisfaction of the conditions to the  Parent\'s and the Merger Sub\'s
obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver  of  such conditions, (ii)
the accuracy of the representations and warranties of  the  Company set
forth in Article IV hereof (for such purposes, such representations  and
warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects without giving 
effect to any "knowledge," materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" 
qualification or exception) and (iii) estimates, projections or forecasts 
provided by the Company to the Parent prior to the date hereof have been 
prepared in good faith on assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable,  and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement,  including the Financing, and the payment of the Merger
Consideration, any other  repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness
contemplated in this Agreement  or the Financing Commitments, payment of all
amounts required to be paid in  connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and  payment of all related fees and
expenses, each of the Parent and the Surviving  Corporation will be Solvent
as of the Effective Time and immediately after  the  consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. For the  purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Solvent" when used with respect to the  Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, means that, as of any date of  determination (a) the amount of
the "fair saleable value" of the assets of  the  Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will, as of such date, exceed (without  duplication) (i) the
value of all "liabilities of the Parent and the Surviving  Corporation,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date,  as  such
quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable federal 
Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the
amount  that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of the Parent
and the  Surviving Corporation on their existing debts (including contingent
and other  liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) the
Parent and the  Surviving Corporation will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small  amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which they intend  to  engage or propose to be engaged following the Closing
Date, and (c) the Parent  and the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay
their liabilities, including  contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature. For purposes of  this definition, "not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the  operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged"  and "able to pay its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities,  as  they mature" means that the Parent
and the Surviving Corporation will be able  to  generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or  a  combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due.

 

 

Section  5.8 _Absence  of Certain Agreements_. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither  the Parent nor any of its affiliates has entered into any
agreement, arrangement  or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), or authorized,  committed or agreed to enter into any such
agreement, arrangement or  understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), pursuant to which: (i)  any shareholder of the Company would be
entitled to receive consideration of  a  different amount or nature than the
Merger Consideration or pursuant to which  any shareholder of the Company
agrees to vote to approve this Agreement or  the  Merger or agrees to vote
against any Superior Proposal; (ii) other than  investment funds or other
entities under common management with any of the  members of the Parent, any
third party has agreed to provide, directly or  indirectly, equity capital
(other than pursuant to the Commitment Agreement,  pursuant to the Stock
Purchase Agreement, or as set forth in Section 5.8 of  the  Parent
Disclosure Letter) to the Parent or the Company to finance in whole  or in 
part the Merger; or (iii) any current employee of the Company has agreed to 
remain as an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries following
the  Effective Time.

other than with  respect to the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions
contemplated  thereby, neither the Parent, the Merger Sub nor any of their
respective  affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the

directors of the  Parent and the Merger Sub) (i) beneficially owns (as
defined in Rule 13d-3  under  the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, or
(ii) is a party to any agreement,  arrangement or understanding for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting  or  disposing of, in each case,
shares of capital stock of the  Company. With respect to Macquarie Bank
Limited, this representation  shall be limited to the knowledge of the
Corporate Finance Division of Macquarie  Securities (USA) Inc.

 

 

Section  5.10 _Brokers  and Finders_. The Parent has not entered into any
agreement or  arrangement entitling any agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor  or  other firm or Person to any broker\'s or finder\'s
fee or any other commission  or  similar fee in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, except Macquarie Securities
(USA) Inc., whose fees and expenses  will  be paid by the Parent in
accordance with the Parent\'s agreement with such  firm.

 

 

Section  5.11 _No  Additional Representations of Company and Company 
Subsidiaries_. The Parent and the Merger Sub acknowledge that none  of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, their respective affiliates or any  other 
Person acting on behalf of any of them has made (i) any representation or 
warranty, express or implied, including any implied representation or
warranty  as to the condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a
particular  purpose of any of the Assets (as defined below) of or held by the
Company or  any  Company Subsidiary, or (ii) any representation or warranty,
express or implied,  as to the accuracy or completeness of any information
regarding the Company,  the  Company Subsidiaries, any of their respective
affiliates or businesses, in  each  case except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement or as and to the extent  required by this Agreement to be
disclosed on the Company Disclosure Letter  hereto. The Parent and the Merger
Sub further agree that none of the  Company, any Company Subsidiary, their
respective affiliates or any other Person  acting on behalf of any of them
will have or be subject to any liability, except  in the case of fraud or as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, to the  Parent, the Merger Sub or
any other Person resulting from the distribution  to  the Parent, for the
Parent\'s use, of any information, document or material  made  available to
the Parent in certain "data rooms" (whether electronic or  otherwise),
management presentations or any other form in expectation of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As used in this  Agreement, the
term "Assets" shall mean all of the Company\'s and Company  Subsidiaries\'
right, title and interest in and to the business, properties,  assets and
rights of any kind, whether tangible or intangible, real or personal,  and
constituting, or used in connection with, or related to, the business owned 
by the Company or a Company Subsidiary or in which the Company or a Company 
Subsidiary has any interest.

 

 

Section  5.12 _No  Other Representations of the Parent and the Merger Sub_.
Except  for the representations and warranties contained in this Article V,
none of  the  Parent, the Merger Sub or any other Person acting on behalf of

Section  6.1 _Covenants  of the Company_. After the date hereof and prior to
the Effective  Time or earlier termination of this Agreement, the Company
agrees, each as  to  itself and to each of the Company Subsidiaries, (A) to
conduct its business  in a  manner substantially consistent in all material
respects with the assumptions  regarding capital expenditures, refinancings
and securities issuances set forth  in Item 36 of Section 6.1 of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the "Business Plan  Assumptions ") which were used in the
preparation of the business plan for  the  Company and its Subsidiaries
dated as of the date hereof and delivered  concurrently herewith to the
Parent (the "Business Plan") (provided, however,  that in doing so, the
Company makes no representation or warranty that any  projections set forth
in, or results expected by, such business plan will be  achieved nor does the
Company covenant that it will ultimately achieve any  such  projections or
expected results) and (B) as follows, except (i) as set forth  in  Section
6.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter, (ii) as otherwise expressly  permitted
by this Agreement, (iii) as contemplated by the Business Plan  Assumptions,
(iv) as may be reasonably responsive to requirements of applicable  law, or
(v) to the extent the Parent shall otherwise consent in writing, which 
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed:

 

 

(a) the  business of the Company and each Company Subsidiary shall be
conducted in the  ordinary and usual course in substantially the same manner
as heretofore  conducted and, to the extent consistent therewith, the Company
and each Company  Subsidiary shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to  preserve their business organizations intact, to
maintain their existing  relations and goodwill with customers, suppliers,
creditors, regulators,  lessors, employees and business associates and to
maintain in effect all  material governmental permits, franchises and other
authorizations pursuant  to  which the Company or any Company Subsidiaries
operate; provided, however, that  the Company and/or wholly-owned, direct or
indirect, Company Subsidiaries may  enter into intercompany transactions and
intercompany reorganizations that  do  not have adverse effects on the
Company or such Company Subsidiaries (other  than  the fact that any such
transaction or reorganization has taken  place);

 

 

(b) the  Company shall not and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to
(i) issue,  sell, pledge, dispose of or encumber any capital stock owned by
it in any of  the  Company Subsidiaries; (ii) amend its articles of

reclassify its outstanding shares  of  capital stock; (iv) declare, set
aside or pay any dividend payable in cash,  stock or property in respect of
any capital stock other than regular quarterly  cash dividends on Company
Common Stock in amounts no greater than $0.25 per  share per quarter
(provided, however, that any such dividend for the quarter  during which the
Closing occurs shall be prorated based on the number of days  from the
immediately preceding dividend record date to the Closing Date) and 
dividends on any preferred stock of the Company or Puget Sound Energy; (v) 
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire (except for (A) mandatory sinking
fund  obligations existing on the date hereof, and (B) redemptions,
purchases,  acquisitions or issuances required by the respective terms of any
Company Plan,  in the ordinary course of the operation of such plans
consistent with past  practice), or permit any of its Subsidiaries to
purchase or otherwise acquire,  any shares of its capital stock or any
securities convertible into or  exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of
its capital stock, or (vi) fund  the Company\'s direct stock purchase and
dividend reinvestment plan with  authorized but unissued shares of Company
Common Stock; provided, however,  that  this Section 6.1(b) shall not
restrict any dividends from any wholly-owned,  direct or indirect, Company
Subsidiary nor shall it restrict the Company\'s  ability to dissolve,
liquidate or wind-up any wholly-owned, direct or indirect,  Company
Subsidiary that the Company deems to be no longer useful and the 
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of which would not result in any
adverse  effect on the Company or any such Company Subsidiary (other than the
fact that  any such dissolution, liquidation or winding up has taken place);
provided  further, that if any Purchaser, as defined in the Stock Purchase
Agreement,  shall default with respect to its obligations thereunder, the
Company shall  be  released from the restriction under Section 6.1(b)(i)
hereof to the extent  required to sell to any other Person the number of
shares of Company Common  Stock which were not purchased pursuant to the
Stock Purchase  Agreement;

 

 

(c) neither  the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall (i) issue, sell,
pledge, dispose  of  or encumber any shares of, or securities convertible
into or exchangeable or  exercisable for, or options, warrants, calls,
commitments or rights of any  kind  to acquire, any shares of its capital
stock of any class or any other property  or assets (other than (A) shares
issuable pursuant to options outstanding on  the  date hereof under the
Company Plans and additional options or rights to acquire  shares required by
the terms of any Company Plan as in effect on the date hereof  in the
ordinary course of the operation of such Company Plan and (B) issuances  of
securities in connection with grants or awards of stock-based compensation 
made in accordance with Section 6.1(d) hereof); (ii) other than in the
ordinary  and usual course of business in amounts not in excess of $50
million in the  aggregate, and except for (A) long-term indebtedness incurred
in connection  with  the refinancing of existing indebtedness either at or
shortly before its  maturity or at a lower cost of funds, and (B) short term
debt incurred under  the  Company\'s existing credit facilities, transfer,
lease, license, guarantee,  sell,  mortgage, pledge, dispose of or encumber
any other material property or material  assets (including capital stock of
any Company Subsidiary) or incur, assume  or  modify any indebtedness or
other material liability; or (iii) make any  commitments for, make or
authorize any capital expenditures in excess of 115%  of  budgeted amounts;

 

 

(d) neither  the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall (x) terminate,
establish, adopt,  enter into, make any new grants or awards of stock-based
compensation or other  benefits under, amend or otherwise modify any Company
Plan or increase the  salary, wage, bonus or other compensation of any
directors, officers or  employees, except (i) for grants or awards to
directors, officers and employees  under existing Company Plans in such
amounts and on such terms as are consistent  with past practice, (ii) in the
normal and usual course of business (which  shall  include normal periodic
performance reviews and related plans and the provision  of individual

employees of new Company Subsidiaries in amounts and on terms consistent 
with past practice) or (iii) for actions necessary to satisfy existing 
contractual obligations under Company Plans existing as of the date hereof, 
or  as required by law or as required to bring any Company Plan into
compliance  with  Section 409A; or (y) grant any new severance or
termination pay not in existence  on the date hereof or enter into any new
severance agreement not in existence  on  the date hereof;

(f) the  Company shall not make or implement, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries  not to make or implement, any changes to the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\'  rates or charges, standards of service or regulatory

pursuant to routine filings made  in  the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, provided that  a  general rate case will not
be considered a routine filing for purposes of this  Section 6.1(f), (ii)
with respect to the filing of the proceeding at the WUTC  expected to be
initiated by Puget Sound Energy in December 2007 to increase  or  otherwise
change rates, charges or revenue requirements for transmission,  distribution
or generation services (the "2007 WUTC Rate Case"); or (iii) as  required by
a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction. The  Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver to the Parent a  copy  of each such
filing or agreement at least four (4) business days prior to (or  as  soon
as reasonably practicable thereafter) the filing or execution  thereof;

 

 

(g) the  Company shall not, and shall not cause or allow the Company
Subsidiaries to,  make or change any material Tax election, change or consent
to any material  change in the Company\'s or such Company Subsidiary\'s
method of accounting for  Tax purposes, settle or compromise any dispute,
claim or assessment regarding  a  Tax liability, if the settlement or
compromise of such dispute, claim or  assessment could result in the payment
(either currently or over time, including  by way of increased Tax liability
of the Company and/or any Company Subsidiary,  regardless of whether the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has losses to offset  such increase) by the
Company and/or any Company Subsidiary of $10 million  individually or $20

practice; provided in each  case  that the Company and any Company
Subsidiary shall be permitted to renew or  replace any Material Contract with
one or more Contracts on substantially  similar terms at current market
prices;

 

 

(j) the  Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to,

ADDITIONAL  AGREEMENTS

 

 

Section  7.1 _Access  to Company Information_. Upon reasonable advance
notice, the  Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to,
afford to the  officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel,
investment bankers,  financial advisors and other representatives
(collectively, "Representatives")  of the Parent reasonable access during
normal business hours throughout the  period prior to the Effective Time, to
all of its employees, properties, books,  contracts, commitments and records
(including, but not limited to, tax returns)  and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company  Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly
to the Parent and its Representative, (i)  access to each report, schedule
and other document filed or received by the  Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of  federal or state securities
laws or filed with or sent to the SEC, FERC, the  Department of Justice, the
Federal Trade Commission or any other federal or  state regulatory agency or
commission and (ii) access to all information  concerning the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, and their respective  directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably  requested by the
Parent or its Representatives in connection with any filings,  applications
or approvals required or contemplated by this Agreement or for  any  other
reason related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  provided,
however, that in no event shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary  be
obligated to provide any access or information if the Company or the Company 
Subsidiary reasonably determines, in good faith after consultation with
counsel,  that providing such access or information is likely to violate
applicable law,  cause either the Company or any Company Subsidiary to breach
a confidentiality  obligation to which it is bound or jeopardize any
recognized privilege available  to either the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. The Parent agrees to  indemnify and hold the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries harmless from any  and all claims and liabilities,
including costs and expenses for loss, injury  to  or death of any
Representative of the Parent, and any damage to or destruction  of any
property owned by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or  others
(including claims or liabilities for loss of use of any property)  resulting
from the action of any of the Representatives of the Parent (other  than as
directed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their  respective
Representatives) during any visit to the business or property sites  of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, whether 
pursuant to this Section 7.1 or otherwise. During any visit to the  business
or property sites of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,  the
Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives accessing such properties 
to, comply with all applicable laws and all of the Company\'s and the
Company  Subsidiaries\' safety and security procedures and conduct itself in
a manner  that  would not be reasonably expected to interfere with the
operation, maintenance  or  repair of the assets of the Company or such
Company  Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the 
Parent shall not have the right to conduct environmental sampling or testing 
on  any of the properties of the Company or the Company  Subsidiaries. Each
party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and  Representatives to, hold
in strict confidence all documents and information  concerning the other
furnished to it in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the Non-Disclosure Agreement,  dated July 20,
2007, entered into by and between the Company and Macquarie  Securities (USA)
Inc. (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

 

 

Section  7.2 _Proxy  Statement_. The proxy statement and any amendment
thereof or  supplement thereto, to be sent to the shareholders of the Company
in connection  with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement") will comply in all
material respects  with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and  regulations thereunder. The Company will prepare and file with
the  SEC, as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the No-Shop Period
Start  Date, the Proxy Statement in a form that complies in all material
respects  with  the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated  thereunder. Each of the Parent and the Merger Sub
shall furnish to  the Company all information requested concerning itself
which is reasonably  required or customary for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement including, without  limitation, the form of articles of
incorporation for the Surviving Corporation  to be attached to the Articles
of Merger. The Company and the Parent  each agrees to respond as promptly as
is practicable to any comments of the  SEC  on the Proxy Statement and the
Company agrees to mail the Proxy Statement to  holders of Company Common
Stock promptly after the Company learns that the  Proxy  Statement will not
be reviewed or that the SEC staff has no further comments  thereon. The
information provided by any party hereto for use in or  incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement shall be true and correct  in  all material
respects, at the dates mailed to shareholders of the Company and  at  the
time of the Company Meeting (as defined below), without omission of any 
material fact which is required to make such information not false or 
misleading. No representation, covenant or agreement is made by any  party
hereto with respect to information supplied in writing by any other party 
specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. If at any time  prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to the Company, the Parent  or
the Merger Sub, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors,  should be discovered by the Company, the Parent or the Merger Sub
which should  be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that  the  Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit  to  state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in light  of  the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which  discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and  an  appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be  promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by law, disseminated  to  the shareholders of
the Company.

 

 

Section  7.3 _Regulatory  Matters_.

 

 

(a) _HSR  Filings_. Each party hereto shall, as soon as reasonably 
practicable after the date hereof, file or cause to be filed with the
Federal  Trade Commission and the Department of Justice any notifications
required to  be  filed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, as amended  (the "HSR Act"), and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder with  respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Such parties will  use their reasonable best efforts to respond on a timely
basis to any requests  for additional information made by either of such
agencies.

 

 

(b) _Other  Regulatory Approvals_. Each party hereto shall cooperate and
use  its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary 
documentation, (including any material amendments thereto) to effect all 
necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and 
to  use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
permits,  consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental
Authorities necessary  or advisable to obtain the Company Required Statutory
Approvals and the Parent  Required Statutory Approvals prior to the Initial
Termination Date (as defined  in Section 9.1(c)) (as the same may be extended
hereunder); provided, however,  that the Company and the Parent shall file
the Company Required Statutory  Approvals and the Parent Required Statutory
Approvals, respectively, as promptly  as is reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, taking into account the  efforts of the Company and the
Representatives in accordance with Section  7.9(a). The Parent and the
Company shall file as promptly as  practicable a joint voluntary notice in
respect of the transactions contemplated  hereby under Section 721 of the
Defense Production Act of 1950 as amended by  Section 5021 of the Omnibus
Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, and as  amended by The Foreign
Investment National Security Act of  2007 **** ("Exon-Florio"). Each party
hereto shall  cooperate and use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
as promptly  as  reasonably practicable all necessary permits, consents,
approvals and  authorizations of all Governmental Authorities necessary or
advisable to obtain  the Company Required Statutory Approvals and the Parent
Required Statutory  Approvals and under Exon-Florio. Each party shall have
the right to  review a reasonable time in advance and to provide comments on
any filing  (including any material amendments thereto) made after the date
hereof and  until  the Initial Termination Date (as the same may be extended
hereunder) by the  other party or a Subsidiary of any party with any
Governmental Authority with  respect to the Merger or the 2007 WUTC Rate Case
and the party or Subsidiary  making such filing shall give reasonable
consideration to any changes suggested  for such filing. In addition, the
Company shall consult with the  Parent prior to making any regulatory filing
(including any material amendments  thereto) with the WUTC or FERC, except
for routine filings made in the ordinary  course of business consistent with
past practice, provided that a general rate  case will not be considered a
routine filing for purposes of this Section  7.3(b), and provided that the
Company will consult with the Parent regarding  specific routine filings as
reasonably requested by the Parent, and to keep  the  Parent reasonably
informed about material developments and requests from the  WUTC or FERC with
respect to such filings; provided, however, that in connection  with any such
consultation the Parent shall not be entitled to direct or manage  any
decisions or activities of the Company. The Parent agrees that if  actions to
maintain the credit ratings of Puget Sound Energy at current levels  appear
to be advisable that the Parent will endeavor to work with the Company  and
the Parent\'s members in good faith to procure the agreement of its members 
to take or approve commercially reasonable actions to maintain that  rating.

 

 

(c) The  Company and the Parent each shall, upon request by the other,
furnish the other  with all true and accurate information concerning itself,
its Subsidiaries,  directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably  necessary or advisable in connection with the
Proxy Statement, or any other  statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of the Parent,  the  Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority  in  connection with the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

(d) The  Company and the Parent each shall promptly provide the other party
with copies  of all filings made by any of the Company, the Parent or any of
their  Subsidiaries with any federal or state court, administrative agency,
commission  or other Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement
and the  transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and the Parent each 
shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion  of  the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly
furnishing the other  with copies of any notices or other communications
received by the Parent or  the  Company, as the case may be, or any of its
Subsidiaries, from any third party  and/or any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company and the  Parent each shall give prompt notice to the
other of any change that would  reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Parent  Material Adverse Effect, respectively.

 

 

(e) In  the  event any claim, action, suit, investigation, legal or
administrative proceeding  is commenced by any Governmental Authority or
Person (other than to the Company,  the Parent or any of their Subsidiaries)
that questions the validity or legality  of this Agreement, or the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement or claims damages in
connection therewith, the Company and the Parent  each agree to cooperate and
use their reasonable best efforts to defend against  and respond thereto.

 

 

(f) The  Company, the Parent and the Merger Sub agree (i) that the
application submitted  to the WUTC with respect to the Merger shall include
the information concerning  the Merger, the Company, the Parent and the
Merger Sub required by Sections  480-143-120, 480-143-140 and 480-143-150 of
the Washington Administrative Code,  (ii) to include specific commitments and
agreements in such application to  implement the principles set forth in
Exhibit B hereto, and (iii) that the  initial application submitted to the
WUTC with respect to the Merger and any  amendment thereto shall only include
such other agreements or commitments as  agreed to by the Company, the Parent
and the Merger Sub, in each case, whose  consent to any such agreements or
commitments shall not be unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Company agrees that it will not  agree to, or accept, any additional or
different agreements, commitments or  conditions in connection with the
Merger pursuant to any settlement or otherwise  with the Staff of the WUTC or
any other Person without the prior written consent  of the Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned  or  delayed.

 

 

(g) The  Parent and the Merger Sub agree not to seek to acquire or acquire
any regulated  electric or gas distribution utility in the State of
Washington, other than  the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
that would present a significant  risk of materially delaying or making it
materially more difficult for the  Parent, the Merger Sub or the Company to
obtain the approval of the WUTC with  respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (any such  acquisition, a "Contrary Action").

 

 

(h) Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement, but subject to
any obligation included  in  Exhibit B, in connection with the Parent\'s
obligations set forth in this Section  7.3, the Parent and the Merger Sub
shall not be required to cause any member  of  the Parent or any director,
officer, employee, general partner, limited partner,  member or manager of
any member of the Parent, in each case in his, her or  its  individual
capacity, to either (A) take any action, or undertake the divestiture  of any
asset, property or company that is not regulated by the WUTC and that  would
be material for a company the size of the Company or (B) restrict in  any 
material respect the ability of any member of the Parent or any affiliate of 
any  such member to exercise its rights of ownership with respect to its
investment  in the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries,
other than,  in  accordance with the agreements and commitments set forth on
Exhibit B, to  provide responsive information required to make any submission
or application  to  a Governmental Authority and to otherwise cooperate in
connection with any  such  submission or application as is necessary and
customary under the  circumstances.

 

 

Section  7.4 _Approval  of the Company Shareholders_. The Company shall, as
soon as  reasonably practicable after the No-Shop Period Start Date, (i) take
all steps  necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its  shareholders (the "Company Meeting") for the purpose of securing the
Company  Shareholders\' Approval, (ii) distribute to its shareholders the
Proxy Statement  in accordance with applicable federal and state law and with
its articles of  incorporation and by-laws, (iii) subject to Section 7.9,
recommend to its  shareholders the approval of the Merger, this Agreement and
the transactions  contemplated hereby and (iv) cooperate and consult with the
Parent with respect  to each of the foregoing matters.

 

 

Section  7.5 _Directors\'  and Officers\' Indemnification_.

 

 

(a) _Indemnification_. From  and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest  extent permitted by applicable law,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each  Person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof, or who  becomes prior to the Effective
Time, an officer or director of the Company  or  any Company Subsidiary
(each an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the  "Indemnified Parties")
against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable  attorney\'s fees and
expenses), claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to  the  proviso of
the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising  out  of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and
whether  asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the
extent  that  they are based on or arising out of the fact that such Person
is or was a  director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (the  "Indemnified Liabilities"), and (ii) all Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent  they are based on or arise out of or pertain to
the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement. In the event of any such
loss, expense, claim, damage  or liability (whether or not asserted before
the Effective Time), (i) the  Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel  selected by the Indemnified Parties, which
counsel shall be reasonably  satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation,
promptly after statements therefor  are received and otherwise advance to
such Indemnified Party upon request,  reimbursement of documented expenses
reasonably incurred, in either case to  the  extent not prohibited by the
business corporation law of the Surviving  Corporation\'s state of
incorporation, (ii) the Surviving Corporation and the  Indemnified Parties
will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii)  any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified  Party\'s conduct
complies with the standards set forth under the business  corporation law of
the Surviving Corporation\'s state of incorporation and the  articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be  made  by
independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and 
the  Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation
shall  not  be liable for any settlement effected without its written
consent (which consent  shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified
Parties as a  group may retain only one law firm with respect to each related
matter except  to  the extent there is, in the opinion of counsel to an
Indemnified Party, under  applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict on any significant  issue between positions of such Indemnified
Party and any other Indemnified  Party or Indemnified Parties.

 

 

(b) _Insurance_. The  Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation either (i)
to maintain in effect  for the six-year period commencing immediately after
the Effective Time (and  for  so long thereafter as any claims brought
before the end of such six-year period  thereunder are being adjudicated) the
Company\'s current directors\' and officers\'  liability insurance (the
"Existing DandO Coverage") covering acts or omissions  occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time with respect to those individuals  who are as of the date
hereof (and any additional individuals who prior to  the  Effective Time
become) covered by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\'  liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage, and in  amount, no
less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries thereof than those  of  such
policy in effect on the date hereof (or the Parent may cause the Surviving 
Corporation to substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, 
of at  least the same coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective  Time); provided that if the aggregate annual premiums for such
insurance shall  exceed two hundred per cent (200%) of the aggregate annual
premiums paid by  the  Company as of the date hereof, then the Parent shall
cause the Surviving  Corporation to provide or cause to be provided a policy
for the applicable  individuals with the best coverage as shall then be
available at an annual  premium of two hundred per cent (200%) of the current
aggregate annual premium  or (ii) to purchase a six-year extended reporting
period endorsement ("reporting  tail coverage") under the Existing DandO
Coverage, provided that such  reporting tail coverage shall extend the
director and officer liability coverage  in force as of the date hereof from
the Effective Time on terms, that in all  material respects, are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries  thereof than the existing
directors\' and officers\' liability  insurance.

 

 

(c) _Successors_. In  the event the Surviving Corporation, the Parent or any
of their respective  successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person  and  shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such  consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its  properties and assets to any Person, then and in
either such case, proper  provisions shall be made so that the successors,
assigns and/or transferees  of  the Surviving Corporation or the Parent
shall assume the obligations set forth  in this Section 7.5; provided that
this Section 7.5(c) shall no longer apply  to  the Parent if reporting tail
coverage meeting the requirements of Section 7.5(b)  shall have been
purchased by the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(d) _Survival  of Indemnification_. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
from  and after the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification as of the
date  hereof in favor of the employees, agents, directors and officers of the
Company,  the Company Subsidiaries with respect to their activities as such
prior to,  on  or after the Effective Time, as provided in their respective
articles of  incorporation and by-laws in effect on the date thereof, or
otherwise in effect  on the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force  and effect for a period of not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time,  provided that, in the event any claim or
claims are asserted or made within  such  survival period, all such rights
to indemnification in respect to any claim  or  claims shall continue until
final disposition of such claim or  claims.

 

 

(e) _Benefit_. The  provisions of this Section 7.5 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall  be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs, executors or  administrators and his or her representatives.

 

 

Section  7.6 _Public  Announcements_. Except as may be required by law or by
obligations  pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities  exchange, the Company and the Parent shall consult with each
other prior to  issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect  to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement. Each of the Company and the Parent will, to
the extent  practicable, provide the other, reasonably in advance of its use,
with drafts  of  any press release or other widely disseminated presentation
or other  information, in each case relating to the Merger or material
corporate and  financial information relating to the Company, and give
reasonable consideration  to the comments of the other thereon. In connection
with the  foregoing, the Company and the Parent may share any such drafts
with their  respective investors and Representatives provided that any such
investors or  Representatives are bound by an obligation to maintain the
confidentiality  of  such information sufficient to satisfy the requirements
of Regulation FD  promulgated under the Securities Act. Each of the Company
and the  Parent will advise the other in advance of the timing of any such
press release,  presentation or other information relating to the Merger and
will provide the  other with a final copy of the same simultaneously with its
public  release.

 

 

Section  7.7 _Employee  Agreements and Workforce Matters_.

 

 

(a) _Certain  Employee Agreements_. The Parent shall cause the Surviving 
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, without modification, all
collective  bargaining agreements in effect as of the date hereof, and the
Parent shall  cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor
all contracts  and  agreements of the parties in effect as of the date
hereof that apply to any  current or former employee or current or former
director or consultant of the  parties hereto; provided, however, that,
except to the extent otherwise provided  in Section 7.8, this undertaking is
not intended to prevent the Surviving  Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
from enforcing such contracts, agreements  and collective bargaining
agreements in accordance with their terms, including,  without limitation,
any reserved right to amend, modify, suspend, revoke or  terminate any such
contract, agreement, collective bargaining agreement or  commitment, or
portion thereof.

 

 

(b) _Workforce  Matters_. Following the Effective Time, the Parent shall
cause the  Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to act in accordance
with all  applicable collective bargaining agreements and all laws and
regulations  governing the employment relationship and termination thereof
including, without  limitation, the WARN Act and regulations promulgated
thereunder, including,  without limitation, the aggregation of employment
losses thereunder, and any  comparable state or local law.

 

 

Section  7.8 _Employee  Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(a) _Continued  Employment; Service Credit_. The Parent shall cause the
Surviving  Corporation to continue the employment of all employees of the
Company and  the  Company Subsidiaries who were employees immediately prior
to the Effective  Time  (the "Affected Employees") through the Effective
Time. The Parent  shall cause all service under any Company Plan that was
recognized, accrued  or  credited under such Company Plan through the
Effective Time to continue to  be  recognized, accrued or credited for the
same purpose(s) such service was  recognized, accrued or credited immediately
prior to the Effective Time under  such Company Plan as of and following the
Effective Time. Subject to  obligations under applicable law and applicable
collective bargaining  agreements, the Parent shall cause all Affected
Employees to be credited with  all service for the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (and all other service  credited by the Company or the Company
Subsidiary or the Company Plans), under  (x) all employee benefit plans,
programs and policies (if any) of the Parent  or  its direct or indirect
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) in  which Affected
Employees become eligible to participate on or after the  Effective Time, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and all  other purposes
(but not for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit  pension plans
or eligibility for early retirement under defined benefit pension  plans and
not to the extent crediting such service would result in duplication  of
benefits) and (y) any severance, vacation, sick leave, paid-time off or 
similar plans, programs or policies of the Parent or its direct or indirect 
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) for purposes of
determining  the amount of each Affected Employee\'s benefits thereunder.
The  Parent shall, and shall cause its direct and indirect Subsidiaries
(including  the Surviving Corporation), or shall use its reasonable efforts
to cause its  insurance carrier, to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions  exclusions and all waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage  requirements applicable to each Affected Employee
under any welfare benefit  plan  in which an Affected Employee becomes
eligible to participate on or after the  Effective Time, except to the extent
of limitations or waiting periods that  are  already in effect under the
Company Plans with respect to the Affected Employee  as of the Effective Time
and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective  Time and (ii) credit
each Affected Employee for any co-payments, deductibles  and  other out-of-
pocket expenses paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying  any 
applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements for the year 
in  which the Effective Time occurs under any welfare plan in which the
Affected  Employee participates on and after the Effective Time. Nothing in 
this Section 7.8 shall be deemed to create any third-party beneficiary or
right  of employment with respect to any Affected Employee. Nothing 
contained in this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to be an amendment 
to  any Company Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or 
arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

 

(b) _Continuation  of Benefits_. Subject to applicable law and obligations
under  applicable collective bargaining agreements, the Parent shall cause
the  Surviving Corporation to maintain for a period of at least one year
after the  Effective Time, without interruption, such employee compensation
and benefit  plans, programs and policies (other than the ESPP, and other
than the Company\'s  other stock or equity based plans and policies so long
as any such other plans  and policies are replaced with compensation, plans
or policies of equivalent  potential value) as will provide compensation and
benefits to each Affected  Employee that in the aggregate are substantially
comparable to those provided  pursuant to the Company Plans as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective  Time; provided, however, that the Parent
shall, for one year following the  Effective Time, continue (or cause the
Surviving Corporation to continue) the  Company\'s Involuntary Separation
Plan for Non-Union Employees (the "Severance  Policy") in full force and
effect to the same extent that such Severance Policy  is in effect on the
date of this Agreement. Except as required by  applicable law, any applicable
collective bargaining agreement or the proviso  in  the preceding sentence,
nothing contained herein shall obligate the Parent,  the  Surviving
Corporation or any of their affiliates to (i) maintain any particular 
Company Plan, (ii) maintain any particular type of Company Plan or (iii)
retain  the employment of any particular employee.

 

 

(c) _Severance  and Change of Control Payments_. Promptly following the
Closing,  the Surviving Corporation shall make full and prompt payment of all
severance  and/or change of control payments due pursuant to the terms of all
applicable  severance agreements and/or change of control agreements listed
on Section  4.10(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter to each applicable 
individual.

 

 

(d) _Communications_. Prior  to making any material written communications to
the directors, officers or  employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or material oral  communications to a group of directors,
officers or employees, pertaining to  compensation or benefit matters that
are affected by the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
shall provide the Parent with a  copy  of the intended communication, the
Parent shall have a reasonable period of  time  to review and comment on the
communication, and the Parent and the Company  shall  cooperate in providing
any such mutually agreeable communication; provided  that  this Section
7.8(d) shall not apply to (i) any communications regarding the  existing
plans and benefits or modifications of the existing plans and benefits 
permitted by Section 6.1; and (ii) any communications that explain or 
describe the provisions of this Agreement or the effects thereof so long as 
such  explanation or description is consistent with the provisions of this 
Agreement.

 

 

Section  7.9 _Acquisition  Proposals_.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period  beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. (PST)  on  December 10, 2007 (the "No-Shop Period Start
Date"), the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall have the right to  directly or indirectly: (i)
initiate, solicit and encourage Acquisition  Proposals (as defined below) (or
inquiries, proposals or offers or other efforts  or attempts that may lead to
an Acquisition Proposal), including by way of  providing access to non-public
information pursuant to (but only pursuant to)  one or more Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreements (as defined below); provided  that the Company
shall promptly provide to the Parent any material non-public  information
concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is provided  to any
Person given such access which was not previously provided to the Parent  or
its Representatives; and (ii) enter into and maintain discussions or 
negotiations with respect to Acquisition Proposals or otherwise cooperate
with  or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals,  discussions or negotiations.

 

 

(b) Subject  to Section 7.9(c), from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the
Effective Time  or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article  IX,  the Company shall not, nor shall it permit any
Company Subsidiaries to, nor  shall it authorize or permit any of its
Representatives to, directly or  indirectly through another Person, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage  (including by way of furnishing
information except information relating to  the  existence of these
provisions), or take any other action designed to facilitate,  directly or
indirectly, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer  with
respect to a merger, reorganization, tender offer, share exchange, 
consolidation or other transaction (x) relating to the direct or indirect 
acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the assets of the Company and the 
Company Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, or to which 20% or more of
the  Company\'s revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
attributable, or  (y)  that would result in a Person beneficially owning 20%
or more of the equity  securities of the Company, in each case, other than by
the Parent or the Merger  Sub (any such proposal or offer, being hereinafter
referred to as an  "Acquisition Proposal" and any such transaction or
purchase being hereinafter  referred to as an "Acquisition Transaction") or
(ii) participate in any  discussions (except as to the existence of these
provisions) or negotiations  relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition  Transaction. Subject to Section 7.9(c) and except with respect
to any  Excluded Party (as defined below), on the No-Shop Period Start Date
the Company  shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation,  encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons
conducted theretofore  by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their respective  Representatives with respect to any Acquisition  Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 7.9 to  the contrary, any
Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all  purposes under
this Agreement at such time as the Acquisition Proposal (as  such 
Acquisition Proposal may be revised during the course of ongoing
negotiations  (in which event it may temporarily cease to satisfy the
requirements of 7.9(c)),  so long as such negotiations are ongoing) made by
such party is withdrawn,  terminated or does not constitute, and could not
reasonably be expected to  result in, a Superior Proposal (as defined below),
as determined by the Board  of  Directors of the Company in good faith,
after consultation with its financial  advisors and outside counsel. For
purposes of this Agreement, an  "Excluded Party" is a Person (or group of
Persons that includes among its  members one or more Persons who (x) were
members of such group prior to the  No-Shop Period Start Date and (y)
collectively constitute at least 50% of the  equity financing of such group
at all times following the No-Shop Period Start  Date and such group of
Persons shall no longer be considered an Excluded Party  for purposes of this
Agreement if it does not meet the requirements of this  parenthetical) from
whom the Company has received a bona fide written  Acquisition Proposal prior
to the No-Shop Period Start Date which the Board  of  Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with  its  financial
advisors and outside counsel, constitutes, or could reasonably be  expected
to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below) as of the No-Shop  Period
Start Date, as determined no later than the No-Shop Period Start  Date.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.9(b) if
at any time prior to  securing the Company Shareholders\' Approval, the Board
of Directors of the  Company determines in good faith, based on the advice of
outside counsel, that  it is necessary to do so to avoid a breach of its
fiduciary duties under  applicable law, the Company may, in response to an
Acquisition Proposal which  was not solicited by it or which did not
otherwise result from a breach of  this  Section 7.9, and subject to the
Company\'s compliance with Section 7.9(d), (A)  furnish information with
respect to it and the Company Subsidiaries to any  Person pursuant to a
confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains  confidentiality and
standstill provisions that are no less favorable in the  aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement  (an
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"); provided that the Company shall 
promptly provide to the Parent any material non-public information
concerning  the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that is provided to any
such Person  which was not previously provided to the Parent or its
Representatives, and  (B)  participate in negotiations regarding such
Acquisition  Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in  Section 7.9(b) or this Section 7.9(c), prior to obtaining the Company 
Shareholders\' Approval, the Company shall be permitted to take the actions 
described in clauses (A) and (B) above with respect to any Excluded  Party.
From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, if the Company  has received an
Acquisition Proposal, promptly (and in any event within one  business day) it
shall advise Parent orally and in writing of such Acquisition  Proposal, any
request for information, and the material terms and conditions  of  such
request or Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Persons making 
such  request or Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep the Parent reasonably
informed  of the status and details (including material amendments) of any
such  Acquisition Proposal. Within one business day after the No-Shop 
Period Start Date, the Company shall notify the Parent of the names of the 
Excluded Parties, and shall provide a copy of any Acquisition Proposals made 
by  such Excluded Parties (or, where no such copy is available, a description
of  such Acquisition Proposal).

 

 

(d) Except  as  expressly permitted by this Section 7.9(d), neither the
Board of Directors  of  the Company, nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify, or propose  publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner
adverse to the Parent, the approval  or recommendation by such Board of
Directors or such committee thereof of the  Merger or the adoption and
approval of the matters to be considered at the  Company Meeting, (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve  or  recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (iii) cause or  permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, 
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement or understanding (an 
"Acquisition Agreement") related to any Acquisition  Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that there  exists a Superior
Proposal (as defined below), the Board of Directors of the  Company may,
prior to securing the Company Shareholders\' Approval, subject  to  this and
the following sentences of this Section 7.9(d), withdraw or modify  its 
approval or recommendation of the Merger or the approval of the matters to 
be  considered at the Company Meeting, and/or the Board of Directors of the
Company  may, prior to securing the Company Shareholders\' Approval (subject
to this  and  the following sentences of this Section 7.9(d)), approve or
recommend such  Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement (and, subject
to Article IX  hereof, concurrently with such termination, if it so chooses
to terminate,  the  Company shall enter into an Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Superior  Proposal), but only if (i) the Company is not in
material breach of the terms  of  this Agreement, (ii) the Company notifies
the Parent in writing that it intends  to enter into such an Acquisition
Agreement, attaching such Acquisition Proposal  to such notice, specifying
any material terms and conditions of such Acquisition  Agreement and
identifying the party making the Superior Proposal, (iii) with  respect to a
Superior Proposal made by an Excluded Party (but only if the Board  of
Directors seeks to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.9(d) 
after sixty (60) days following the date hereof), after taking into account 
any  revised offer made by the Parent within 24 hours of receipt of written 
notification from the Company of the Company\'s intention to enter into such 
Acquisition Agreement, such proposal does not cease to be a Superior
Proposal,  and (iv) with respect to a Superior Proposal made by a Person
other than an  Excluded Party, after taking into account any revised offer
made by the Parent  within five (5) business days of receipt of written
notification from the  Company of the Company\'s intention to enter into such
Acquisition Agreement,  such proposal does not cease to be a Superior
Proposal. With respect  to a Superior Proposal made by a Person other than an
Excluded Party, the  Company agrees (i) that it will not enter into a binding
Acquisition Agreement  referred to in clause (ii) above until at least the
sixth business day after  it  has provided the notice to the Parent required
hereby and (ii) to notify the  Parent promptly, if its intention to enter
into the written Acquisition  Agreement referred to in its notification shall
change at any time after giving  such notification. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Superior  Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal on terms that the  Board of Directors of the Company determines in
its good faith judgment (x)  (after receiving the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized  reputation) to be more favorable to the
Company\'s shareholders than the Merger  and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (y) constitutes a transaction  that  is reasonably likely to be
consummated on the terms proposed by the party making  the proposal, in each
case taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory  and other aspects
of the proposal; provided that for purposes of this definition  of "Superior
Proposal" the references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition  Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

 

 

(e) Nothing  in this Section 7.9 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the
Company from  taking and disclosing to the Company\'s shareholders a position
contemplated  by  Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation MA
promulgated under  the  Exchange Act, or other applicable law, if the Board
of Directors of the Company  determines, after consultation with outside
counsel, that failure to so disclose  such position could reasonably be
expected to constitute a violation of  applicable law and any such disclosure
which would otherwise constitute a  withdrawal, change or modification of the
approval or recommendation of the  Board of Directors of the Company, shall
not be deemed to constitute such a  withdrawal, change or modification with
respect to the Merger for the purposes  of Section 7.9(d) if the Board of
Directors of the Company expressly publicly  reaffirms its approval and
recommendation of the Merger within five (5) business  days after such
communication. In addition, it is understood and  agreed that, for purposes
of this Section 7.9, a factually accurate public  statement by the Company
that describes the Company\'s receipt of an Acquisition  Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto and contains  a  "stop-
look-and-listen communication" shall not constitute a withdrawal, change  or
modification of the approval or recommendation of the Board of Directors 
of  the Company with respect to the Merger for the purposes of Section 
7.9(d).

 

 

(f) After  the  No-Shop Period Start Date, other than with respect to an
Excluded Party, (i)  the  Company shall not, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries not to,  terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision
of, or grant permission under,  any standstill or confidentiality agreement
to which it or any of the Company  Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company
shall, and shall cause the Company  Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions
of any such agreement and (ii) the  Company shall not redeem the rights under
the Rights Agreement, amend the  expiration date of the Rights Agreement, or
amend the Rights Agreement in a  manner that would permit any Person other
than the Parent or the Merger Sub  or  their Affiliates or Associates (as
such terms are defined in the Rights  Agreement) to acquire 10% or more of
the shares of Company Common Stock without  becoming an "Acquiring Person" as
such term is defined in the Rights Agreement;  provided, however, that the
Company may permit a proposal to be made under  a  standstill agreement and
make such amendments to the Rights Agreement if it  determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that such  actions are necessary to
comply with the fiduciary duties of the Board of  Directors under applicable
law.

 

 

Section  7.10 _Post-Merger  Operations_.

 

 

(a) _Corporate  Offices_. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain its
operating  headquarters and the operating headquarters of Puget Sound Energy
in the  Bellevue, Washington area for a period of at least five years
following the  Merger (unless required to relocate such headquarters as a
result of a decision  issued by the WUTC).

 

 

(b) _Corporate  Contributions_. After the Effective Time and for a period of
five  years thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall, either through Puget
Sound  Energy Foundation or otherwise, provide corporate contributions and
community  support in the State of Washington at levels substantially
comparable to the  levels of charitable contributions and community support
provided by the Company  in such region as set forth in the Company\'s budget
for 2007. Upon  Closing, Parent will make a one-time contribution of $5
million to the Puget  Sound Energy Foundation.

 

 

(c) _Board  of Directors_. After the Effective Time, the board of directors
of  Puget Sound Energy and Parent shall each include the Chief Executive
Officer  of  Puget Sound Energy, and at least one Independent Director.
For  purposes of this Agreement, an "Independent Director" means a director
who  is  neither an officer of the Company or Parent, nor a designee,
stockholder,  affiliate or associates (within the meaning of the United
States federal  securities laws) of Parent or any of the members of Parent.
The  initial Independent Director shall be selected by the Parent, taking
into  consideration the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the
Company prior  to the Effective Time.

 

 

Section  7.11 _Expenses_. Subject  to Section 9.3, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this  Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party  incurring such expenses; provided,
however, that the expenses incurred for  experts, other than legal counsel,
retained for the purpose of advising and  supporting joint regulatory filings
shall be shared equally by the Company  and  the Parent.

 

 

Section  7.12 _Further  Assurances_. Each party will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to,  execute such further documents and instruments and take
such further actions  as  may reasonably be requested by any other party in
order to consummate the Merger  in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

 

Section  7.13 _Takeover  Statutes_. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share  acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation, including,  without limitation, Sections 23B.19.010 et. seq. of
the BCA (each, a "Takeover  Statute") is or may become applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Parent and the Company and its  Board  of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary  so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on  the  terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize  (to the greatest
extent practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute on  such
transactions.

 

 

Section  7.14 _Financing_.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Parent expressly  acknowledges and agrees that the Parent\'s and the
Merger Sub\'s obligations  hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon
the Parent or the Merger Sub  obtaining any financing. The Parent shall keep
the Company apprised  of all material developments or changes relating to the
Financing Commitments  and the Financing contemplated thereby. The failure,
for any reason,  of the Parent and the Merger Sub to have sufficient cash
available on the  Closing Date to pay the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Article II  hereof and/or the failure to so pay the Merger Consideration
on the Closing  Date  shall constitute a willful and material breach of this
Agreement. In  addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the existence of any
conditions contained  in the Financing Commitments or the Financing
(including the Commitment  Agreement) shall not constitute, nor be construed
to constitute, a condition  to  the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

(b) The  Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken,  all  actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper  or advisable to arrange, and close upon concurrently with
the Closing, the  Debt  Financing on the terms and conditions described in
or comparable to the Debt  Financing Commitment (provided that the Parent may
terminate and replace or  amend the Debt Financing Commitment with a New Debt
Financing Commitment or  to  add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities  who had not executed the Debt
Financing Commitment as of the date hereof so  long  as the addition of such
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents  or similar entities
does not otherwise prevent or delay the Closing or otherwise  materially
impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder) 
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Debt  Financing Commitment, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable  to the Parent or the Merger Sub to obtaining the Debt Financing,
(iii) enter  into definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and
conditions  contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or any New Debt
Financing  Commitments or on other terms that would not adversely impact the
ability of  the  Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iv)  consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing. If
any portion  of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions  contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, the Parent shall
use its  reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing
from  alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transaction  contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
following the  occurrence of such event. The Parent shall give the Company
prompt  notice of any material breach of the Debt Financing Commitment of
which the  Parent becomes aware or any termination of the Debt Financing 
Commitment. The Parent shall keep the Company informed on a  reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of the efforts  to  arrange
the Debt Financing and provide copies of all documents related to the  Debt
Financing (other than any ancillary documents subject to confidentiality 
agreements) to the Company.

 

 

(c) The  Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken,  all  actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or  advisable to arrange, and close upon concurrently with the
Closing, the Investor  Financing on the terms and conditions described in or
comparable to the  Commitment Agreement (provided that the Parent may,
subject to the terms of  the  Commitment Agreement, terminate and replace or
amend the Commitment Agreement  to  add investors who had not executed the
Commitment Agreement as of the date  hereof or otherwise so long as the terms
would not adversely impact the ability  of the Parent to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement  or  otherwise prevent or
materially delay or materially impair the consummation  of  the transactions
contemplated hereby) including using its reasonable best  efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Commitment Agreement, (ii) satisfy on  a  timely
basis all conditions applicable to the Parent or the Merger Sub to  obtaining
the Investor Financing, (iii) enter into definitive agreements with  respect
thereto on terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Agreement  or
any replacement commitments or on other terms that would not prevent or 
materially delay the Closing or adversely impact the ability of the Parent 
to  consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv)
consummate  the Investor Financing at or prior to Closing. If any portion of
the  Investor Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated  in the Commitment Agreement, the Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts  to  arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources in an amount  sufficient to consummate the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as  promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event. The  Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of
any material breach of the  Commitment Agreement of which the Parent becomes
aware or any termination of  the  Commitment Agreement. The Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a  reasonably current basis in reasonable detail
of the status of the efforts  to  arrange the Investor Financing and provide

ancillary documents subject to  confidentiality agreements) to the Company.

 

 

(d) The  Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, at the
Parent\'s  sole  expense (and provided that such requested cooperation does
not unreasonably  interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and
the Subsidiaries or  require the Company to agree to pay any fees, reimburse
any expenses or give  any  indemnities prior to the Effective Time for which
it is not reimbursed or  indemnified under this Agreement) use its and their
reasonable best efforts  to  provide such cooperation as may be reasonably
requested by the Parent in  connection with the Financings, including using
reasonable best efforts to  (i)  cause appropriate officers and employees to
be available, on a customary basis  and upon reasonable notice, to meet
(including in Australia) with ratings  agencies and prospective lenders and
investors in presentations, meetings,  and  due diligence sessions, (ii)
assist with the preparation of disclosure documents  and other information
reasonably requested by the Parent in connection  therewith, (iii) provide
financing sources with reasonable access to the  properties, books and
records of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, execute  and deliver any
customary pledge or security documents or other customary  definitive
financing documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested  by the
Parent, (iv) assist the Parent with the syndication efforts for the  Debt 
Financing, and (v) direct its independent accountants and counsel to provide 
customary and reasonable assistance to the Parent.

 

 

Section  7.15 _Rate  Cases, Etc_. The Parent and the Merger Sub (x)
acknowledge that  the Puget Sound Energy, intends to initiate the 2007 WUTC
Rate Case, and (y)  agree that any effects relating to or resulting from the
foregoing (including  any filings made or proceedings brought by third
parties in response to or  in  connection with the foregoing) shall neither
result in a Company Material  Adverse Effect nor otherwise affect the
obligations of the Parent and the Merger  Sub to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

Section  7.16 _Transfer  Taxes_. The Parent, the Merger Sub, the Company and
the Surviving  Corporation shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all  Tax  Returns, documents, affidavits and other filings
relating to any stock transfer,  state and local real estate transfer, state
and local real estate excise, sales,  use, documentary, stamp, recording and
other similar Taxes (including interest,  penalties and additions to any such
Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in  connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including,  if  applicable, supplying in a
timely manner a complete list of all real property  interests held by the
Company that are located in Washington State and any  information with
respect to such property that is reasonably necessary to  complete such
filings. Such Transfer Tax shall be paid by the Company  or the Surviving
Corporation without deduction or withholding of any amount  from  the Merger
Consideration required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement with  respect to
the Company Common Stock and none of Parent, the Merger Sub, the  Company or
the Surviving Corporation shall take any actions or submit any  filings that
are inconsistent with or contrary to this provision. The  Parent, the Merger
Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take  all  reasonable
actions to minimize the amount of any such Transfer  Taxes.

 

 

Section  7.17 _Certain  Credit Facilities_. Each of the Company, the Parent
and the Merger  Sub agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts
to terminate the  Company\'s credit agreements set forth on Section 7.17 of
the Company Disclosure  Letter (the "Designated Credit Agreements") and in
connection therewith, obtain  the release of all Liens under the Designated
Credit Agreements, and obtain  the  release of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries from all material  liabilities and obligations under the
Designated Credit Agreements and any  related guarantees (other than
obligations under any indemnification or similar  provision that survives
termination).

 

 

Section  7.18 _Transition  Committee._ As promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, the  Parent and the Company shall establish a transition
committee (the "Transition  Committee") consisting of two (2) representatives
designated by each of the  Company and the Parent. The activities of the
Transition Committee  shall include the development of regulatory plans and
proposals, the  facilitation of the transfer of information between the
parties and other  matters as the Transition Committee deems appropriate. At
all times  after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time (or the
earlier  termination of this Agreement), there shall be one representative of
the Parent  on the Transition Committee that shall be designated by the
Parent as the  primary contact person for the Company at the Parent (the
"Parent  Contact"). In the event that the Company elects to request that
the  Parent consent to any action or matter involving the Company or any of
the  Company Subsidiaries as is contemplated by Section 6.1(B)(v), the
Company shall  make all such requests to the Parent Contact, and the Parent
agrees that it  will  use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent
Contact to respond as  promptly as practicable to any such request, taking
into account the nature  of  the request, the circumstances under which the
request is made and the timing  indicated in the request. The Parent Contact
shall initially be Chris  Leslie, and may be changed by the Parent from time
to time by written notice  from the Parent to the Company.

warranties that expressly  speak  only as of a specific date or time which
only need to be true and correct as  of  such date or time). All other
representations and warranties of the  Company set forth in this Agreement

(g) _Statutory  Approvals_. The Company Required Statutory Approvals shall
have been obtained  and shall have become Final Orders, and such Final Orders
shall not,  individually or in the aggregate, (i) impose terms, conditions,
liabilities,  obligations, commitments or sanctions upon the Company or any

mean a material adverse effect on the  business, assets, liabilities,
properties, financial condition or results of  operations of an entity
otherwise identical to the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries, taken as a

Parent  or any of their respective affiliates imposed by a Final Order shall
be  considered in the determination as to whether a Final Order would
reasonably  be  expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect for
purposes of this Section  8.2(g), as if such adverse effect had been imposed
on the Company; or (ii)  impose any term, condition, liability, obligation,
commitment or sanction on  any  member of Parent or any of their respective

Energy has been duly incorporated  and is a validly existing corporation

qualification, except where the failure so to qualify  or  to be in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably  be expected
to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii) the Company  has all
corporate power and authority necessary to execute, deliver and perform  its
obligations under this Agreement; (iv) this Agreement has been duly 
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid

imposition of any Lien upon any property or  assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under, any indenture, mortgage,  deed of trust, loan
agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the  Company and/or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company and/or  any of its
Subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets  of  the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries is subject and, in each case, that 
is  filed as an exhibit to the Company\'s most recent Annual Report on Form
10-K  at  the time of Closing (except for such defaults, breaches, Liens
that,  individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have  a  Company Material Adverse Effect), or (y) violate any Washington
State or Federal  statute or any order, rule or regulation of any Washington
State or Federal  court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction
over the Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties or
assets that, in each case,  in  the experience of such counsel, is normally

repayment of the aggregate  principal amount outstanding under such credit
agreements, together with all  interest accrued thereon and any other fees or
expenses payable thereunder,  (i)  such credit agreements shall be
terminated, (ii) any and all Liens under such  credit agreements related
thereto shall be released and (iii) the Company and  the Company Subsidiaries
shall be released from any and all material liabilities  and obligations
under such credit agreements and any related guaranties (other  than any
obligations under any indemnification or similar provision that  survives
such termination); provided that the Parent shall not be entitled  to  rely
on the condition set forth in this Section 8.2(j) if the failure of such 
condition to be satisfied results from the failure of the Parent and the
Merger  Sub to have sufficient funds to fulfill their obligations hereunder
at the  time  of the Closing.

Merger_. The obligation  of the Company to effect the Merger shall be further

shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amounts  paid pursuant to this
Section 9.3(b)(i).

obligations pursuant  to  Article II hereof, and (ii) at the time of such
termination there is no state  of  facts or circumstances (other than a
state of facts or circumstances caused  by a  breach of the Parent\'s or
Merger Sub\'s representations and warranties or  covenants or agreements
hereunder) that would cause the conditions set forth  in  Sections 8.1 and
8.2 not to be satisfied or capable of satisfaction (and a  condition shall be
deemed to be not capable of satisfaction, to the extent  such  condition has
not been or could not be satisfied on or prior to the date of  termination of

agreement hereof, if such breach is either (x) not curable or (y)  if 
curable, is not cured within thirty (30) days after the earlier of (1)
receipt  by the Company of notice of such breach in writing from the Parent
or (2) the  date of termination of this Agreement) on or prior to the date of

Interruption  Fee") to the Company. Contemporaneously with such termination,

entitled  to  immediately withdraw from the Escrow Account (the "Escrow
Account" ) established  pursuant to the Escrow Agreement dated of even date
herewith by and among the  Company, the Parent and The Bank of New York, as
Escrow Agent, an amount equal  to the Business Interruption Fee, in payment
thereof.

 

 

(d) _Nature  of Fees_. The parties agree that the agreements contained in
this  Section 9.3 are an integral part of the Merger and the other
transactions  contemplated hereby and constitute liquidated damages and not
a  penalty. Subject to Section 10.12, the parties further agree that if  one
party is or becomes obligated to pay a termination fee or Business 
Interruption Fee pursuant to Section 9.3(a) or 9.3(c), respectively, as the 
case  may be, the right to receive such termination fee or Business
Interruption  Fee  (and, in the case of the Parent, together with the right
to receive payment  of  expenses pursuant to Section 9.3(b)), as applicable,
shall be the sole and  exclusive remedy of the other party with respect to
the facts and circumstances  giving rise to such payment obligation under
this Agreement or otherwise at  law  or in equity. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in  this Section 9.3, if one party fails to
promptly pay to the other any fee or  expense due under Section 9.3(a), (b)
or (c), in addition to any amounts paid  or  payable pursuant to such
sections, the defaulting party shall pay the costs  and  expenses (including
legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action,  including the filing
of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect  payment, together
with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee from the date  such fee was
required to be paid at the prime rate as reported in the Wall  Street Journal
on the date such fee was required to be paid.

 

 

(e) _Maximum  Recovery_. In no event shall the liability of the Parent and
the  Merger Sub arising out of or relating to any breaches of this Agreement
exceed  an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the Business
Interruption  Fee.

 

 

(f) _No  Recourse_. Each of the Company, the Parent and the Merger Sub 
acknowledges and agrees that, other than pursuant to any agreement to which 
such  Person is a party, it has no right of recovery against, and no
liability shall  attach to, the former, current or future stockholders,
directors, officers,  employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers,
general or limited partners  or  assignees of the Company, the Parent or the
Merger Sub or any former, current  or  future stockholder, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner,  member, manager, affiliate,
agent or assignee of any of the foregoing, whether  by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, partnership or limited  liability company veil, by
or through a claim by or on behalf of the Company,  the Parent or the Merger
Sub against an affiliate, arising under, or in  connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or  otherwise relating
thereto, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any  legal  or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable  law,  or
otherwise.

 

 

Section  9.4 _Amendment_. This  Agreement may be amended by the Boards of
Directors or the Board of Managers,  as  applicable, of the parties hereto
at any time before or after the Company  Shareholders\' Approval and prior to
the Effective Time; provided, however,  that  after the Company
Shareholders\' Approval is obtained, no such amendment which  under
applicable law would require the further approval of the Company\'s 
shareholders shall be made without obtaining such approval. This  Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf  of
each of the parties hereto.

 

 

Section  9.5 _Waiver_. At  any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may (a) extend the  time  for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties  hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties  contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive  compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein, to the  extent permitted by
applicable law. Any agreement on the part of a  party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth  in  an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure  of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement  or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section  10.3 _Entire  Agreement_. This Agreement and the Stock Purchase
Agreement are  being entered into simultaneously but are separate 
transactions. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the 
provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement are not intended to, and in no
way,  modify or supplement the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement 
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) together with 
the  Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all  other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, between the  parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

 

Section  10.4 _Severability_. Any  term or provision of this Agreement that
is held by a court of competent  jurisdiction or other authority to be
invalid, void or unenforceable in any  situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability  of  the remaining terms and
provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability  of  the offending term
or provision in any other situation or in any other  jurisdiction. If the
final judgment of a court of competent  jurisdiction or other authority
declares that any term or provision hereof  is  invalid, void or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making such  determination
shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area or  applicability of
the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,  or  to replace
any invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision with a term  or 
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing 
the  intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 

 

Section  10.5 _Interpretation_. When  a reference is made in this Agreement
to Sections or Exhibits, such reference  shall be to a Section or Exhibit of
this Agreement, respectively, unless  otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in  this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any  way  the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words  "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall  be  deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation," if they are not already  followed by such words.

 

 

Section  10.6 _Counterparts;  Effect_. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile and in one or  more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to
be an original, but all  of  which together shall constitute one and the
same agreement.

 

 

Section  10.7 _No  Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon  and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and,
except for (a) rights  of Indemnified Parties as set forth in Section 7.5,
and (b) the right of the  Company, on behalf of its shareholders, to pursue
damages in the event of the  Parent\'s or the Merger Sub\'s willful or
knowing breach of this Agreement, which  damages, together with any other
amounts paid hereunder, shall be limited in  amount as provided in Section
9.3, nothing in this Agreement, express or  implied, is intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies  of  any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

 

Section  10.8 _Governing  Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in  accordance with the laws of the State of Washington without
giving effect to  the  principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 

 

Section  10.9 _Venue_. Each  of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction  of any federal or state court located in
and for Seattle, Washington in the  event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it shall not  attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request  for leave from any such
court and (c) agrees that it shall not bring any action  relating to this
Agreement in any court other than a federal or state court  sitting in and
for Seattle, Washington.

 

 

Section  10.10 _Waiver  of Jury Trial and Certain Damages_. EACH PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT  WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
(A) ANY RIGHT IT  MAY  HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING ARISING  OUT  OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND (B)
WITHOUT LIMITATION TO SECTION 9.3,  ANY  RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO RECEIVE
DAMAGES FROM ANY OTHER PARTY BASED ON ANY THEORY  OF  LIABILITY FOR ANY
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS)  OR  PUNITIVE
DAMAGES.

 

 

Section  10.11 _Assignment_. Neither  this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall  be assigned by any party hereto
(whether by operation of law or otherwise)  without the prior written consent
of the other party; _provided_ that,  without the consent of the Company, the
Parent may transfer or assign (including  by way of a pledge), in whole or
from time to time in part, all of its rights  and obligations under this
Agreement to one or more of its affiliates or to  its lenders or other
financing sources as collateral security so long as such  transfer or
assignment would not constitute a Contrary Action; _provided_   that no such
transfer or assignment will relieve the Parent of its obligations  hereunder.
Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this  Agreement to the
Parent shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context  otherwise
requires.

 

 

Section  10.12 _Specific  Enforcement; Certain Remedies_.

 

 

(a) The  parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision
of this  Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with the
terms hereof  and that, prior to the termination of this Agreement, the
Parent and the Merger  Sub shall be entitled to specific performance of the
terms  hereof. The parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be 
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement  by the Parent or the Merger Sub or to otherwise enforce
specifically the terms  and provisions of this Agreement, _provided_ that the
Company shall be  entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement  by the Parent or the Merger Sub that would cause
irreparable harm, and to  enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement solely with  respect to clause (v) to the lead-in to Section
6.1, the last sentence of  Section 7.1, Section 7.3, Section 7.6 and Section
7.14; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in no event shall the Company be
entitled to any injunction  or specific enforcement of the terms of this
Agreement requiring the Parent  or  the Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
or prohibiting the Parent or the Merger  Sub from failing to consummate the
Merger.

 

 

(b) The  parties agree that any Contrary Action that would result in a Parent
Majority  Group holding 20% or more of the equity interests in a Person
proposing to  acquire any regulated electric or gas distribution company in
Washington State  shall constitute a willful and material breach of this
Agreement by the Parent,  and that the Parent and the Merger Sub shall be
liable for liabilities and  damages resulting therefrom, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section  9.3. For purposes of this Section 10.12(b),
"Parent Majority Group"  shall mean any group of the direct or indirect
equity investors in Parent  (together with their affiliates, which in the
case of any subsidiaries shall  only refer to those entities of which such
equity investor has Control),  directly or indirectly, holding 20% or more of
the equity interests in the  Parent and "Control" shall mean the possession,
direct or indirect, of the  power  to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of a Person,  whether through the ownership of
securities, by contract or  otherwise.

 

 

Section  10.13 _Obligations  of the Parent and of the Company_. Whenever
this Agreement  requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirement shall  be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such  Subsidiary to take such action and, after the
Effective Time, on the part of  the  Surviving Corporation to cause such
Subsidiary to take such  action. Whenever this Agreement requires the Merger
Sub to take any  action, such requirements shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the  part  of the Parent to cause the Merger Sub to take such
action.
