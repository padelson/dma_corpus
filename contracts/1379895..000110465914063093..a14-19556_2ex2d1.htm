Buyers proposed Purchase Price Allocation Schedule within the thirty (30)
Business Day period described above, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in good
faith to mutually agree upon a Purchase Price Allocation Schedule as soon as
practicable. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to reach a resolution within a
period of twenty (20) Business Days following receipt of Sellers changes,
then only the remaining disputed items shall be submitted for resolution by a
nationally-recognized public accounting firm that is independent with respect
to each of the Parties (within the meaning of Rule 2-01 under Securities and
Exchange Commission Regulation S-X) or, if that firm declines to act as
provided in this _Section 2.7(a)_, another firm of independent public
accountants mutually acceptable to Buyer and Sellers, which firm shall make a
final determination as to the disputed items within thirty (30) Business Days
after such submission, and such determination, together with the undisputed
items, shall be final, binding and conclusive on Sellers and Buyer. The fees
and disbursements of such accounting firm shall be shared equally between
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand.

 



 

(b) Sellers and Buyer each shall prepare an IRS Form 8594, "Asset Acquisition
Statement Under Section 1060," consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule mutually agreed upon pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_, which the Parties
shall use to report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the
applicable Taxing Authorities. Each Seller and Buyer shall provide the other
promptly with any other information required to complete Form 8594. The
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall be revised to take into account
subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, including any indemnification
payments (which shall be treated for Tax purposes as adjustments to the
Purchase Price), in accordance with the provisions of Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. For all Tax purposes, the Parties
agree that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be reported
in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, and none of the Parties shall take any
position inconsistent therewith on any Tax return, refund claim, litigation or
otherwise, unless required to do so by Law or a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code.

Retail," "DER," "DERS," "Duke Energy Commercial Enterprises" and any word or

cause each Acquired Company and their Affiliates not to (and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Coal Project Co-Owner and each
Coal Participant Project Operator not to), use the Sellers Marks or any
patents or other Intellectual Property rights belonging to any Seller or its
respective Non-Company Affiliates that have not been expressly conveyed to
Buyer or an Acquired Company, and Buyer acknowledges that it, its Affiliates,
the Acquired Companies, the Projects, the Coal Project Co-Owners and the Coal

Retail Company in the ordinary course of business substantially as conducted
by the Retail Company immediately prior to the Closing Date pursuant to and as
further set forth in the Transition License Agreement (the " ** _Transition
License_** "). The Transition License shall automatically and immediately
terminate upon the expiration of the License Period, and if Buyer or the

Retail Company not to, use any other logos, trademarks, service marks,
designations, trade names or corporate names in combination or in connection
with the Licensed Mark during the License Period, except as may be approved in
writing by Parent in its sole discretion.

 



 

(c) During the License Period, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Retail Company
to, make clear in all correspondence, communications or other dissemination of
information that include the Licensed Mark made by Buyer, the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates that the Business and the
Acquired Companies are no longer affiliated with any of Sellers or the Non-
Company Affiliates, in a form and manner approved in writing by Retail Seller.

 



 

(d) In connection with any use of the Sellers Marks by Buyer or the Acquired
Companies to the extent expressly permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.4_,
Buyer shall and shall cause each Acquired Company (and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each Coal Project Co-Owner and each Coal
Participant Project Operator) to comply with, in all respects, all of Sellers
and their Non-Company Affiliates quality control requirements, policies and
guidelines in effect at such time and as may be provided to Buyer or any
Acquired Company by Sellers from time to time during the use of the Sellers
Marks in accordance with this _Section 6.4_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
including this _Section 6.4_, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Closing, but in any event within three (3) Business Days after the
Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, cease using
any name that includes any of the names, logos, trademarks, trade names,
patents or other Intellectual Property set forth on _Schedule 6.4(e)_ (the "
** _Specified Marks_** ") or any similar words that would raise a reasonable
likelihood of confusion with the Specified Marks, and Buyer acknowledges that
from and after the Closing it, its Affiliates, the Acquired Companies, the
Projects, the Coal Project Co-Owners and the Coal Participant Project
Operators have no rights whatsoever to use the Specified Marks.

 



 

 **6.5.** ** ****_Support Obligations_**.

 



 

(a) Buyer recognizes that certain of the Non-Company Affiliates have provided
credit support on behalf of certain of the Acquired Companies with respect to
the operation of their respective Businesses, to the Coal Participant Project
Operators with respect to the Coal Participant Projects and otherwise pursuant
to certain credit support obligations, including guarantees, letters of
credit, escrow arrangements, surety and performance bonds and security
agreements and arrangements (other than collateral included in Net Working
Capital), all of which that are outstanding as of the date hereof are set
forth on _Schedule 6.5(a)_ (the " ** _Support Obligations_**").

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
effect the full and unconditional release, effective as of the Closing Date,
of the Non-Company Affiliates from all Support Obligations ( _provided_ that
with respect to any Support Obligations posted or maintained in connection
with an Affiliate Dedicated Contract, the terms of this _Section 6.5_ shall
apply only to such Support Obligations posted or maintained in connection with
those Affiliate Dedicated Contracts that become Assigned Contracts), including
by:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) providing a Buyer guaranty to replace each existing guaranty that is a
Support Obligation containing terms equal to or more favorable to the
beneficiary thereof than the terms of such existing guaranty (other than with
respect to the credit rating of the guarantor); _provided_ that if the
beneficiary of any existing guaranty does not accept such a replacement
guaranty (effective as of the Closing) by the date that is forty-five (45)
days after the date hereof (A) and the terms of such existing guaranty or of
any Contract or Law requiring such existing guaranty to be maintained permit
the replacement of such existing guaranty with another form of credit support,
Buyer shall offer the beneficiary of such existing guaranty such other form of
credit support in order to obtain the release of such existing guaranty or (B)
if the terms of such existing guaranty or of any such Contract or Law
requiring such existing guaranty to be maintained do not so permit the
replacement of such existing guaranty, Buyer shall offer to replace such
existing guaranty with a Letter of Credit or cash in an amount up to the
amount of such existing guaranty in substitution therefor;

 



 

(ii) furnishing a Letter of Credit to replace each existing letter of credit
that is a Support Obligation containing terms and conditions that are
substantially identical to the terms and conditions of such existing letter of
credit;

 



 

(iii) instituting an escrow arrangement to replace each existing escrow
arrangement that is a Support Obligation with terms equal to or more favorable
to the counterparty thereunder than the terms of such existing escrow
arrangement;

 



 

(iv) posting a surety or performance bond to replace each existing surety or
performance bond that is a Support Obligation issued by a Person having a net
worth and Credit Rating at least equal to those of the issuer of such existing
surety or performance bond, and containing terms and conditions that are
substantially identical to the terms and conditions of such existing surety or
performance bond; and

 



 

(v) replacing any other security agreement or arrangement on substantially
identical terms and conditions to the existing security agreement or
arrangement that is a Support Obligation.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the beneficiary
or beneficiaries of the Support Obligations to (i) remit any cash to Sellers
or their respective Non-Company Affiliates, as applicable, held under any
escrow arrangement that is a Support Obligation promptly following the
replacement of such escrow arrangement pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)(iii)_
(unless such cash has been reflected in Net Working Capital as being
transferred with the Acquired Companies at Closing) and (ii) terminate and
redeliver to Sellers or their respective Affiliates each original copy of each
original guaranty, letter of credit or other instrument constituting or
evidencing such Support Obligations; _provided_ that for purposes of clarity,
Buyers obligations to provide replacement credit support are limited
exclusively to those items listed on _Schedule 6.5(a)_ , as amended or
supplemented pursuant to _Section 6.5(g)_.

 



 

(d) If Buyer is not successful, following the use of commercially reasonable
efforts, in obtaining the complete and unconditional release of the Non-
Company Affiliates from any Support Obligations effective as of the Closing
(each such Support Obligation, until such time as such Support Obligation is
released in accordance with _Section 6.5(d)(i)_, a " ** _Continuing Support
Obligation_** "), then:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) from and after the Closing, Buyer shall continue to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain promptly the full and unconditional release of
the Non-Company Affiliates from each Continuing Support Obligation;

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall indemnify each Seller and each Non-Company Affiliate for any
Losses incurred by each Seller and each Non-Company Affiliate in connection
with each Continuing Support Obligation;

 



 

(iii) Buyer shall not, shall cause each Acquired Company not to and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Coal Participant Project
Operator not to, effect any amendments or modifications or any other changes
to the Contracts or obligations to which any of the Continuing Support
Obligations relate, or to otherwise take any action, in each case that
increases, extends or accelerates the liability of the Non-Company Affiliates
under any Continuing Support Obligation, without Sellers prior written
consent; and

 



 

(iv) Buyer shall deliver to Sellers at the Closing and maintain at all times
until the full and unconditional release of each Continuing Support Obligation
in accordance with _Section 6.5(d)(i)_ either:

 



 

(A) a Letter of Credit in an amount equal to maximum amount as set forth under
"Subject Amount" on _Schedule 6.5(a)_ for all Continuing Support Obligations
in the aggregate (and the full amount of such Letter of Credit shall be
available for drawing with respect to any one or more of the Continuing
Support Obligations), which amount shall be reduced from time to time by the
amount of any Continuing Support Obligations from which Sellers are
subsequently released; _provided_ that, if at any time the issuer of the
Letter of Credit fails to meet the Minimum Issuer Requirements, then within
five (5) Business Days of the earlier of (1) Sellers request and (2) Buyers
knowledge of such failure, Buyer shall replace the Letter of Credit with a
Letter of Credit from an issuer that meets the Minimum Issuer Requirements;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if Buyer elects to fulfill its obligations
under this _Section 6.5(d)(iv)_ through the provision of a Letter of Credit
pursuant to this clause (A), then on the last Business Day of each three (3)
month period following the Closing Date until such time as no Continuing
Support Obligations remain outstanding, Buyer shall pay Sellers or their
designee a fee in respect of each Continuing Support Obligation, with such fee
determined in accordance with _Section 6.5(d)(iv)(C)_ below; or

 



 

(B) an unlimited guaranty of Buyers obligations hereunder with respect to the
Continuing Support Obligations from a Person with a Credit Rating of
Investment Grade, which guarantee shall be in form and substance satisfactory
to each Seller in its sole discretion; _provided_ that, if Buyers guarantor
fails to maintain a Credit Rating of Investment Grade at any time, then Buyer
shall provide a Letter of Credit pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)(iv)(A)_ within

 



       
 

 



 

five (5) Business Days of the earlier of (1) Sellers request and (2) Buyers
knowledge of such failure; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if Buyer elects to
fulfill its obligations under this _Section 6.5(d)(iv)_ through the provision
of a guaranty pursuant to this clause (B), then on the last Business Day of
each three (3) month period following the Closing Date until such time as no
Continuing Support Obligations remain outstanding, Buyer shall pay Sellers or
their designee a fee in respect of each Continuing Support Obligation, with
such fee determined in accordance with _Section 6.5(d)(iv)(C)_ below.

 



 

(C) The fee payable by Buyer pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) of _Sections
6.5(d)(iv)_ shall be determined as follows: On the last Business Day of the
first three (3) month period following the Closing Date, the fee shall be
calculated at a rate of one and one-quarter percent (1.25%) (on a per annum
basis) on the amount under the heading "Subject Amount" on _Schedule 6.5(a)_
with respect to each Continuing Support Obligation remaining outstanding as of
such date, and the rate of such fee shall increase by an additional one-half
percent (0.5%) (on a per annum basis) on the last Business Day of each
subsequent three (3) month period after such initial three (3) month period
after the Closing Date with respect to any such Continuing Support Obligation
that remains outstanding, up to a maximum rate of three and one-quarter
percent (3.25%) (on a per annum basis); _provided_ that, if any Continuing
Support Obligations continue to remain outstanding, then on each twelve (12)
month anniversary of the Closing Date, the maximum rate for calculating such
fee shall increase over the maximum rate applicable to the immediately
preceding twelve (12) month period by the increase in LIBOR over such twelve
(12) month period, if any (but for the avoidance of doubt, any decrease in
LIBOR shall not affect such maximum rate); _provided further_ , that if the
rate for calculating any fee payable under this _Section 6.5(d)_ would exceed
the highest rate permitted under applicable Law, then, _ipso facto_ , the rate
shall be automatically reduced to the maximum lawful rate.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Seller
and each Non-Company Affiliate may not terminate any Continuing Support
Obligations at any time after the Closing Date until such Continuing Support
Obligations terminate or expire by their terms or by consent of the applicable
beneficiary or are replaced pursuant to this _Section 6.5_.

 



 

(f) During the Interim Period, Buyer shall have the right to contact and have
discussions with each beneficiary of a Support Obligation in order to satisfy
its obligations under this _Section 6.5_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
shall give Sellers prior notice before making any such contact.

 



 

(g) Any and all new or replacement credit support obligations or any
modification or increase in the existing credit support obligations entered
into or executed by any Seller or Non-Company Affiliate with respect to any
Acquired Company and/or under the Co-Owner Agreements with respect to the
Projects during the Interim Period shall constitute Support Obligations
hereunder, and all of Buyers obligations under this _Section 6.5_ shall
apply with respect thereto; _provided_ that Sellers shall consult with Buyer
prior to any Seller or Non-

 



      
 

 



 

Company Affiliate entering into or executing any new credit support obligation
if as a result of such new credit support obligation, the aggregate
outstanding amount of Support Obligations as of the Closing would be increased
by more than $50,000,000 as compared to the outstanding amount of Support
Obligations as of the date hereof. Sellers shall have the continuing
obligation until the Closing to supplement or amend promptly _Schedule 6.5(a)_
with respect to any additional Support Obligations entered into during the
Interim Period, which, if existing at the date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth _Schedule 6.5(a)_ , and to provide such
supplements or amendments to Buyer on a regular basis.

 



 

 **6.6.** ** ****_Excluded Items; Post-Closing Payments on Purchased
Assets_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and
Sellers agree that the Purchased Assets shall exclude those items listed on
_Schedule 6.6_ (collectively, the " ** _Excluded Items_** "), Sellers or their
Non-Company Affiliates shall retain all benefits and liabilities with respect
to the Excluded Items and Sellers shall, prior to the Closing Date, use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Acquired Companies to distribute,
transfer or assign each Excluded Item to a Seller or a Non-Company Affiliate
or to terminate such Excluded Item with no post-Closing liability on an
Acquired Company. Buyer acknowledges that the inability of Sellers to have any
Excluded Item distributed, transferred or assigned from any Acquired Company
or terminated for any reason shall not delay the Closing and any Excluded Item
that Sellers are unable to so distribute, transfer, assign or terminate by the
Closing shall be referred to as a " ** _Non-Transferred Excluded Item_**."
After the Closing Date with respect to each Non-Transferred Excluded Item,
Buyer shall permit Sellers to exclusively direct and manage each Acquired
Companys participation in all negotiations, Claims or other proceedings
involving such Non-Transferred Excluded Item, whether existing on the Closing
Date or arising thereafter. Buyer shall also permit Sellers to settle or
compromise on behalf of any Acquired Company any Non-Transferred Excluded Item
in Sellers sole discretion (except that Buyers consent shall be required if
such settlement or compromise would adversely affect Buyer in any material
respect), and shall promptly pay Sellers any proceeds or recoveries received
in connection with any Non-Transferred Excluded Item. Buyer shall, at Sellers
expense: (a) cause any Person under its control with knowledge of relevant
facts pertaining to any Non-Transferred Excluded Item to provide assistance to
Sellers as reasonably requested by any Seller; and (b) provide any relevant
books, records or other information of any Acquired Company to Sellers and
access to each Operator Project site (and use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide access to each Coal Participant Project site), as reasonably
requested by any Seller, in connection with any Non-Transferred Excluded Item;
_provided_ that in no event shall Buyer or any Acquired Company be obligated
to take or to cause any Person to take or permit Sellers to take any action
pursuant to this _Section 6.6(a)_ that would (A) violate any applicable Law
or (B) unreasonably interfere with the business of Buyer or any of the
Acquired Companies. Sellers shall remain at all times responsible for all
credit support obligations with respect to all Excluded Items.

 



 

(b) If the consent or approval of any third party is required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the assignment or
transfer of any Purchased Asset that is a Contract or Permit to Buyer, but is
not obtained prior to the Closing, Sellers shall continue to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent after the Closing, and
Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer in any lawful and economically feasible
arrangement

 



      
 

 



 

(including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide that Buyer

during such year, prior to the Closing and have been processed and paid by the
earlier of the end of (i) the calendar year in which the Closing occurs or

Employee shall be responsible for providing the necessary information to Buyer
based upon benefit forms received by the Continuing Non-Unionized Employee
from the medical plan maintained by Sellers or their respective Affiliates;

 



 

(vi) provide full service credit for all purposes (other than to the extent

benefit accrual purposes under any pension plan) under all vacation,

made available to Continuing Non-Unionized Employees by Buyer, the Acquired

Seller or any of their respective Affiliates to whom Buyer or its
Representatives had been directly or indirectly introduced or otherwise had
first contact with as a result of its consideration of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that this clause (ii) shall not

Sellers make a determination pursuant to Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h)(4)
for such Continuing Non-Unionized Employees to be treated as not separating
from service with Sellers and their Affiliates, for purposes of Section 409A
of the Code, until they terminate employment with Buyer and its Affiliates, in
which case Buyer hereby agrees that it shall (i) acknowledge and agree in

terminated, effective upon or before the Closing, all Affiliate Contracts
other than the Affiliate Contracts set forth on _Schedule 6.8(a)_ (the " **
_Continued Affiliate Contracts_** ") and (ii) cause all Claims, accounts or
obligations (contingent or otherwise) between any Acquired Company, on the one
hand, and any Seller or any Non-Company Affiliate, on the other hand, to be
settled, released or otherwise eliminated, in such a manner as Sellers shall
determine, effective immediately prior to the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, Claims, accounts or obligations solely between and among any of the

(b) _Affiliate Dedicated Contracts_.

 



 

(i) From and after the date hereof, Buyer and Sellers shall use their

assumption of such Affiliate Dedicated Contract by each Assignor to each
Assignee identified on _Schedule 1.1-AD_ and the related release of the
Assignor thereunder, as

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by the Assignment and Assumption Agreements to occur at the
Closing; _provided_ that any obligation to seek such consent by Buyer and
Sellers shall terminate as of the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing,
Buyers efforts shall include offering to replace any credit support posted or
maintained by a Seller or a Non-Company Affiliate in favor of any Counterparty
to any Affiliate Dedicated Contract in accordance with the requirements of
_Section 6.5_, and in the case of Affiliate Dedicated Contracts with respect
to which none of Sellers or the Non-Company Affiliates has posted or maintains

shall cause such Non-Company Affiliates to assign to Buyer (or such Acquired
Company), all of the rights and obligations of such Non-Company Affiliates, as
applicable, relating to periods from and after the Closing under the Assigned
Contracts; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent that any Assigned
Contracts relate to natural gas transportation on a pipeline regulated by
FERC, Sellers obligations under this _Section 6.8(b)_ are conditioned upon
the Non-Company Affiliate successfully releasing its capacity permanently to
Buyer (or such Acquired Company) and being relieved of all payment obligations
under each such Assigned Contract pursuant to the terms of the applicable FERC
Gas Tariff. Each of Sellers and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to achieve any such permanent releases of capacity.

 



 

(c) _Affiliate Shared Services Contracts_. From and after the Closing, Sellers
shall, and shall cause the Non-Company Affiliates party to the Affiliate
Shared Services Contracts to, provide to Buyer and the Acquired Companies the

this Agreement to the contrary:

 



 

(a) Prior to or at the Closing (including by direction of payment of a portion
of the purchase price to a Non-Company Affiliate), Sellers shall cause any and
all Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies to be paid or otherwise satisfied
in full (including through the assumption of any such Indebtedness by a Non-
Company Affiliate) and any and all Liens securing any such Indebtedness to be
released such that Buyer shall take title to the Company Interests free of any
such Indebtedness or any such Liens.

by Sellers or Non-Company Affiliates for the benefit of the Acquired Companies
with respect to the Business until the Closing. All such self-insurance
arrangements shall be terminated as of the Closing and no further liability

elect to reduce the amount of the Purchase Price by the estimated Restoration
Cost (as estimated by a qualified firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer and
Sellers), by notice to Buyer, and such casualty loss shall not affect the
Closing. If Sellers do not make such an election within forty-five (45) days
after the date of such casualty loss, Buyer may elect to terminate this
Agreement within ten (10) Business Days after the end of such forty-five (45)
day period by written notice to Sellers. If the Restoration Cost is in excess
of $250,000,000, Sellers may, by notice to Buyer within forty-five (45) days

election. If the Restoration Cost is $15,000,000 or less, (i) neither Buyer
nor Sellers shall have the right or option to terminate this Agreement and

event that Sellers elect to reduce the Purchase Price in accordance with this
_Section 6.11_, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Non-Company Affiliates
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to collect amounts due (if any) under
available insurance policies or programs in respect of any such casualty loss

Condemnation Value (as determined by a qualified firm reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and Sellers) in excess of $250,000,000, Sellers may elect to reduce the
Purchase Price by such Condemnation Value (less the amount of any condemnation
award and Tax benefits related thereto) by notice to Buyer, and such

notice to Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Sellers do not elect to
terminate this Agreement as provided in this sentence, then Buyer may, by
written notice to Sellers, terminate this Agreement within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt by Buyer of Sellers notice regarding its election. If the
Condemnation Value is $15,000,000 or less, (A) neither Buyer nor Sellers shall
have the right or option to terminate this Agreement and (B) there shall be no
reduction in the amount of the Purchase Price. In the event that Sellers elect

develop and begin to implement a mutually acceptable transition plan for the
migration and integration of the Acquired Companies out of the business of
Sellers and the Non-Company Affiliates and into the business of Buyer, subject
to compliance with applicable Laws (the " ** _Transition Plan_** "). The
Transition Plan shall address the matters set forth on _Schedule 6.13(a)_ as
well as any other matters agreed to by the Parties. Such cooperation shall
include each Party (with Sellers being considered one Party for purposes of
this _Section 6.13_) taking the following actions: (i) promptly after
execution of this Agreement, appointing a transition manager whose primary
responsibility would be to plan and execute the transition and manage such

to be transitioned or migrated, taking into account any issues of separation
arising from the Transition Plan; (iii) reviewing the services provided to the
Acquired Companies under the Affiliate Shared Services Contracts and the
extent to which such services can be provided on a transitional basis; (iv)

shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, work together with Buyer in good
faith and the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare for the transition and migration of the software set forth on
_Schedule 6.13(b)_ identified by Buyer to Sellers as software Buyer intends
to use in connection with the operation of the Business after the Closing (the

licensors of Transitioning Software with the intent of making the
Transitioning Software available to the Acquired Companies and Buyer for the
operation of the Business as currently conducted, effective immediately
following the Closing, subject to Buyers negotiation and agreement with third
party licensors as to the terms and conditions of any license required with
respect thereto and the payment of any fee that may be required. If the
Transitioning Software is not available for use by the Acquired Companies and
Buyer as of the Closing Date, then Sellers or their Non-Company Affiliates
shall continue the efforts described in this _Section 6.13(b)_ under the
terms of the Transition Services Agreement, as and to the extent permissible
under the terms of the Transitioning Software licenses.

 



 

(c) During the Interim Period, the Parties, through their respective
transition teams, shall cooperate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to finalize and refine (through addition, deletion or
modification prior to the Closing) the schedules to the Transition Services
Agreement consistent with any requirements identified in the Transition Plan.
At the Closing, the Parties shall enter into a Transition Services Agreement,
substantially in the form attached hereto as **_Exhibit I_** (the " **
_Transition Services Agreement_** ").

 



 

(d) Within ten (10) Business Days following the Closing (subject to extension
by mutual agreement of the Parties), Buyer shall designate and appoint a
replacement to any representative or agent of each Acquired Company who has
been appointed to a position pursuant to a requirement of any Governmental
Authority or Permit, unless such representative or agent is a Continuing Non-
Unionized Employee or a Unionized Employee, or, if required by any Government
Authority or Permit in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, reconfirm any such currently designated or appointed representative
or agent.

 



 

 **6.14.** ** ****_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary or any
requirement at Law, Buyer shall bear any Transfer Taxes imposed as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall timely file its
Transfer Tax returns as required by Law and shall notify Sellers when such
filings have been made. If either Seller is required by Law to file any
Transfer Tax return, such Seller shall furnish such Transfer Tax return to
Buyer for Buyers review fifteen (15) Business Days before the due date, and
Buyer shall remit the amount shown as due on such Tax return ten (10) Business
Days before the due date of such Tax return to the applicable Seller.

 



 

(b) With respect to any Tax return covering a taxable period ending before the
Closing Date (a " ** _Pre-Closing Taxable Period_** ") that is required to be
filed on or after the Closing Date with respect to an Acquired Company, (i)
Sellers shall cause such Tax return to be prepared and shall deliver such Tax
return as so prepared to Buyer not later than fifteen (15) days (three (3)
days with respect to any property Tax return) prior to the due date (including
extensions) for filing such Tax return for Buyers review and comments, (ii)
with respect to any issue that could materially and adversely affect Buyer or
the applicable Acquired Company in a

 



      
 

 



 

taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning on or after the Closing Date,
Sellers shall cooperate and consult with Buyer to finalize such Tax return,
and if such issue is not resolved prior to the filing due date, such Tax
return shall be filed in form and substance provided to Buyer, with any
modifications agreed to by Sellers and Buyer, and the Parties thereafter shall
amend such Tax return as and to the extent necessary to reflect the final
resolution of such issue, and (iii) subject to Sellers payment to Buyer of
such Tax in compliance with _Section 6.14(c)_, Buyer shall cause such Tax
return to be executed and duly and timely filed with the appropriate Taxing
Authority and shall pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax return.
With respect to any Tax return covering a taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date and ending on or after the Closing Date (a " ** _Straddle Taxable
Period_** ") that is required to be filed on or after the Closing Date, (A)
Buyer shall cause such Tax return to be prepared (in a manner consistent with
practices followed in prior taxable periods except as required by a change in
Law or fact) and shall deliver a draft of such Tax return to Sellers for
Sellers review and approval at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
(including extensions) for filing such Tax return, (B) Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate and consult with each other in order to finalize such Tax return,
and if any issue remains unresolved prior to the filing due date, such Tax
return shall be filed in form and substance provided to Sellers, with any
modifications agreed to by Sellers and Buyer, and the Parties thereafter shall
amend such Tax return as and to the extent necessary to reflect the final
resolution of such issue, and (C) subject to Sellers payment to Buyer of any
portion of such Tax in compliance with _Section 6.14(c)_, Buyer shall cause
such Tax return to be executed and duly and timely filed with the appropriate
Taxing Authority and shall pay all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax
return.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 10.1(b)_, except to the extent included in the
calculation of Net Working Capital, Sellers shall be responsible for and
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties against, and, subject to _Section
6.14(g)_ below, Sellers shall be entitled to all refunds or credits of any Tax
with respect to any Acquired Company that is attributable to a Pre-Closing
Taxable Period or to that portion of a Straddle Taxable Period that ends prior
to the Closing Date. With respect to a Straddle Taxable Period, Sellers and
Buyer shall determine the Tax attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Taxable Period that ends at the end of the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date by an interim closing of the books of the applicable Acquired
Company as of the end of the day prior to the Closing Date, except for ad
valorem or property Taxes and franchise Taxes based solely on capital which
shall be prorated on a daily basis up to the Closing Date. For this purpose,
any franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to an Acquired Company shall be
allocated to the taxable period for which payment of the Tax provides the
right to engage in business, regardless of the taxable period during which the
income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is
measured. In determining whether a property Tax is attributable to a Pre-
Closing Taxable Period or a Straddle Taxable Period, any property Tax that is
based on the assessed value of any assets, property or other rights as of any
lien date or other specified valuation date shall be deemed a property Tax
attributable to the taxable period (whether a fiscal year or other Tax year)
specified on the relevant property Tax bill that is issued with respect to
that lien date or other valuation date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any Coal Project Asset, the calculation of the amount of Tax of
such Coal Project Asset for which Sellers are responsible or entitled to
refunds or credits under this _Section 6.14(c)_ shall be made by reference to
the applicable Sellers undivided interest in such Assets.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 10.1(a)_, Buyer shall be responsible for and
indemnify Sellers against, and Buyer shall be entitled to all refunds and
credits of, all Taxes of the Acquired Companies that are attributable to a
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning on or after the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) With respect to any Tax for which Sellers are responsible, Sellers shall
have the right, at their sole cost and expense, to initiate any claim for
refund and to control (in the case of a Pre-Closing Taxable Period) or
participate in (in the case of a Straddle Taxable Period) the prosecution,
settlement or compromise of any proceeding involving such Tax, including the
determination of the value of property for purposes of real and personal
property ad valorem Taxes (a " ** _Tax Matter_** "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Party shall enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise
any material Tax Matter that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect
the Tax liability of the other Party in any material respect without the other
Partys prior written consent, not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or
withheld. Buyer shall and shall cause the relevant Acquired Company to, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Coal Participant
Project Operators to, take such action in connection with any such proceeding
as Sellers shall reasonably request from time to time to implement the
preceding sentence, including the selection of counsel and experts and the
execution of powers of attorney. Buyer shall and shall cause the relevant
Acquired Company to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Coal Participant Project Operators to, give written notice to
Sellers of its receipt of any notice of any audit, examination, claim or
assessment for any Tax for which any Seller is responsible within twenty (20)
days after its receipt of such notice; failure to give any such written notice
within such twenty (20) day period shall limit Sellers indemnification
obligation pursuant to this Agreement to the extent any Sellers are actually
prejudiced by such failure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
_Section 10.6_, this _Section 6.14(e)_ and not _Section 10.6_ will apply to
third-party Claims with respect to Taxes.

 



 

(f) Sellers shall grant to Buyer (or its designees) access at all reasonable
times to all of the information, books and records (excluding workpapers and
correspondence with Taxing Authorities) relating solely to the Acquired
Companies within the possession of Sellers, and shall afford Buyer (or its
designees) the right (at Buyers expense) to take extracts therefrom and to
make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Buyer (or
its designees) to prepare Tax returns, respond to Tax audits and
investigations, prosecute Tax protests, appeals and refund claims and to
conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities. Buyer shall and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Coal Participant Project Operators to, grant to Sellers (or their
respective designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the
information, books and records (including workpapers and correspondence with
Taxing Authorities) relating to the Acquired Companies for Pre-Closing Taxable
Periods or Straddle Taxable Periods within the possession of Buyer, the
Acquired Companies, the Coal Participant Project Operators and the employees
of Buyer and the Acquired Companies, and shall afford and cause the Acquired
Companies to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Coal Participant Project Operators to, afford Sellers (or their respective
designees) the right (at Sellers expense) to take extracts therefrom and to
make copies thereof, in each case to the extent reasonably necessary to permit
Sellers (or their respective designees) to prepare Tax returns, respond to Tax
audits and investigations, prosecute Tax protests, appeals and refund claims
and to conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities.

 



      
 

 



 

After the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Coal Participant Project Operators to, preserve all information,
records or documents in their respective possessions relating to liabilities
for Taxes of the Acquired Companies for Pre-Closing Taxable Periods or
Straddle Taxable Periods until six (6) months after the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations (including extensions thereof) with respect
to the assessment of such Taxes; _provided_ that no Party shall dispose of any
of the foregoing items without first offering such items to the other Parties.

 



 

(g) If after the Closing, Buyer or an Acquired Company receives a refund or
utilizes a credit of any Tax of such Acquired Company attributable to a Pre-
Closing Taxable Period or that portion of a Straddle Taxable Period ending at
the end of the date immediately prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to
Sellers within ten (10) Business Days after such receipt or utilization an
amount equal to such refund received or credit utilized, together with any
interest received or credited thereon, net of reasonable third-party fees or
expenses incurred by Buyer or the Acquired Companies in obtaining such refund
or credit payable to Sellers attributable to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period or
that portion of a Straddle Taxable Period ending at the end of the date
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a refund
or credit of any Tax of any Acquired Company attributable to a Pre-Closing
Taxable Period or that portion of a Straddle Taxable Period ending at the end
of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date or to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any such Tax that could be imposed for a Pre-Closing Taxable Period
or that portion of a Straddle Taxable Period ending at the end of the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

(h) In the event that a Seller initiates a claim for refund from a Taxing
Authority with regard to any Tax of an Acquired Company attributable to a Pre-
Closing Taxable Period or that portion of a Straddle Taxable Period ending at
the end of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, whether the
initiation of such claim begins prior to or after the Closing, Sellers shall
have all rights to and interest in such refund. Buyer shall, upon request,
provide Sellers a limited power of attorney allowing Sellers to pursue such
claim for refund with and collect such refund from such Taxing Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not settle any such claim in a
manner that could materially and adversely affect Buyer or the applicable
Acquired Company in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning on or
after the Closing Date without Buyers prior written consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(i) In the event that a Seller initiates a claim for refund from a third party
who improperly withheld sales and use Tax, or withheld excessive sales and use
Tax, with regard to an Acquired Company attributable to a Pre-Closing Taxable
Period or that portion of a Straddle Taxable Period ending at the end of the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date, whether the initiation of such
claim begins prior to or after the Closing, Sellers shall have all rights to
and interest in such refund. Buyer shall, upon request, provide Sellers a
limited power of attorney allowing Sellers to pursue such claim for refund
with and collect such refund from such third party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers shall not settle any such claim in a manner that could
materially and adversely affect Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company in a
taxable

 



      
 

 



 

period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date without Buyers
prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



 

(j) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, comply with the covenants relating to tax-exempt pollution
control bonds set forth on _Schedule 6.14(j)_.

 



 

 **6.15.** ** ****_Further Assurances_**. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the Closing, at any
Partys request and without further consideration, the other Parties shall
execute and deliver to such Party such other instruments of sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and
information and take such other actions as such Party may reasonably request
in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **6.16.** ** ****_Competing Transactions_**. Buyer shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Affiliates to (a) acquire or agree to acquire any electric
generation Assets or business, or (b) acquire or agree to acquire, whether by
merger, consolidation, by purchasing any portion of the Assets of or equity
in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division thereof owning,
operating or otherwise controlling any electric generation Assets or business,
if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating thereto or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be
expected to (i) delay beyond the Outside Date (x) the expiration of any
applicable waiting period or (y) the obtaining, or materially increasing the
risk of not obtaining, any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or
approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) materially increase the risk
of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting such transactions,
or (iii) delay beyond the Outside Date or otherwise materially impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **6.17.** ** ****_Public Announcements_**. During the Interim Period, except
as required by Law or by the rules of, or an applicable listing agreement
with, a national securities exchange, each of Sellers and Buyer shall consult
with the other and obtain the consent of the other (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press
releases or any public statements with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, each Party and its Affiliates may
make internal announcements regarding this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to its respective directors and officers and employees
without the consent of the other Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement shall prohibit any
Party from communicating with any Governmental Authorities or third parties
(including representatives of labor unions) to the extent reasonably necessary
for the purpose of (a) seeking any consents or approvals of, making any
filings with or providing any notifications to, any such Governmental
Authority or third party nor shall any Party be liable for any public
disclosure made by any such Governmental Authority or third party with respect
thereto, (b) responding to customer and counterparty questions and concerns
regarding this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and the
transition of the Businesses of the Acquired Companies and/or (c) in
connection with any Financing.

 **6.18.** ** ****_Confidentiality_**. The provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall remain
binding and in full force and effect on and after the date hereof until the
earlier of the expiration of its term or the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyers confidentiality obligations with respect to Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) shall terminate only
in respect of that portion of the Confidential Information exclusively
relating to the Acquired Companies or the Business, and the confidentiality
obligations not relating exclusively to the Acquired Companies or the Business
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of two (2) years
following the Closing Date. If, for any reason, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are not consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of two (2) years following the
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above or the
Confidentiality Agreement, nothing in this Agreement or the Confidentiality
Agreement shall prevent Buyer or any of its subsidiaries from disclosing any
information, including "Confidential Information" and the information provided
pursuant to _Section 6.23_, (i) to any Financing Source in connection with
any Financing, (ii) in an offering circular, prospectus, bank book, comfort
letters or private placement memorandum in connection with any Financing,
(iii) for the purposes of establishing a "due diligence" defense in connection
with any Financing, (iv) to the extent reasonably necessary to perform any
diligence with respect to, or confirm the accuracy of the information provided
pursuant to _Section 6.23_, (v) with Sellers consent, as applicable, or (vi)

to maintain the effectiveness of its shelf registration statement on Form
S-3ASR; _provided_ that (x) with respect to any disclosure of such information
to a Commitment Party (as defined in the Commitment Letter), to the extent
applicable to such Commitment Party, such recipient shall be subject to
confidentiality obligations consistent with those set forth in the second
paragraph of Section 9 of the Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date
hereof); and (y) with respect to any disclosure of information that
constitutes "Confidential Information" under the terms of the Confidential
Agreement or as otherwise has been identified in writing by Sellers to Buyer
as being confidential to any recipient that is not subject to confidentiality
obligations substantially similar to those under the Confidentiality
Agreement, this Agreement or those set forth in the immediately preceding
clause, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with
Sellers with respect to the confidentiality of any such information and the
preparation of any disclosure including such information.

 



 

 **6.19.** ** ****_Updates; Supplements to Schedules_**. From time to time
prior to the Closing, Sellers shall be entitled to supplement, amend or modify
the Schedules to _Article III_, _Article IV_ or _Schedule 6.5(a)_ to
reflect (a) the entering into, amendment of or termination of Material
Contracts as permitted by _Section 6.3(a)(x)_, (b) changes to Support
Obligations as contemplated by _Section 6.5(g)_ and (c) factors,
circumstances or events first arising or, in the case of representations given
to Sellers Knowledge, becoming known to Sellers during the Interim Period
(each, a " ** _Schedule Supplement_** ") by providing Buyer with written
notice specifying the schedule or schedules to be updated thereby. Each such
Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to supplement, amend and modify the
Schedules for all purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ that a Schedule
Supplement pursuant to clause (c) above shall not affect Buyers right with
respect to indemnification hereunder, except as otherwise set forth in this
_Section 6.19_. If any Schedule Supplement pursuant to clause (c) above
discloses any matter or circumstance that has or would reasonably be expected
to have, either individually or in the aggregate with all prior

 



      
 

 



 

Schedule Supplements pursuant to clause (c) above, a Material Adverse Effect
or result in the failure of any of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Article VII_, Buyer may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(e)_ upon written notice of termination delivered to Sellers not later than
ten (10) Business Days following Buyers receipt of the applicable Schedule
Supplement. If Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(e)_ but does not elect to terminate this Agreement within ten
(10) Business Days of its receipt of such Schedule Supplement and the Closing
occurs, then Buyer shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ with respect to such
Schedule Supplement and, further, shall have irrevocably waived its right to
indemnification under _Section 10.2(a)_ with respect to such matter or
circumstance, and such Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to amend the
Schedules, to qualify the relevant representations and warranties contained
herein with respect to such Schedule Supplement and to cure any breach of a
representation or warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder.

 



 

 **6.20.** ** ****_Separation of Generation and Transmission Assets and
Operations_**. Buyer acknowledges that DEO, Sellers and the other Non-Company
Affiliates of Sellers have undertaken a project involving the physical
separation of the transmission Assets (none of which constitute Purchased
Assets) located at the sites of the Coal Operator Projects and the Dicks Creek
Project from the generation Assets located at those sites, as described on
_Schedule 6.20_ (the " ** _GT Separation_** "). From and after the date
hereof, DEO, Sellers and the other Non-Company Affiliates of Sellers shall be
entitled to continue the GT Separation work until its completion, solely at
the expense of DEO, Sellers and/or the other Non-Company Affiliates. From and
after the Closing and until the GT Separation work is complete, Buyer shall,
and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, (i) work diligently with DEO,
Sellers and the other Non-Company Affiliates of Sellers in scheduling the GT
Separation work during scheduled outages at the sites of the Coal Operator
Projects and the Dicks Creek Project; _provided_ that Buyer agrees that all
such GT Separation work shall be scheduled to permit its completion no later
than December 31, 2018, (ii) provide access to the sites and Assets at the
Coal Operator Projects and the Dicks Creek Project as reasonably requested by
DEO, Sellers and/or their Non-Company Affiliates in accordance with the Access
Agreements and (iii) cooperate with DEO, Sellers and their Non-Company
Affiliates in the performance and completion of the GT Separation work;
_provided_ that no such GT Separation work shall unreasonably interfere with
the business of Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

 **6.21.** ** ****_Related Agreements_**. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in _Section 6.3_, Sellers shall be permitted to cause the
applicable Acquired Companies to enter into the Related Agreements with Non-
Company Affiliates during the Interim Period. In the event that any Related
Agreement has not been entered into prior to the Closing, the Parties shall,
and shall cause their relevant Affiliates to, execute and deliver any such
Related Agreement, substantially in the form attached as an _Annex_ to
_Schedule 6.21_ , if applicable, at the time of the Closing, or, if any
approvals or consents required to implement such Related Agreement have not
been obtained as of the time of the Closing, following the Closing promptly
upon obtaining such approvals and consents. In the event that the OandM
Agreement is not entered into as of the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause
DE Miami Fort to, apply the terms and conditions of the existing operation
agreement for the generating plant known as Unit 6 located at the site of the
Miami Fort Project in a manner consistent with the past practices of DE Miami
Fort and its predecessor Affiliates. In addition, Sellers shall (a) use their
commercially reasonable efforts to

 



      
 

 



 

enter into the Interconnection Agreements as promptly as practicable,
recognizing that the timing of the entry into such agreements is dependent in
part on the actions of third parties and (b) comply with the arrangements set
forth on _Schedule 6.21_.

 



 

 **6.22.** ** ****_Real Property Matters_**. Sellers shall and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to reasonably cooperate with Buyer by providing reasonably
requested documentation in the possession, or under the control of, the
Acquired Companies, prior to and at the Closing, in connection with Buyer
obtaining ALTA Owners Policies of Title Insurance with the deletion of the
requirements described in Schedule B-I of the title commitments, the deletion
of the "gap" exception and the other standard exceptions and the attachment of
any and all available, reasonable and customary endorsements required by Buyer
and any Financing Source (obtained at Buyers sole cost and expense) covering
all of the Real Property effective as of the Closing Date, including executing
customary affidavits required by Buyers title insurance company, including
the affidavit substantially in the form of _Schedule 6.22_ (" ** _Title
Company Affidavit_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall not be
required to provide any indemnities or guaranties in favor of the title
insurance company, Buyer or any other party in connection with this _Section
6.22_ other than (i) a reasonable and customary "Non-Imputation Affidavit" and
(ii) the indemnity contained in the Title Company Affidavit. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be responsible for all costs
related to any title policies, "marked-up" title commitments and endorsements.

 



 

 **6.23.** ** ****_Financing Cooperation_**.

 



 

(a) Sellers (including their respective subsidiaries and the Acquired
Companies) shall during the Interim Period:

 



 

(i) provide cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer (x) in connection with
one or more financing transactions, all or a portion of the proceeds of which
will be used to fund the Purchase Price or related fees and expenses, or any
offerings that are registered under Buyers existing shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 (each, a " ** _Financing_** ") and (y) in order for
Buyer to comply with its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and its
obligation to maintain the availability of its existing shelf registration
statement on Form S-3, which cooperation shall include using commercially
reasonable efforts to: (A) cooperate with the marketing efforts for each
Financing, including causing the appropriate senior management and employees
of the Acquired Companies, on a customary basis and upon reasonable advance
notice, to participate in a reasonable number of customary meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and rating agency sessions,
including direct contact (coordinated through Sellers Representatives) with
senior management of the Acquired Companies (and other employees with
appropriate seniority and expertise in the Business) and advisors; (B) assist
with the preparation of customary financing and marketing materials to be used
in connection with any Financing (including providing customary authorization
letters and access to due diligence materials), and identifying any portion of
the information set forth in such materials that would constitute material
non-public information; (C) furnish all financial statements, financial data,
audit reports and other financial information and other information regarding
the Acquired Companies of the type and form, and within the times, required by
Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X

 



       
 

 



 

under the 1933 Act for offerings on a registration statement on Form S-3 by an
accelerated filer, including all information required to be incorporated by
reference therein, and of the type and form customarily included in documents
to be used for the syndication of credit facilities; (D) cooperate, to the
extent the satisfaction of such condition requires the cooperation of, or is
within the control of, Sellers or the Acquired Companies, in satisfying the
conditions precedent set forth in any definitive document relating to any
Financing, but only to the extent that such conditions are set forth on
_Exhibit D_ of the Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date hereof); (E)
cause the independent accountants of Sellers or the Acquired Companies, as
applicable, to provide reasonable assistance and cooperation, including
providing consents and customary comfort letters; and (F) furnish all

regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001; and

of (x) thirty-five (35) days after the date of execution of this Agreement (or
sooner, if available) and (y) Closing, (A) audited financial statements,
including combined balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of
cash flows, statements of stockholders equity of the Acquired Companies as of
and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, as required by, and
in compliance with GAAP and Regulation S-X, and (B) unaudited financial
statements, including combined balance sheets, statements of operations and
statements of cash flows of the Acquired Companies as of and for the three and
six month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2014 (which shall have been reviewed
by the independent accountants for the Acquired Companies, as provided in the
procedures specified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in AU
722), as required by, and in compliance with GAAP and Regulation S-X.

 



 

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) the obtaining of the Financing is
not a condition to the Closing and (ii) none of Buyers respective obligations
under this Agreement are conditioned in any manner upon Buyer or any of its
Affiliates obtaining any financing in respect of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or otherwise, nothing contained
in this _Section 6.23_ shall require any such cooperation to the extent it
would unreasonably disrupt the conduct of Sellers and the Non-Company
Affiliates respective businesses. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
each of Sellers and the Non-Company Affiliates and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and the performance
of their respective obligations under this _Section 6.23_, including efforts
to identify material non-public information, in each case other than (i) with
respect to any information provided by or on behalf of Sellers or any of the
Non-Company Affiliates pursuant to this _Section 6.23_ or (ii) to the extent
any of such Losses arise from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of, or material breach of this Agreement by Sellers or any of the
Non-Company Affiliates and their respective Representatives. Buyer shall,
promptly upon request of Sellers, reimburse Sellers and the Non-Company
Affiliates for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Sellers and the Non-Company Affiliates (including those of their
respective Representatives) in connection with the cooperation required by
this _Section 6.23_. In addition,

 



      
 

 



 

none of the Acquired Companies shall be required to undertake any liability or
obligation under any agreement or document related to the Financing, unless
and until the Closing occurs or incur any liability in connection with the
Financing prior to the Closing, other than as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VII 
BUYERS CONDITIONS TO CLOSING**

 



 

The obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing is subject to the
fulfillment of each of the following conditions (except to the extent waived
in writing by Buyer in its sole discretion):

 



 

 **7.1.** ** ****_Representations and Warranties_**. (a) The representations
and warranties made by Sellers in _Articles III_ and _IV_ (other than the
Sellers Fundamental Representations and under _Section 4.8(b)_) shall be true
and accurate on and as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the
Closing Date or, in the case of representations and warranties that speak as

to any breach of the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of
Sellers under this Agreement, the certificates to be delivered by Sellers
pursuant to _Section 7.3_ or the Company Assignment Agreement or the

instrument or certificate delivered pursuant hereto, whether based on
contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise, except as provided
in this _Article X_ and _Section 6.14(c)_, and, should the Closing occur,

 ** **

 

 **10.6.** ** ****_Procedure with Respect to Third-Party Claims_**.

 



 

(a) If any Party (or as to Buyer after the Closing, any Acquired Company)
becomes subject to a pending Claim or Claim threatened in writing by a third
party and such Party (the " ** _Claiming Party_** ") believes it has a Claim
against another Party (the " ** _Responding Party_** ") under this _Article
X_ as a result, then the Claiming Party shall notify the Responding Party in
writing of the basis for such Claim setting forth the nature of the Claim in
reasonable detail. The failure of the Claiming Party to so notify the
Responding Party shall not relieve the Responding Party of liability hereunder
except to the extent that the defense of such Claim is prejudiced by the
failure to give such notice.

 



 

(b) If any proceeding is brought by a third party against a Claiming Party and
the Claiming Party gives notice to the Responding Party pursuant to this
_Section 10.6_, the Responding Party shall be entitled to participate in such
proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense of such
proceeding, if (i) the Responding Party provides written notice to the
Claiming Party that the Responding Party intends to undertake such defense,
(ii) the Responding Party conducts the defense of the third-party Claim
actively and diligently with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming
Party and (iii) if the Responding Party is a party to the proceeding, the
Responding Party or the Claiming Party has not determined in good faith that
joint representation would be inappropriate because of a conflict in interest.
The Claiming Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to employ
separate counsel (who may be selected by the Claiming Party in its sole
discretion) in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, and
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such Claiming Party.
The Claiming Party shall fully cooperate with the Responding Party and its
counsel in the defense or compromise of such Claim. If the Responding Party
assumes the defense of a proceeding, no compromise or settlement of such
Claims may be effected by the Responding Party without the Claiming Partys
consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or
any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other Claims
that may be made against the Claiming Party and (B) the sole relief provided
is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Responding Party.

 



 

(c) If (i) notice is given to the Responding Party of the commencement of any
third-party legal proceeding and the Responding Party does not, within thirty
(30) days after the Claiming Partys notice is given, give notice to the
Claiming Party of its election to assume the defense of such legal proceeding,
(ii) any of the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of _Section
10.6(b)_ above become unsatisfied or (iii) a Claiming Party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a legal proceeding may
adversely affect it other than as a result of monetary damages for which it
would be entitled to indemnification from the Responding Party under this
Agreement, then the Claiming Party shall (upon notice to the Responding Party)
have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Responding Party shall reimburse the
Claiming Party for the costs of defending against such third-party Claim
(including reasonable attorneys fees and

 



      
 

 



 

expenses) and shall remain otherwise responsible for any liability with
respect to amounts arising from or related to such third-party Claim, in both

 **10.7.** ** ****_Procedures with Respect to Retained Seller Actions._**

 



 

(a) Sellers hereby assume, and shall have the sole and exclusive authority and
control over, the defense, investigation, commencement, prosecution,
litigation, management, conduct, appeal and other rights in connection with
all matters whatsoever (including, as applicable, litigation strategy and
choice of legal counsel and other professionals) in connection with any Claims
resulting from the matters set forth as items 2 and 6 on _Schedule 4.5_ (each,
a " ** _Retained Seller Action_** "). In furtherance of the foregoing:

 



 

(i) each of Buyer, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate as reasonably
requested by Sellers or any Non-Company Affiliates and make readily available
to and afford to Sellers, the Non-Company Affiliates and their respective
Representatives reasonable access to their Representatives, properties and
books and records, subject to appropriate and reasonable confidentiality
agreements ( _provided_ that the terms of any such agreement do not restrict
actions to be taken in connection with the defense of any Retained Seller
Action), to the extent reasonably related to such Retained Seller Action.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Buyer, the Acquired
Companies and their respective Affiliates shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to make available their Representatives for fact finding,
consultation and interviews, and as witnesses to the extent that any such
Person may reasonably be required in connection with any Retained Seller
Action. Access to such Persons shall be granted for reasonable periods of time
during normal business hours or as otherwise mutually agreed. The provision of
access and other services pursuant to this _Section 10.7(a)(i)_ shall be at
no additional cost or expense of Sellers, other than for reasonable out-of-
pocket expense;

 



 

(ii) Sellers may, without consent of Buyer, any Acquired Company or their
respective Affiliates, compromise or settle any Retained Seller Action or
consent to entry of judgment with respect thereto that requires solely money
damages paid by Sellers. Any other disposition by Sellers of any Retained
Seller Action shall be subject to the consent of Buyer, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and

 



 

(iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Sellers shall not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Party against any attorneys fees incurred by Buyer in connection
with any Retained Seller Action unless Buyer reasonably shall have concluded
(upon advice of its legal counsel) that, with respect to any Retained Seller
Action, Buyer and Sellers may have different, conflicting or adverse legal
positions or interests.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, cooperate with
Sellers and the Non-Company Affiliates in having any Seller or a Non-Company
Affiliate substituted as the named party, the costs of obtaining such
substitution to be borne by Sellers or such Non-Company Affiliates. Absent a
substitution, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to,
cooperate and assist as is reasonably needed (to the extent requested) in
satisfying any procedural requirements in connection with any Retained Seller
Action, which is being defended by any Seller or a Non-Company Affiliate,
including by filing papers on such Sellers or Non-Company Affiliates behalf.
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such substitution.

 



 

(c) None of the Buyer, the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates
shall intentionally take any action or omit to take any action for the purpose
of interfering with or adversely affecting the rights and powers of any Seller
or Non-Company Affiliate pursuant to this _Section 10.7_.

 



 

 **10.8.** ** ****_Access to Information_**. After the Closing Date, Sellers
and Buyer shall grant each other (or their respective designees), and Buyer
shall cause the Acquired Companies to grant to Sellers (or their respective
designees), access at all reasonable times to all of the information, books
and records relating to the Acquired Companies in their respective possession,
and shall afford each such Party the right (at such Partys expense) to take
extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably
necessary to implement the provisions of, or to investigate or defend any
Claims between the Parties arising under, this Agreement.

 **11.4.** ** ****_Disclosure_**. Each Seller may, at its option, include in
the Schedules items that are not material in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and any such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts,
shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or representation that such items
are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define further
the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement. Information
disclosed in any Schedule shall constitute a disclosure for purposes of all
other Schedules notwithstanding the lack of specific cross-reference thereto,
to the extent the applicability of such disclosure to such other Schedule is
reasonably apparent on its face.

 



 

 **11.5.** ** ****_Waiver_**. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be
waived at any time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but
no such waiver shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument
duly executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No
waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or
more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or
any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, shall
be cumulative and not alternative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no waiver
with respect to the provisions of which any Financing Source of Buyer is
expressly made a third party beneficiary pursuant to _Section 11.7_ (and the
related definitions and other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a
waiver would serve to modify the substance or provisions of such sections)
shall be permitted in a manner adverse to any Financing Source of Buyer
without the prior written consent of the arrangers and lenders providing such
Financing.

 



 

 **11.6.** ** ****_Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented
or modified only by a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendments or modifications with
respect to the provisions of which any Financing Source of Buyer is expressly
made a third party beneficiary pursuant to _Section 11.7_ (and the related
definitions and other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a
modification would serve to modify the substance or provisions of such
sections) shall be permitted in a manner adverse to any Financing Source of
Buyer without the prior written consent of the arrangers and lenders providing
such Financing.

 



 

 **11.7.** ** ****_No Third Party Beneficiary_**. Except for (x) the
provisions of _Section 6.2(b)_ (Indemnification for Access), _Section
6.5(d)(ii)_ (Indemnification for Contributing Support Obligations), Section
6.14(d)(Tax Indemnity), _Schedule 6.14(j)_ (Tax-Exempt Bond Matters),
_Sections 10.1(a)_ (Indemnification by Sellers) and _(b)_ (Indemnification

Party Beneficiary), _Section 11.13_ (Governing Law; Venue; Jurisdiction),
_Section 11.14_ (Waiver of Jury Trial), and _Section 11.15_ (Finance-Related
Arrangements) (which in the case of clause (y) are expressly intended to
benefit the Financing Sources), the terms and provisions of this Agreement are
intended solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors
or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer
third-party

 



      
 

 



 

beneficiary rights upon any other Person, including any Continuing Non-
Unionized Employee or Unionized Employee, any beneficiary or dependents
thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof.

 



 

 **11.8.** ** ****_Assignment; Binding Effect_**. Buyer may assign its rights
and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate or Affiliates of Buyer, or to
Buyers lenders for collateral security purposes, but such assignment shall
not release Buyer from its obligations hereunder. Except as provided in the
preceding sentence, neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or
obligation hereunder may be assigned by any Party without the prior written
consent of the other Parties and any attempt to do so shall be void, except
for assignments and transfers by operation of Law. Subject to this _Section
11.8_, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

 



 

 **11.9.** ** ****_Specific Performance_**. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that a breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the other
Parties and that the non-breaching Parties shall not have an adequate remedy
at law. Therefore, it is agreed that in the event of such a breach, the non-
breaching Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief, specific performance
or other equitable remedies to enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan,
the City of New York, New York, in addition to any other remedies it may have
at law or in equity. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not
exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any Party may
have under this Agreement or otherwise.

 



 

 **11.10.** ** ****_Headings_**. The headings used in this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the
provisions hereof.

 



 

 **11.11.** ** ****_Invalid Provisions_**. If any provision of this Agreement
is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future
Law, and if the rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement shall
not be materially and adversely affected thereby, such provision shall be
fully severable, this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this
Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.

 



 

 **11.12.** ** ****_Counterparts; Facsimile_**. This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any
facsimile copies hereof or signature hereon shall, for all purposes, be deemed
originals.

 



 

 **11.13.** ** ****_Governing Law; Venue; Jurisdiction_**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict or choice
of law provision that would require or permit the application of the Laws of
any other jurisdiction.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in _Sections 2.6 and 2.7_ , each Party to
this Agreement irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state
or federal court within the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, New
York with respect to any proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including any proceeding arising out of or relating to any
Financing or the performance thereof, and hereby irrevocably agrees that all
Claims in respect of any such proceeding shall be heard and determined in such
state or federal court. Each Party to this Agreement hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such proceeding, including with
respect to any proceeding arising out of or relating to any Financing or the
performance thereof, and agrees that it will not bring, and will not permit
any of its Affiliates to bring, any proceeding relating to this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating to any Financing or the
performance thereof by the Acquired Companies or their officers, employees,
advisors and other Representatives, in any court other than a state or federal
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York. The Parties
further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that final and unappealable
judgment against any of them in any proceeding contemplated above shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the
United States by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

 



 

 **11.14.** ** ****_Waiver of Jury Trial_**. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY
OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS, THE RELATED AGREEMENTS OR ANY OTHER
AGREEMENTS OR CERTIFICATES EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR THE
ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR
THEREIN (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF). NO PARTY TO
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY PROCEEDING OR ANY OTHER
LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES (INCLUDING ANY FINANCING OR
THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF). NO PARTY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION
IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY
TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES
THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT, ANY RELATED AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENT OR AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN
THIS _SECTION 11.14_. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO
ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION 11.14_ SHALL NOT BE
FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

 



 

 **11.15.** ** ****_Finance-Related Arrangements_**. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, each Seller agrees on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates that none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability or
obligation to such Seller or any of its respective

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates relating to this Agreement, any related documentation or any of the
transactions contemplated herein or therein (including any Financing). This
_Section 11.15_ is intended to benefit and may be enforced by any Financing
