AND PLAN OF MERGER    THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " Agreement")
is made and entered into as of October 29, 2000, by and between
REPUBLIC SECURITY FINANCIAL CORPORATION ("Republic"), a corporation organized
and existing under the Laws of the State of Florida, with its principal
office located in West Palm Beach, FL; and WACHOVIA CORPORATION ("Buyer"),
a corporation organized and existing under the Laws of the State of
North Carolina, with its principal offices located in Winston-Salem, NC
and Atlanta, GA.    PREAMBLE   The Boards of Directors of Republic and
Buyer are of the opinion that the transactions described herein are in the
best interests of the parties to this Agreement and their respective
stockholders. This Agreement provides for the acquisition of Republic by
Buyer pursuant to the merger of Republic with and into a wholly owned
subsidiary of Buyer to be organized under the laws of the State of North
Carolina ("Newco"). At the effective time of the merger, the outstanding
shares of the capital stock of Republic shall be converted into shares of the
common stock of Buyer (except as provided herein). As a result, stockholders
of Republic shall become stockholders of Buyer, and each of the subsidiaries
of Republic shall continue to conduct its business and operations as an
indirect subsidiary of Buyer. The transactions described in this Agreement
are subject to the approvals of the stockholders of Republic, the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and certain state
regulatory authorities, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions
described in this Agreement. It is the intention of the parties to this
Agreement that the Merger for federal income tax purposes shall qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan
of reorganization" for purposes of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
Code. As conditions and inducements to Buyer\'s entering into this
Agreement, Republic has entered into a Termination Fee Agreement with Buyer,
the President and Chief Executive Officer of Republic has entered into
an Employment Agreement with Buyer and the non-employee directors of
Republic have entered into Noncompetition Agreements with Buyer.   Certain
terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 11.1 of this
Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual
warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, the
Parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1  TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF
MERGER  1.1 MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, Republic shall be merged with and into Newco in
accordance with the provisions of Section 607.1107 of the FBCA and Section
55-11-07 of the NCBCA and with the effect provided in Section 607.1106 of the
FBCA and Section 55-11-06 of the NCBCA, respectively (the "Merger"). Newco
shall be the Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger and shall
continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of North Carolina. The
Merger shall be consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, which
has been approved and adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of
Republic and Buyer and will be approved and adopted by the Board of Directors
of Newco upon its formation.  1.2 TIME AND PLACE OF CLOSING. The
consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 6:00 P.M. on
the date that the Effective Time occurs (or the immediately preceding day if
the Effective Time is earlier than 9:00 A.M.), or at such other time as the
Parties, acting through their duly authorized officers, may mutually agree.
The place of Closing shall be at such location as may be mutually agreed upon
by the Parties.  1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall become effective on the date and at the
time the Florida Articles of Merger reflecting the Merger shall become
effective with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida and the North
Carolina Certificate of Merger reflecting the Merger shall become effective
with the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina (the "Effective
Time"). Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, unless otherwise
mutually agreed upon by the duly authorized officers of each Party, the
Parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause the Effective Time to
occur on such date as may be designated by Buyer within the fifth business
day to occur after the last of the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other
than the conditions relating to items to be delivered on the day of the
Closing) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement (or, at the election of Buyer, on the first business day of
the month immediately succeeding the month in which such day occurs).  1.4
INTEGRATION. Following the Effective Time, the Parties currently intend to
effectuate, or cause to be effectuated, the combination (the
"Subsidiary Combination") of the business of Republic Security Bank with that
of Wachovia Bank, National Association. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement, Republic agrees to cooperate with Buyer and to take
all reasonable actions prior to or following the Effective Time,
including executing all requisite documentation, as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer to effect the Subsidiary Combination. Subject to the terms
of this Agreement, Republic also agrees to cooperate with Buyer and to take
all reasonable restructuring steps for regulatory purposes, as may
be reasonably requested by Buyer to merge or otherwise consolidate such
legal entities to the extent desirable for regulatory or other
reasons.  1.5 PLAN OF MERGER. The Parties agree to enter into (and Buyer
agrees to cause Newco to enter into) a separate plan of merger, in
substantially the form of Exhibit 1 (the "Plan of Merger"), for purposes of
any filing requirement.   ARTICLE 2  TERMS OF MERGER  2.1 ARTICLES OF
INCORPORATION. The Articles of Incorporation of Newco in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time until otherwise amended or
repealed.  2.2 BYLAWS. The Bylaws of Newco in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation after
the Effective Time until otherwise amended or repealed.  2.3 DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS. The directors of Newco in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time, together with such additional persons as may thereafter be elected,
shall serve as the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
The officers of Newco in office immediately prior to the Effective Time,
together with such additional persons as may thereafter be elected, shall
serve as the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.   ARTICLE 3  MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES  3.1 CONVERSION OF
SHARES. Subject to the provisions of this Article 3, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Newco or
Republic, or the stockholders of any of the foregoing, the shares of the
constituent corporations shall be converted as follows:  (a) Each share of
Newco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the Effective
Time.  (b) Each share of Republic Common Stock (including any associated
stock purchase rights but excluding shares held by any Republic Company or
any Buyer Company, in each case other than in a fiduciary capacity or as
a result of debts previously contracted) issued and outstanding at
the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall by virtue of
this Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into and exchangeable for the number of shares (the
"Exchange Ratio") of the common stock, par value $5.00 per share of Buyer
("Buyer Common Stock"), rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth of a
share, determined by dividing 7.00 by the Average Closing Price (as
defined below); provided that (i) if the Average Closing Price is equal to
or greater than $56.2375, the Exchange Ratio shall be .1245 (the
"Minimum Exchange Ratio") and (ii) if the Average Closing Price is equal to
or less than $46.0125, the Exchange Ratio shall be .1521 (the "Maximum
Exchange Ratio").  3.2 ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS. In the event Republic
changes the number of shares of Republic Common Stock issued and outstanding
prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, or
similar recapitalization with respect to such stock, the Exchange Ratio,
the Minimum Exchange Ratio and the Maximum Exchange Ratio shall
be proportionately adjusted. In the event Buyer changes the number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, or similar
recapitalization with respect to such stock and the record date therefor (in
the case of a stock dividend) or the effective date thereof (in the case of a
stock split or similar recapitalization for which a record date is not
established) shall be prior to the Effective Time, the formula for
calculating the Minimum Exchange Ratio and the Maximum Exchange Ratio shall
be adjusted appropriately.  3.3 SHARES HELD BY REPUBLIC OR BUYER. Each of
the shares of Republic Common Stock held by any Republic Company or by any
Buyer Company, in each case other than in a fiduciary capacity or as a result
of debts previously contracted, shall be cancelled and retired at the
Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.  3.4 FRACTIONAL SHARES. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of shares of Republic Common Stock
exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after taking into
account all certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to a fractional part of a
share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by the market value of one share of
Buyer Common Stock at the Effective Time. The market value of one share of
Buyer Common Stock at the Effective Time shall be the closing price of
Buyer Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (as reported by The Wall
Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, any other authoritative
source selected by Buyer) on the last trading day preceding the Effective
Time. No such holder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any
other rights as a stockholder in respect of any fractional shares.  3.5
CONVERSION OF STOCK RIGHTS.  (a) Except as provided in Section 3.5 (d), at
the Effective Time, each award, option, or other right to purchase or acquire
shares of Republic Common Stock pursuant to stock options, stock appreciation
rights ("SAR\'s"), or stock awards and awards or other rights the value of
which is determined by reference to the value of shares of Republic Common
Stock ("Republic Rights"), in each case granted by Republic under the
Republic Stock Plans, which are outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or
not exercisable, shall be converted into and become rights with respect
to Buyer Common Stock, and Buyer shall assume each Republic Right,
in accordance with the terms of the Republic Stock Plan and stock
option agreement by which it is evidenced, except that from and after
the Effective Time, (i) Buyer and its Compensation Committee shall
be substituted for Republic and the Committee of Republic\'s Board of
Directors (including, if applicable, the entire Board of Directors of
Republic) administering such Republic Stock Plan, (ii) each Republic Right
assumed by Buyer may be exercised solely for shares of Buyer Common Stock (or
cash in the case of stock appreciation rights), (iii) the number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock subject to such Republic Right shall be equal to the
number of shares of Republic Common Stock subject to such Republic Right
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and
rounding down to the nearest whole share, and (iv) the per share exercise
price (or similar threshold price, in the case of stock awards) under each
such Republic Right shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise
(or threshold) price under each such Republic Right by the Exchange Ratio
and rounding up to the nearest cent. In addition, notwithstanding
the provisions of clauses (iii) and (iv) of the first sentence of this
Section 3.5(a), each Republic Right which is an "incentive stock option"
shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Internal Revenue Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a
modification, extension, or renewal of the option, within the meaning of
Section 424(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Republic shall take all action, if any, necessary with respect to the
Republic Stock Plans to permit the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.5(a) and the proviso to the first sentence of Section 3.5(b).  (b) At the
Effective Time, Buyer shall assume the Republic Stock Option Plans; provided
that such assumption shall be only in respect of the Republic Rights assumed
pursuant to Section 3.5(a) and that Buyer shall have no obligation to make
any additional grants or awards under assumed Republic Stock Plans. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Buyer shall deliver to
the participants in each Republic Stock Plan an appropriate notice setting
forth such participant\'s rights pursuant thereto and Republic Rights
pursuant to such Republic Stock Plan shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by Section 3.5(a)
after giving effect to the Merger), and Buyer shall comply with the terms of
each Republic Stock Plan to ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to
the provisions of, such Republic Stock Plan, that Republic Rights which
qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to
qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Buyer shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance sufficient shares of Buyer Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of Republic Rights assumed by it in accordance with this
Section 3.5. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event more than 15
days) after the Effective Time, Buyer shall file a registration statement on
Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other
appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock subject
to such options and shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such options remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who
subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under
Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, where applicable, Buyer shall administer the
Republic Stock Plan assumed pursuant to this Section 3.5 in a manner that
complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act, to the extent it has
been so administered through the Effective Time.  (c) All restrictions or
limitations on transfer with respect to Republic Common Stock awarded under
the Republic Stock Plans or any other plan, program, or arrangement of any
Republic Company, to the extent that such restrictions or limitations shall
not have already lapsed, and except as otherwise expressly provided in such
plan, program, or arrangement, shall remain in full force and effect with
respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock into which such restricted stock is
converted pursuant to Section 3.1 of this Agreement.  (d) Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Section 3.5, (i) Republic shall take all of the
actions set forth in paragraph 2 of Section 7.2(b) of the Republic Disclosure
Memorandum with respect to SAR\'s of Republic at the time set forth in that
paragraph and (ii) at the Effective Time each of the SAR\'s of Republic
referred to in such paragraph shall have been fully satisfied and shall have
ceased to exist.   ARTICLE 4  EXCHANGE OF SHARES  4.1 EXCHANGE
PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer and Republic shall cause
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. or another exchange agent selected by Buyer
(the "Exchange Agent") to mail to the former stockholders of Republic
appropriate transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing shares of Republic Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent). The Exchange Agent may
establish reasonable and customary rules and procedures in connection with
its duties. After the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Republic
Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 of
this Agreement) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time promptly upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares to the
Exchange Agent, together with properly completed transmittal materials, shall
receive in exchange therefor the consideration provided in Section 3.1 of
this Agreement, together with all undelivered dividends and other
distributions in respect of such shares (without interest thereon) pursuant
to Section 4.2 of this Agreement. To the extent required by Section 3.4 of
this Agreement, each holder of shares of Republic Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time also shall receive, upon surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such shares, cash in lieu of any
fractional share of Buyer Common Stock to which such holder may be otherwise
entitled (without interest). Until so surrendered, each outstanding
certificate of Republic Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes, other
than as provided below with respect to voting and the payment of dividends or
other distributions, to represent the consideration into which the number of
shares of Republic Common Stock represented thereby prior to the Effective
Time shall have been converted. Buyer shall not be obligated to deliver the
consideration to which any former holder of Republic Common Stock is entitled
as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders such holder\'s
certificate or certificates representing the shares of Republic Common Stock
for exchange as provided in this Section 4.1. The certificate or certificates
of Republic Common Stock so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the
Exchange Agent may require. Any other provision of this Agreement
notwithstanding, neither the Surviving Corporation, Republic, nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to a holder of Republic Common Stock for any
amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law.  4.2 RIGHTS OF FORMER
REPUBLIC STOCKHOLDERS. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
Republic shall be closed as to holders of Republic Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of Republic Common Stock by any
such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until exchanged in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1 of this Agreement, each
certificate theretofore representing shares of Republic Common Stock (other
than shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.3 of this Agreement) shall
from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right
to receive the consideration provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.4 of this
Agreement in exchange therefor. Former stockholders of record of Republic
shall not be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of
Buyer stockholders until such holders have exchanged their certificates
representing Republic Common Stock for certificates representing Buyer Common
Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Buyer on the Buyer Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares of
Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement, but no dividend or
other distribution payable to the holders of record of Buyer Common Stock as
of any time subsequent to the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder
of any certificate representing shares of Republic Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time until such certificate is exchanged as
provided in Section 4.1 of this Agreement. However, upon exchange of such
Republic Common Stock certificate, both the Buyer Common Stock certificate
(together with all such undelivered dividends or other distributions without
interest) and any undelivered dividends and cash payments to be paid for
fractional share interests (without interest) shall be delivered and paid
with respect to each share represented by such certificate. In the event any
Republic Common Stock certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if required by Buyer,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Buyer may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate, the shares of Buyer
Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   ARTICLE 5  REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF REPUBLIC   Republic hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as
follows:  5.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING, AND POWER. Republic is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Florida, and has the corporate power and authority to carry on
its business as now conducted and to own, lease, and operate its
Material Assets. Republic is duly qualified or licensed to transact business
as a foreign corporation in good standing in the States of the United States
and foreign jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the nature
or conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed,
except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or
licensed is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Republic.  5.2 AUTHORITY; NO BREACH OF
AGREEMENT.  (a) Republic has the corporate power and authority necessary to
execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under this Agreement and
the Termination Fee Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery, and performance of
this Agreement and the Termination Fee Agreement, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein and therein, including the Merger,
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action (including valid authorization and adoption of this Agreement and
the Termination Fee Agreement by Republic\'s duly constituted Board
of Directors) in respect thereof on the part of Republic, subject in the
case of consummation of the Merger to the approval of this Agreement by
the holders of a majority of the shares of Republic Common Stock entitled
to vote thereon, which is the only stockholder vote required for
consummation of the Merger by Republic. Assuming due authorization,
execution, and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer, this Agreement represents
a legal, valid, and binding obligation of Republic, enforceable against
Republic in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium, or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
may be brought).  (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.2 of the Republic
Disclosure Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Republic, nor the consummation by Republic of the transactions
contemplated hereby, nor compliance by Republic with any of the provisions
hereof, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of
Republic\'s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, or (ii) constitute or result
in a Default under, or require any Consent pursuant to, or result in
the creation of any Lien on any Asset of any Republic Company under,
any Contract, Order or Permit of any Republic Company, where such Default
or Lien, or any failure to obtain such Consent, is reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Republic, or (iii) subject to receipt of the requisite Consents referred to
in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement, violate any Law or Order applicable to
any Republic Company or any of their respective Material Assets.  (c) Other
than as disclosed in Section 5.2 of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum, and
other than in connection or compliance with the provisions of the Securities
Laws, applicable state corporate and securities Laws, and rules of the NASD,
and other than Consents required from Regulatory Authorities, and other than
notices to or filings with the Internal Revenue Service or the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or both with respect to any employee benefit
plans, or under the HSR Act, and other than Consents, filings, or
notifications which, if not obtained or made, are not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Republic, no notice to, filing with, or Consent of, any public body or
authority or self-regulatory authority is necessary for the consummation by
Republic of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in this
Agreement or the Termination Fee Agreement.  5.3 CAPITAL STOCK.  (a) The
authorized capital stock of Republic consists, as of the date of this
Agreement, of (i) 500,000,000 shares of Republic Common Stock, of which
48,614,060 (exclusive of treasury stock) shares are issued and outstanding as
of the date of this Agreement and not more than 52,228,654 (exclusive of
treasury stock) shares will be issued and outstanding at the Effective Time,
and (ii) 20,000,000 shares of Republic Preferred Stock, none of which is
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Republic Common
Stock are duly and validly issued and outstanding and are fully paid and
nonassessable. None of the outstanding shares of Republic Common Stock has
been issued in violation of any preemptive rights of the current or past
stockholders of Republic (and are not subject to any preemptive rights).
Republic has reserved not more than 5,800,000 shares of Republic Common Stock
for issuance on the exercise of outstanding stock options and
warrants.  (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.3(a) of this Agreement (with
respect to shares of capital stock) or Section 5.3(b) of the Republic
Disclosure Memorandum or as provided in the Republic Rights Agreement, there
are no shares of capital stock or other equity securities of Republic
outstanding and no outstanding Rights relating to the capital stock of
Republic. The number of shares of Republic Common Stock (or other capital
stock of Republic) that are issuable upon exercise of any outstanding Rights
as of the date of this Agreement is set forth in Section 5.3(b) of
Republic\'s Disclosure Memorandum.  5.4 REPUBLIC SUBSIDIARIES. Republic has
disclosed in Section 5.4 of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum all Republic
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 5.4 of the Republic Disclosure
Memorandum, Republic or one of its wholly owned Subsidiaries owns all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each Republic Subsidiary.
No equity securities of any Republic Subsidiary are or may become required to
be issued (other than to Republic or a wholly owned Republic Subsidiary) by
reason of any Rights, and there are no Contracts by which any Republic
Subsidiary is bound to issue (other than to Republic or a wholly owned
Republic Subsidiary) additional shares of its capital stock or Rights or by
which any Republic Company is or may be bound to transfer any shares of
the capital stock of any Republic Subsidiary (other than to Republic or
a wholly owned Republic Subsidiary). There are no Contracts relating to
the rights of any Republic Company to vote or to dispose of any shares of
the capital stock of any Republic Subsidiary. All of the shares of
capital stock of each Republic Subsidiary held by a Republic Company are
fully paid and nonassessable (except pursuant to 12 U.S.C. ss.55) and are
owned by the Republic Company free and clear of any Lien. Each Republic
Subsidiary is either a bank or a corporation, and is duly organized, validly
existing, and (to the extent applicable) in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized, and has
the corporate power and authority necessary for it to own, lease, and
operate its Assets and to carry on its business as now conducted. Each
Republic Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as a
foreign corporation in good standing in the States of the United States and
foreign jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the nature or
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed, except
for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed is
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Republic. Each Republic Subsidiary that is a
depository institution is an "insured depository institution" as defined in
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and applicable regulations thereunder,
and the deposits in which are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund or
Savings Association Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law.
The minute book and other organizational documents (and all amendments
thereto) for Republic and each Republic Subsidiary that is a
"Significant Subsidiary" (as such term is defined in Regulation S-X
promulgated under the 1934 Act) have been made available to Buyer for its
review, and are true and complete as in effect as of July 31, 2000. No
Material actions have been taken by the Board of Directors of Republic or any
such Republic Subsidiary since such date, other than such actions taken to
authorize the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein, and to authorize actions described in the
Republic Disclosure Memorandum. Republic does not own beneficially, directly
or indirectly, any equity securities or similar interests of any Person,
or any interest in a partnership or joint venture of any kind, other
than equity securities or interests (i) of Republic Subsidiaries, (ii) of
any entity acquired through foreclosure in the ordinary course of business
or (iii) that are owned or controlled in a fiduciary capacity in the
ordinary course of business  5.5 SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  (a)
Republic has filed and made available to Buyer all of Republic\'s
SEC Documents required to be filed with the SEC since December 31,
1995 (collectively, the "Republic SEC Reports"). The Republic SEC Reports (i)
at the time filed, complied in all Material respects with the
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, as the case may be,
and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by
a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of
such filing) contain any untrue statement of a Material fact or omit to state
a Material fact required to be stated in such Republic SEC Reports
or necessary in order to make the statements in such Republic SEC Reports,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Except for any Republic Subsidiaries that are registered as a
broker, dealer, or investment advisor or filings required due to fiduciary
holdings of the Republic Subsidiaries, none of Republic\'s Subsidiaries is
required to file any forms, reports, or other documents with the SEC.  (b)
Each of the Republic Financial Statements (including, in each case,
any related notes) contained in the Republic SEC Reports, including
any Republic SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, complied or will comply as to form in all Material
respects with the applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, was prepared or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes to such financial statements, or, in the case
of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and
fairly presented or will fairly present the consolidated financial position
of Republic and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates and
the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements
were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which were
not or will not be Material in amount or effect.  5.6 ABSENCE OF
UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. No Republic Company has any Liabilities that are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Republic, except Liabilities which are accrued or reserved
against in the consolidated balance sheets of Republic as of June 30, 2000 or
included in the Republic Financial Statements filed after such date but
before the date of this Agreement (or reflected in the notes thereto),
Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business subsequent to June
30, 2000, Liabilities to be incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Termination Fee Agreement (in each case
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Termination Fee

Memorandum. No Republic Company has incurred or paid any Liability since
December 31, 1999, except for such Liabilities incurred or paid in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past business practices and which
are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Republic.  5.7 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR
EVENTS. Since December 31, 1999, except as disclosed in the Republic
Financial Statements delivered prior to the date of this Agreement or as
otherwise disclosed in the Republic Disclosure Memorandum, there have been no

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Republic.  5.8 TAX MATTERS. Except as set forth in Section 5.8 of
the Republic Disclosure Memorandum:  (a) Since December 31, 1994, all
Material Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of any of the
Republic Companies have been timely filed, or requests for extensions have

accurate in all Material respects. All Tax Returns for periods ending on or
before the date of the most recent fiscal year end immediately preceding the
Effective Time will be timely filed or requests for extensions will be timely
filed. All Taxes shown on filed Tax Returns have been paid. There is no audit
examination, deficiency, or refund Litigation with respect to any Taxes, that
is reasonably likely to result in a determination that would
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Republic, except to the extent reserved against in the Republic Financial
Statements dated prior to the date of this Agreement. All Material Taxes and
other Material Liabilities due with respect to completed and settled
examinations or concluded Litigation have been paid.  (b) None of the
Republic Companies has executed an extension or waiver of any statute of
limitations on the assessment or collection of any Tax due (excluding such
statutes that relate to years currently under examination by the Internal
Revenue Service or other applicable taxing authorities) that is currently in

for any of the Republic Companies for the period or periods through and
including the date of the respective Republic Financial Statements has been
made and is reflected on such Republic Financial Statements.  (d) Each of
the Republic Companies is in Material compliance with, and its records
contain the information and documents (including properly completed IRS Forms
W-9) necessary to comply with, in all material respects, applicable

and local Tax Laws, and such records identify with specificity all accounts
subject to backup withholding under Section 3406 of the Internal Revenue
Code.  (e) None of the Republic Companies has made any payments, is

been an ownership change, as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 382(g),
of the Republic Companies (other than with respect to Republic Companies
acquired directly or indirectly by Republic) that occurred during or after
any Taxable Period in which such Republic Companies incurred a net operating
loss that carries over to any Taxable Period ending after December 31,
1999.  (h) No Republic Company has filed any consent under Section 341(f) of
the Internal Revenue Code concerning collapsible corporations.  (i) No
Republic Company has or has had a permanent establishment in any foreign
country, as defined in any applicable tax treaty or convention between the
United States and such foreign country, including any operation for which a
provision in any applicable tax treaty or convention between the United
States and such foreign country corresponding to the provision on permanent
establishments in the U.S. Model Income Tax Treaty applies to such
operation.  5.9 ASSETS. Except as set forth in Section 5.9 of the Republic
Disclosure Memorandum, the Republic Companies have good and marketable title,
free and clear of all Liens, to all of their respective Assets other than
such defects and liens which are not reasonably likely, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Republic. All
tangible properties used in the businesses of the Republic Companies are in
good condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and are usable in
the ordinary course of business consistent with Republic\'s past practices.
All Assets which are Material to Republic\'s business on a consolidated
basis, held under leases or subleases by any of the Republic Companies, are
held under valid Contracts enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and except that the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or injunctive
relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceedings
may be brought), and each such Contract is in full force and effect. The
Republic Companies currently maintain insurance (that is in full force and
effect) in amounts, scope and coverage reasonably necessary for their
operations. Except as set forth in Section 5.9 of the Republic Disclosure
Memorandum, none of the Republic Companies has received notice from any
insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that
coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs
with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially
increased. Except as set forth in Section 5.9 of the Republic Disclosure
Memorandum, there are no claims pending under such policies of insurance and
no notices have been given by any Republic Company under such policies. No
Republic Company is in Material Default under such policies of insurance. The
Assets of the Republic Companies include all Material Assets required to
operate the business of the Republic Companies as presently
conducted.  5.10 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed in Section 5.10
of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum:  (a) Each Republic Company, its
Participation Facilities, and, to the Knowledge of Republic, its Loan
Properties are, and have been, in compliance with all Environmental Laws,
except those instances of non-compliance which are not reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Republic.  (b) There is no Litigation pending or, to the Knowledge of
Republic, threatened before any court, governmental agency, or authority, or
other forum in which any Republic Company or any of its Participation
Facilities has been or, with respect to threatened Litigation, may reasonably
be expected to be named as a defendant (i) for alleged
noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with any Environmental Law or
(ii) relating to the release into the environment of any Hazardous Material,
whether or not occurring at, on, under, or involving a site owned, leased, or
operated by any Republic Company or any of its Participation Facilities,
except for such Litigation pending or threatened that is not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Republic.  (c) There is no Litigation pending, or to the Knowledge of
Republic, threatened before any court, governmental agency, or board, or
other forum in which any of its Loan Properties (or Republic in respect of
such Loan Property) has been or, with respect to threatened Litigation,
may reasonably be expected to be named as a defendant or
potentially responsible party (i) for alleged noncompliance (including by
any predecessor) with any Environmental Law or (ii) relating to the
release into the environment of any Hazardous Material, whether or not
occurring at, on, under, or involving a Loan Property, except for such
Litigation pending or threatened that is not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Republic.  (d) To the Knowledge of Republic, there is no reasonable basis
for any Litigation of a type described in subsections (b) or (c), except such
as is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Republic.  (e) To the Knowledge of Republic,
during the period of (i) any Republic Company\'s ownership or operation of
any of their respective current properties, (ii) any Republic Company\'s
participation in the management of any Participation Facility, or (iii) any
Republic Company\'s holding of a security interest in a Loan Property, there
have been no releases of Hazardous Material in, on, under, or affecting (or
potentially affecting) such properties, except such as are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Republic. Prior to the period of (i) any Republic Company\'s ownership or
operation of any of their respective current properties, (ii) any Republic
Company\'s participation in the management of any Participation Facility, or
(iii) any Republic Company\'s holding of a security interest in a Loan

Material in, on, under, or affecting any such property, Participation
Facility, or Loan Property, except such as are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Republic.  5.11 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Republic is duly registered as a bank
holding company under the BHC Act. Each Republic Company has in effect all
Permits necessary for it to own, lease, or operate its Material Assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted, except for those Permits the absence
of which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic, and there has occurred no
Default under any such Permit, other than Defaults which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Republic. None of the Republic Companies:  (a) is in violation of any
Laws, Orders, or Permits applicable to its business or employees conducting
its business, except for violations which are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic;
and  (b) has received any notification or communication from any agency
or department of federal, state, or local government or any
Regulatory Authority or the staff thereof (i) asserting that any Republic
Company is not in compliance with any of the Laws or Orders which such
governmental authority or Regulatory Authority enforces, where such
noncompliance is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Republic, (ii) threatening to revoke any
Permits, the revocation of which is reasonably likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic, or (iii)
requiring any Republic Company (x) to enter into or consent to the issuance
of a cease and desist order, formal agreement, directive, commitment, or
memorandum of understanding, or (y) to adopt any Board resolution or similar
undertaking, which restricts materially the conduct of its business, or in
any Material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit or reserve
policies, its management, or the payment of dividends (and no Republic
Company has entered into, consented to or adopted any of the preceding). To
Republic\'s Knowledge, no grounds for any of the foregoing in this Section
5.11(b) exist.  5.12 LABOR RELATIONS. No Republic Company is the subject of
any Litigation asserting that it or any other Republic Company has committed
an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
Act or comparable state Law) or seeking to compel it or any other Republic
Company to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions
of employment, nor is any Republic Company a party to or bound by
any collective bargaining agreement, Contract, or other agreement
or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is there
any strike or other labor dispute involving any Republic Company, pending
or, to the Knowledge of Republic, threatened, or to the Knowledge of
Republic, is there any activity involving any Republic Company\'s employees
seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in any other
organization activity.  5.13 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.  (a) Republic has
disclosed in Section 5.13 of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum, and has
delivered or made available to Buyer prior to the execution of this Agreement
correct and complete copies in each case of, all Republic Benefit Plans,
including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and insurance contracts
forming a part of any Republic Benefit Plans and all amendments thereto. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Republic Benefit Plans" means all pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, employee
stock ownership, severance pay, vacation, bonus, or other compensation or
incentive plan, all other employee programs or agreements, all medical,
vision, dental, or other health plans, all life insurance plans, and all
other employee benefit plans or fringe benefit plans, including "employee
benefit plans" as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA maintained
by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by, any Republic
Company for the benefit of employees, retirees, dependents, spouses,
directors, independent contractors, or other beneficiaries and under which
employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors,
or other beneficiaries are eligible to participate. Any of the Republic
Benefit Plans which is an "employee welfare benefit plan," as that term is
defined in Section 3(l) of ERISA, or an "employee pension benefit plan," as
that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, is referred to herein as
a "Republic ERISA Plan." Any Republic ERISA Plan which is also subject
to Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA
is referred to herein as a "Republic Pension Plan." Neither Republic nor
any Republic Company has an "obligation to contribute" (as defined in
ERISA Section 4212) to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA
Sections 4001(a)(3) and 3(37)(A)). Each "employee pension benefit plan," as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, ever maintained by any Republic Company,
that was intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code is disclosed as such in Section 5.13 of the Republic Disclosure
Memorandum.  (b) Republic has delivered or made available to Buyer prior to
the execution of this Agreement correct and complete copies of the
following documents: (i) all trust agreements or other funding arrangements
for such Republic Benefit Plans (including insurance contracts), and all
amendments thereto, (ii) with respect to any such Republic Benefit Plans
or amendments, all determination letters, Material rulings, Material
opinion letters, Material information letters, or Material advisory opinions
issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of
Labor, or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation after December 31, 1994,
(iii) annual reports or returns, audited or unaudited financial
statements, actuarial valuations and reports, and summary annual reports
prepared for any Republic Benefit Plan with respect to the most recent plan
year and (iv) the most recent summary plan descriptions and any
Material modifications thereto.  (c) All Republic Benefit Plans are in
compliance with the applicable terms of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, and
any other applicable Laws, other than instances of noncompliance which are
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Republic. Each Republic ERISA Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and
Republic is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of
any such favorable determination letter or the loss of qualification of such
Republic Benefit Plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Each
trust created under any Republic ERISA Plan has been determined to be exempt
from Tax under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and Republic is
not aware of any circumstance which will or could reasonably result in
revocation of such exemption. With respect to each Republic Benefit Plan to
the Knowledge of Republic, no event has occurred which will or could
reasonably give rise to a loss of any intended Tax consequences under the
Internal Revenue Code or to any Tax under Section 511 of the Internal Revenue
Code that is reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Republic. There is no Material pending or, to
the Knowledge of Republic, threatened Litigation relating to any Republic
ERISA Plan.  (d) No Republic Company has engaged in a transaction with
respect to any Republic Benefit Plan that, assuming the Taxable Period of
such transaction expired as of the date of this Agreement, would subject any
Republic Company to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
Internal Revenue Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in amounts which are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Republic. Neither Republic nor, any administrator or
fiduciary of any Republic Benefit Plan (or any agent of any of the foregoing)
has engaged in any transaction, or acted or failed to act in any manner with
respect to any Republic Benefit Plan which could subject Republic to any
direct or indirect Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any
fiduciary, co-fiduciary, or other duty under ERISA, where such Liability,
individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Republic. No oral or written representation or
communication with respect to any aspect of the Republic Benefit Plans has
been made to employees of any Republic Company which is not in conformity
with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of such plans,
where any Liability resulting from such non-conformity is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Republic. Each Republic ERISA Plan
which is intended to be part of a voluntary employees\' beneficiary
association within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue
Code has (i) received an opinion letter from the Internal Revenue
Service recognizing its exempt status under Section 501(c)(9) of the
Internal Revenue Code and (ii) filed a timely notice with the Internal
Revenue Service pursuant to Section 505(c) of the Internal Revenue Code,
and Republic is not aware of circumstances likely to result in the loss of
the exempt status of such Republic ERISA Plan under Section 501(c)(9) of
the Internal Revenue Code.  (e) No Republic Pension Plan has any "unfunded
current liability," as that term is defined in Section 302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA,
and the fair market value of the Assets of any such plan exceeds the plan\'s
"benefit liabilities," as that term is defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of
ERISA, when determined under actuarial factors that would apply if the plan
terminated in accordance with all applicable legal requirements. Since the
date of the most recent actuarial valuation, there has been (i) no Material
change in the financial position or funded status of any Republic Pension
Plan, (ii) no change in the actuarial assumptions with respect to any
Republic Pension Plan, and (iii) no increase in benefits under any Republic
Pension Plan as a result of plan amendments or changes in applicable Law, any
of which is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Republic. Neither any Republic Pension Plan nor
any "single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of
ERISA, currently maintained by any Republic Company, or the single-employer
plan of any entity which is considered one employer with Republic under
Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section
302 of ERISA (whether or not waived) (a "Republic ERISA Affiliate") has an
"accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no Republic ERISA Affiliate
has an outstanding funding waiver. All required contributions with respect to
an Republic Pension Plan or any single-employer plan of an Republic
ERISA Affiliate have been timely made and there is no lien or expected to be
a lien under Internal Revenue Code Section 412(n) or ERISA Section 302(f)
or Tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 4971. No Republic Company
has provided, or is required to provide, security to an Republic Pension
Plan or to any single-employer plan of an Republic ERISA Affiliate pursuant
to Section 401(a)(29) of the Internal Revenue Code. All premiums required
to be paid under ERISA Section 4006 have been timely paid by Republic,
except to the extent any failure to timely pay would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Republic.  (f) No Liability under Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by any Republic Company with respect to
any defined benefit plan currently or formerly maintained by any of them or
by any Republic ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full (other
than Liability for Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, which have
been paid when due, except for Liabilities that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Republic). Except as
set forth in Section 5.13 of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum, no notice of
a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived or extended,
other than pursuant to PBGC Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be
filed for any Republic Pension Plan or any Republic ERISA Affiliate within
the 12-month period ending on the date hereof.  (g) Except as set forth in
Section 5.13 of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum, no Republic Company has
any obligations for retiree health and retiree life benefits under any of the
Republic Benefit Plans other than with respect to benefit coverage mandated
by applicable Law. Except as set forth in Section 5.13 of the Republic
Disclosure Memorandum, the Republic Companies may amend or terminate such
Republic Benefit Plans without incurring any liability thereunder.  (h)
Except as set forth in Section 5.13 of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum,
there has been no amendment to, announcement by Republic or any Republic
Company relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage under,
any Republic Benefit Plan that would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such Republic Benefit Plan above the level of expense incurred
therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Except as disclosed in Section 5.13
of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum, neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(1) entitle any employees of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries to severance
pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of employment prior
to or after the date hereof, (2) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any
other material obligation pursuant to, any of the Republic Benefit Plans, (3)
cause Republic to record additional compensation expense on its income
statement with respect to any stock option or other equity award, or (4)
result in any payments under any of the Republic Benefit Plans which would
not be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code.  (i) The aggregate dollar amount to be paid immediately prior
to the Effective Time pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2, 6 and 7 of Section 7.2(b)
of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum will not exceed $20 million
(excluding the cost of any continuing obligations and excluding any payments
resulting from compensating any officer or director of Republic for any
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code or any
interest or penalties that are incurred with respect to such excise
tax).  5.14 MATERIAL CONTRACTS. Except as set forth in the Republic
Disclosure Memorandum and except for Contracts filed as exhibits to
Republic\'s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 (or as an
exhibit to another Republic SEC Report filed before the date of this
Agreement and which Contract has been identified to Buyer), as of the date of
this Agreement, none of the Republic Companies, nor any of their
respective Assets, businesses, or operations, is a party to, or is bound or
affected by, or receives benefits under, (i) any employment, severance,
termination, consulting, or retirement Contract providing for aggregate
payments to any Person in any calendar year in excess of $75,000, (ii) any
Contract relating to the borrowing of money by any Republic Company or the
guarantee by any Republic Company of any such obligation (other than
Contracts evidencing deposit liabilities, purchases of federal funds, fully-
secured repurchase agreements, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances of
depository institution Subsidiaries, trade payables, and Contracts relating
to borrowings or guarantees made in the ordinary course of business),
(iii) any exclusive dealing Contract or other Contract that materially limits
the ability of any Republic Company to compete in any line of business or
with any Person or in any area or that would so limit its ability (or
the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates) after
the Effective Time and (iv) any other Contract or amendment thereto that is
a "material contract" within the meaning of Item 601(b)(10) of the
SEC\'s regulation S-K (together with all Contracts referred to in Sections
5.9 and 5.13(a) of this Agreement, the "Republic Contracts"). With respect to
each Republic Contract: (i) the Contract is in full force and effect; (ii)
no Republic Company is in Default thereunder, other than Defaults which
are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Republic; (iii) no Republic Company has repudiated
or waived any Material provision of any such Contract; and (iv) no other
party to any such Contract is, to the Knowledge of Republic, in Default in
any Material respect, other than Defaults which are not reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Republic, or has repudiated or waived any Material provision
thereunder. Except for Federal Home Loan Bank advances or as set forth in
Section 5.14 of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum, all of the indebtedness
of any Republic Company for money borrowed is repayable at any time by
such Republic Company without penalty or premium.  5.15 LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.  (a) There is no Litigation instituted or pending, or, to the
Knowledge of Republic, threatened against any Republic Company, or against
any Asset, interest, or right of any of them, that is reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Republic, nor are there any Orders of any Regulatory Authorities, other
governmental authorities, or arbitrators outstanding against any Republic
Company, that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic.  (b) Section 5.15(b) of
the Republic Disclosure Memorandum includes a summary report of all
Litigation as of the date of this Agreement to which any Republic Company is
a party and which names a Republic Company as a defendant or cross-
defendant.  5.16 REPORTS. Since December 31, 1996, or the date of
organization if later, each Republic Company has timely filed all reports and
statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, that it was required to file with any Regulatory Authorities, except
failures to file which are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Republic. As of their
respective dates, each of such reports and documents, including the
financial statements, exhibits, and schedules thereto, complied in all
Material respects with all applicable Laws.  5.17 STATEMENTS TRUE AND
CORRECT. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by any Republic
Company or any Affiliate thereof regarding Republic or such Affiliate for
inclusion in the Registration Statement to be filed by Buyer with the SEC
will, when the Registration Statement becomes effective, contain any untrue
statement of a Material fact, or omit to state any Material fact required to
be stated thereunder or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
information supplied or to be supplied by any Republic Company or any
Affiliate thereof for inclusion in the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
Republic\'s stockholders in connection with the Stockholders\' Meeting will,

in all Material respects with the provisions of applicable Law.  5.18 TAX
AND REGULATORY MATTERS. No Republic Company or any Affiliate thereof has
taken or agreed to take any action, and as of the date hereof Republic has no
Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably likely to (i)
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or (ii) materially impede or
delay receipt of any Consents of Regulatory Authorities referred to in
Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of
Republic there exists no fact, circumstance, or reason why the requisite
Consents referred to in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement cannot be received
in a timely manner.  5.19 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. All of the Intellectual
Property rights of Republic and the Republic Subsidiaries are in full force
and effect and, if applicable, constitute legal, valid, and binding
obligations of the respective parties thereto, and there have not been, and,
to the Knowledge of Republic, there currently are not, any Defaults
thereunder by Republic or a Republic Subsidiary, where such Default is
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Republic. Republic or a Republic Subsidiary owns or is the
valid licensee of all such Intellectual Property rights free and clear of all
Liens or claims of infringement. Neither Republic nor any of the Republic
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Republic, their respective predecessors
has infringed the Intellectual Property rights of others and, to the
Knowledge of Republic, none of the Intellectual Property rights as used in

asserted a claim of such infringement. Except as disclosed in Section 5.19 of
the Republic Disclosure Memorandum, neither Republic nor the Republic
Subsidiaries is obligated to pay any royalties to any Person with respect to
any such Intellectual Property. Republic or a Republic Subsidiary owns or has
the valid right to use all of the Intellectual Property rights which it
is presently using, or in connection with performance of any material
Contract to which it is a party. No officer, director, or employee of
Republic or the Republic Subsidiaries is party to any Contract which requires
such officer, director, or employee to assign any interest in any
Intellectual Property or keep confidential any trade secrets, proprietary
data, customer information, or other business information or, except as
disclosed in Section 5.19 of the Republic Disclosure Memorandum, which
restricts or prohibits such officer, director, or employee from engaging in
activities competitive with any Person, including Republic or any of the
Republic Subsidiaries.  5.20 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. Each Republic Company has
taken all necessary action to exempt the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Termination Fee Agreement from any applicable "moratorium,"
"control share," "fair price," "business combination," or other anti-takeover

including Sections 607.0901 and 607.0902 of the FBCA.  5.21 CHARTER
PROVISIONS. Each Republic Company has taken all action so that the entering

governing instruments of any Republic Company or restrict or impair the
ability of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to exercise
the rights of a stockholder with respect to, shares of any Republic Company
that may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by it.  5.22
RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Republic has taken all necessary action (including, if
required, redeeming all of the outstanding stock purchase rights or amending
or terminating the Republic Rights Agreement) so that the entering into of
this Agreement and the Termination Fee Agreement, and consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not and
will not result in any Person becoming able to exercise any stock purchase
rights under the Republic Rights Agreement or enabling or requiring the stock
purchase rights to be separated from the shares of Republic Common Stock to
which they are attached or to be triggered or to become exercisable. Republic
has approved the amendment to the Republic Rights Agreement substantially in
the form of Exhibit 2 hereto.  5.23 DERIVATIVES. All interest rate swaps,
caps, floors, option agreements, futures and forward contracts, and other

Agreement, to the effect that, in the opinion of such firm, the Exchange
Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of

Buyer.  5.26 REPUBLIC INDENTURE. No "Default" or "Event of Default"

noncompliance is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer, (ii) threatening to revoke any Permits,

Stockholders\' Meeting. All documents that any Buyer Company or any Affiliate
thereof is responsible for filing with any Regulatory Authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby will comply as to form in all
Material respects with the provisions of applicable Law.  6.10 TAX AND
REGULATORY MATTERS. No Buyer Company or any Affiliate thereof has taken or
agreed to take any action, and as of the date hereof Buyer has no Knowledge

efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the
1933 Act as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof, and Buyer shall
use its reasonable efforts to take any action required to be taken under the
applicable state Blue Sky or securities Laws in connection with the issuance
of the shares of Buyer Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger. Republic
shall furnish all information concerning it, its directors and officers and
the holders of its capital stock as Buyer may reasonably request for
inclusion in the Registration Statement. Republic shall call and cause to be
convened a Stockholders\' Meeting, to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the
SEC, for the purpose of voting upon approval of this Agreement and such other
related matters as it deems appropriate. In connection with the
Stockholders\' Meeting, (i) the Board of Directors of Republic shall
recommend to its stockholders the approval of the matters submitted for
approval, and (ii) the Board of Directors and officers of Republic shall use
their reasonable efforts to obtain such stockholders\' approval, provided
that Republic may withdraw, modify, or change in an adverse manner to Buyer
its recommendations if the Board of Directors of Republic, after having
consulted with and based upon the advice of outside counsel, determines in
good faith that the failure to so withdraw, modify, or change its
recommendation could reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties
of Republic\'s Board of Directors under applicable Law. In addition, nothing
in this Section 8.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall (i) prohibit
accurate disclosure by Republic of information that is required to be
disclosed in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement or in any
other document required to be filed with the SEC (including, without
limitation, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9) or
otherwise required to be publicly disclosed by applicable Law or regulations
or rules of the NASD or (ii) relieve Republic from its obligation to call and
convene the Stockholders\' Meeting. Each of Buyer and Republic further agrees
that if it shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of any information
furnished by it that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement
to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take the
necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement.  8.2 APPLICATIONS. Buyer
and Republic and their respective Subsidiaries shall promptly prepare and
file, and cooperate with each other in the preparation and, where
appropriate, filing of, applications with all Regulatory Authorities having
jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated by this Agreement seeking the
requisite Consents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each Party will have the right to review in advance, and to
the extent practicable each will consult with each other, subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all
written information submitted to all Regulatory Authorities, and will provide
the other with copies of written communications received by it from any
Regulatory Authorities, in each case with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby.  8.3 FILINGS WITH STATE OFFICES. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall cause Newco to
execute and file the North Carolina Articles of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of North Carolina and the Florida Articles of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Florida in connection with the
Closing.  8.4 AGREEMENT AS TO EFFORTS TO CONSUMMATE. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use, and to cause
its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective,
as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, (i) using its reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any Order
adversely affecting its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
herein and to cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to in Article 9
of this Agreement and (ii) if necessary, the filing of any amendments
or supplements to the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement or
a resolicitation of proxies as a consequence of an acquisition or
business combination of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, that
nothing herein shall preclude either Party from exercising its rights under
this Agreement. Each Party shall use, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents necessary
or desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each Party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application by or on
behalf of such other Party with respect to any such Consent.  8.5
INVESTIGATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY.  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, each
Party shall keep the other Party advised of all Material developments
relevant to its business and to consummation of the Merger and shall permit
the other Party to make or cause to be made such investigation of the
business and properties of it and its Subsidiaries and of their respective
financial and legal conditions as the other Party reasonably requests,
provided that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily with
normal operations. No investigation by a Party shall affect the
representations and warranties of the other Party.  (b) Each Party shall,
and shall cause its advisers and agents to, maintain the confidentiality of
all confidential information furnished to it by the other Party concerning
its and its Subsidiaries\' businesses, operations, and financial positions to
the extent required by, and in accordance with, confidentiality agreements
between the Parties, and shall not use such information for any purpose
except in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall
promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and copies
thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information received
from the other Party.  (c) Each Party agrees to give the other Party notice
as soon as practicable after any determination by it of any fact or
occurrence relating to the other Party which it has discovered through the
course of its investigation and which represents, or is reasonably likely to
represent, either a Material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement of the other Party or which has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the other Party; provided,
however, that the giving of such notice shall not be dispositive of the
occurrence of such breach or a Material Adverse Effect.  (d) Neither Party
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate
or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client or
similar privilege with respect to such information or contravene any Law,
Order or Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Parties will use their reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable, in circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 8.6 PRESS RELEASES. Prior
to the Effective Time, Buyer and Republic shall consult with each other as to
the form and substance of any press release materially related to this
Agreement or any other transaction contemplated hereby; provided, that
nothing in this Section 8.6 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making
any disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order to
satisfy such Party\'s disclosure obligations imposed by Law or by the rules
of the New York Stock Exchange.  8.7 CERTAIN ACTIONS. Except with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, no Republic Company
nor any Affiliate thereof nor any Representative thereof retained by any
Republic Company shall, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage
or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any
inquiries or the making of any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Republic and its Board of Directors shall be
permitted (i) to the extent applicable, to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) to engage in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, if and only to the extent that (a)
Republic\'s Board of Directors concludes in good faith and consistent with
its fiduciary duties to Republic\'s stockholders under applicable Law that
such Acquisition Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, (b) prior to providing any information or data to any
Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such Person,
Republic\'s Board of Directors receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as stringent as those
contained in the Republic Confidentiality Agreement, and (c) prior to
providing any information or data to any Person or entering into discussions
or negotiations with any Person, Republic\'s Board of Directors notifies
Buyer promptly of such inquiries, proposals, or offers received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with, any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers. Republic agrees that it
will, and will cause its officers, directors and Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions,
or negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Republic agrees that it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform
its directors, officers, key employees, agents, and Representatives of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 8.7. Nothing in this Section
8.7 shall (i) permit Republic to terminate this Agreement (except
as specifically provided in Article 10 of this Agreement) or (ii) affect
any other obligation of Buyer or Republic under this Agreement.  8.8 TAX
TREATMENT. Each of the Parties undertakes and agrees to use its reasonable
efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action which would cause the
Merger not, to qualify for treatment as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax
purposes.  8.9 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS. Each Republic Company shall take all
necessary steps to exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
from, and if necessary, the Parties shall challenge the validity or
applicability of, any applicable Takeover Laws.  8.10 CHARTER PROVISIONS.
Each Republic Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that the
entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the
grant of any rights to any Person under the Articles of Incorporation,
Bylaws, or other governing instruments of any Republic Company or restrict or
impair the ability of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise
to exercise the rights of a stockholder with respect to, shares of any
Republic Company that may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by
it.  8.11 RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Republic shall take all necessary action
(including, if required, redeeming all of the outstanding stock purchase
rights or amending or terminating the Republic Rights Agreement) so that the
entering into of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in any
Person becoming able to exercise any stock purchase rights under the
Republic Rights Agreement or enabling or requiring the stock purchase rights
to be separated from the shares of Republic Common Stock to which they
are attached or to be triggered or to become exercisable. Republic shall
use all reasonable efforts to enter into an amendment to the Republic
Rights Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof (and in any
event prior to the Effective Time) in substantially the form of Exhibit
2.  8.12 AGREEMENT OF AFFILIATES. Republic has disclosed in Section 8.12 of
the Republic Disclosure Memorandum each Person whom it reasonably believes
may be deemed an "affiliate" of Republic for purposes of Rule 145 under
the 1933 Act. Republic shall use its reasonable efforts to cause each
Person who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Republic for purposes of
Rule 145 under the 1933 Act as of the date of the Stockholders\' Meeting to
deliver to Buyer not later than the Effective Time, a written agreement,
in substantially the form of Exhibit 3, providing that such Person will
not sell, pledge, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of
Republic Common Stock held by such Person except as contemplated by such
agreement or by this Agreement and will not sell, pledge, transfer, or
otherwise dispose of the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be received by such
Person upon consummation of the Merger except in compliance with
applicable provisions of the 1933 Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Shares of Buyer Common Stock issued to such affiliates of
Republic in exchange for shares of Republic Common Stock shall not be
transferable, regardless of whether each such affiliate has provided the
written agreement referred to in this Section 8.12 (and Buyer shall be
entitled to place restrictive legends upon certificates for shares of Buyer
Common Stock issued to affiliates of Republic pursuant to this Agreement to
enforce the provisions of this Section 8.12), except as provided herein.
Buyer shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement under the 1933 Act for the purposes of resale of Buyer Common Stock
by such affiliates.  8.13 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND CONTRACTS. Following the
Effective Time, Buyer shall provide generally to officers and employees of
the Republic Companies, who at or after the Effective Time become employees
of a Buyer Company ("Continuing Employees"), employee benefits under employee
benefit plans (other than stock option or other plans involving the
potential issuance of Buyer Common Stock except as set forth in this Section
8.13), on terms and conditions which when taken as a whole are
substantially similar to those currently provided by the Buyer Companies to
their similarly situated officers and employees. For purposes of
participation and vesting (but not accrual of benefits) under such employee
benefit plans, (i) service under any qualified defined benefit plans of
any Republic Company or any of its predecessors shall be treated as
service under Buyer\'s qualified defined benefit plans, (ii) service under
any qualified defined contribution plans of any Republic Company or any of
its predecessors shall be treated as service under Buyer\'s qualified
defined contribution plans, and (iii) service under any other employee
benefit plans of any Republic Company or any of its predecessors shall be
treated as service under any similar employee benefit plans maintained by
Buyer. Buyer shall cause the Buyer welfare benefit plans that cover the
Continuing Employees after the Effective Time to (i) waive any waiting period
and restrictions and limitations for preexisting conditions or
insurability (except for pre-existing conditions that were excluded under
Republic\'s welfare benefit plans), and (ii) cause any deductible, co-
insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by the Continuing Employees
under Republic\'s welfare benefit plans to be credited to such
Continuing Employees under the Buyer welfare benefit plans, so as to reduce
the amount of any deductible, co-insurance, or maximum out-of-pocket payments
payable by the Continuing Employees under the Buyer welfare benefit plans.
The continued coverage of the Continuing Employees under the employee
benefits plans maintained by Republic and/or any Republic Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time during a transition period shall be
deemed to provide the Continuing Employees with benefits that are no less
favorable than those offered to other employees of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, provided that after the Effective Time there is no Material
reduction (determined on an overall basis) in the benefits provided under
the Republic employee benefit plans. Buyer shall and shall cause Republic
and its Subsidiaries to honor all employment, severance, consulting, and
other compensation Contracts disclosed in Sections 7.2 or 8.13 of the
Republic Disclosure Memorandum to Buyer between any Republic Company and any
current or former director, officer, or employee thereof, and all provisions
for vested benefits or other vested amounts earned or accrued through
the Effective Time under the Republic Benefit Plans. Except as
expressly provided in this Section 8.13, nothing contained herein shall in
any way limit or restrict the ability of Buyer to amend, modify, or terminate
any employee benefit plan, including any Republic Benefit Plan, following
the Effective Time. Buyer shall be responsible for the fees related to
the termination of the Republic Benefit Plans.  8.14
INDEMNIFICATION.  (a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period of
six years thereafter, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
present directors and officers of the Republic Companies (each, an
"Indemnified Party") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent that
Republic is permitted to indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors
and officers under the laws of the State of Florida, the Republic\'s Articles
of Incorporation and Republic\'s Bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof; provided that any determination required to be made with respect to
whether an officer\'s or director\'s conduct complies with the standards set
forth under Florida law, such Articles of Incorporation and such Bylaws shall
be made by independent counsel (which shall not be counsel that
provides material services to Buyer) selected by Buyer and reasonably
acceptable to such officer or director; and provided, further, that in the
absence of applicable Florida judicial precedent to the contrary, such
counsel, in making such determination, shall presume such officer\'s or
director\'s conduct complied with such standard and Buyer shall have the
burden to demonstrate that such officer\'s or director\'s conduct failed to
comply with such standard. All rights to indemnification in respect of any
claim assertion or made within the six-year period referred to above
shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.  (b) For a period
of three years from the Effective Time, Buyer shall use its reasonable
efforts to provide that portion of director\'s and officer\'s liability
insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of Republic or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Effective Time) (as opposed to Republic) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Time, which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that
coverage currently provided by Republic; provided, however, that in no event
shall Buyer be required to expend more than 150 percent of the current amount
expended by Republic (the "Insurance Amount") to maintain or procure such
directors and officers insurance coverage; provided, further, that if Buyer
is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section
8.14(b), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount; provided,
further, that officers and directors of Republic or any Subsidiary may be
required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to Buyer\'s insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such
insurance.  (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
Section 8.14(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation described above, shall promptly notify Buyer
thereof; provided that the failure so to notify shall not affect the
obligations of Buyer under Section 8.14(a) unless and to the extent that
Buyer is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.  (d) If Buyer or
any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its
Assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 8.14.  (e) The provisions of this Section 8.14 are
intended to be for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and representatives.  8.15 EXEMPTION
FROM LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 16(B). If Republic delivers to Buyer in a timely
fashion prior to the Effective Time accurate information regarding those
officers and directors of Republic subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act (the "Republic Insiders"), the number of shares
of Republic Common Stock held or to be held by each such Republic Insider
expected to be exchanged for the Buyer Common Stock in the Merger, and the
number and description of the options to purchase shares of Republic Common
Stock held by each such Republic Insider and expected to be converted into
options to purchase the Buyer Common Stock in the Merger, the Board of
Directors of Buyer, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such
term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the 1934 Act), shall
reasonably promptly thereafter, and in any event prior to the Effective Time,
adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by the Republic Insiders of the
Buyer Common Stock in exchange for shares of Republic Common Stock, and of
options to purchase shares of the Buyer Corporation Common Stock upon
conversion of options to purchase Republic Common Stock, in each case
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent
such securities are listed in the information provided by Republic, are
approved by such Board of Directors or by such committee thereof, and are
intended to be exempt from Liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the 1934
Act, such that any such receipt shall be so exempt. Republic shall take all
such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by
Section 3.5 and any other dispositions of Republic equity securities
(including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of Republic to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.  8.16 ASSUMPTION OF REPUBLIC
DEBENTURES. Newco agrees to assume all obligations under the Indenture,
including executing any supplemental indenture thereto.  8.17 ACCOUNTANTS\'
LETTERS. Republic shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered
to Buyer, and to Buyer\'s directors and officers who sign the Registration
Statement, a letter of Ernst and Young LLP independent auditors with respect to
Republic, dated (i) the date on which the Registration Statement shall become
effective and (ii) a date shortly prior to the Effective Time, and addressed
to Buyer, and such directors and officers, in form and substance customary
for "comfort" letters delivered by independent accountants in accordance with
Statement of Accounting Standards No. 72.  8.18 CERTAIN POLICIES. Prior to
the Effective Time, Republic shall, consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles and on a basis mutually satisfactory to it and Buyer,
modify and change its loan, litigation and real estate valuation policies and
practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be
applied on a basis that is consistent with those of Buyer; provided, however,
that Republic shall not be obligated to take any such action pursuant to this
Section 8.18 unless and until Buyer acknowledges that all conditions to its
obligation to consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived and all
rights to terminate this Agreement have been waived.  8.19 LOCAL ADVISORY
BOARD. From the Effective Time until the earlier of time that (i) the
Subsidiary Combination is consummated or (ii) Buyer otherwise determines to
replace the directors of Republic Security Bank, Buyer shall permit the non-
employee directors of Republic Security Bank as of the date of this Agreement
to continue as directors thereof. From the earlier of (i) and (ii) in the
preceding sentence, Buyer will cause Wachovia Bank, N.A. to create a local
advisory board for Palm Beach, Florida and to appoint to the advisory board
each such non-employee director who is willing to serve. The local advisory
board and each director\'s appointment will continue in accordance with
Wachovia Bank, N.A.\'s customary practices for a minimum period of two years
from the Effective Time. From the Effective Time, each continuing member of
Republic Security Bank\'s Board of directors or of the advisory board shall
receive fees in accordance with Buyer\'s usually and customary practices, but
in no event less than $1,200 annually (with an appropriate reduction in fees
for unattended meetings). Service on the Board of Directors of
Republic Security Bank and the advisory board shall be treated as service
with Buyer for purposes of any Republic Rights outstanding at the Effective
Time under Republic\'s 1991 Director Stock Option Plan, 1993 Director Stock
Option Plan, 1997 Performance Incentive Plan, or the plans of any
company previously acquired by Republic. Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Section 8.19, Buyer shall not be obligated to permit any person
to continue as a director of Republic Security Bank or to serve on
the advisory board unless such director shall have exercised on or prior to
the Effective Time each of the options and warrants that are beneficially
owned by him or her and that would be in-the-money at the Effective
Time.  8.20 AMENDMENT OF INDENTURE. As promptly as practicable after the
date hereof, Republic shall use reasonable efforts to amend the Indenture
in such manner as shall be necessary to permit either Buyer\'s counsel
or Republic\'s counsel to render the opinion contemplated by Section
9.1(g).  8.21 FORMATION OF NEWCO. As soon as practicable following the date
of this Agreement, Buyer shall cause Newco to be duly organized as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Buyer and to become a party to this Agreement by
executing and delivering a supplement hereto.  8.22 DEFEASANCE OF REPUBLIC
SENIOR DEBENTURE. At the request of Buyer, Republic agrees that it will use
all reasonable efforts promptly to take each of the actions contemplated by
Section 11.05 of the Indenture, provided that Republic is not required to
make the deposit contemplated by Section 11.05(a) of the Indenture unless
Buyer has agreed (pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to
Republic) to lend Republic the funds necessary therefor on terms that are
substantially equivalent to the remaining terms of the Senior Debenture
except (1) the use of proceeds would be limited to making the deposit
contemplated by Section 11.05(a) of the Indenture and (2) the loan would need
to be repaid before any change in control of Republic.   ARTICLE 9

Stock), (iii) the tax basis of the Buyer Common Stock received by holders
of Republic Common Stock who exchange all of their Republic Common

interest in Buyer Common Stock for which cash is received), and (iv) the
holding period of the Buyer Common Stock received by holders who exchange all
of their Republic Common Stock solely for Buyer Common Stock in the

Tax Opinion, Buyer Counsel shall be entitled to rely upon representations
of officers of Republic and Buyer reasonably satisfactory in form
