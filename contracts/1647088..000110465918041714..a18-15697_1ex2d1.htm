of the Company or Merger Sub, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded
Stock) shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished and converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Final Merger Consideration (a portion of

Closing to the holder thereof in accordance with _Section 3.5_), without
interest, and the holders of certificates that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented such outstanding Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificated Shares_ ") and the holders of non-certificated shares of Company
Common Stock held by book entry (" _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case,
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to
receive, upon delivery of such Certificated Shares or Uncertificated Shares,
as the case may be, in accordance with _Section 3.5_, the Per Share Final
Merger Consideration (a portion of which, the Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration, shall be payable at the Closing to the holder thereof in
accordance with _Section 3.5_, with the amount in excess thereof to be paid
thereafter in accordance with the terms hereof), without any interest thereon,
for each such Certificated Share or Uncertificated Share, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Paying Agent, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay
to each Holder holding less than 1,000 shares of Company Common Stock, taking
into account shares of Company Common Stock such Holder would have the right
to receive upon the settlement or exercise of Vested Company RSU Awards or

Closing Stock Merger Consideration, an amount in cash equal to the Closing
Stock Merger Consideration such Holder would be entitled to receive
_multiplied by_ $13.35 and rounded down to the nearest penny, and (ii) such
Holders portion of the Closing Warrant Merger Consideration, an amount in
cash equal to the Closing Warrant Merger Consideration such Holder would be
entitled to receive _multiplied by_ the lesser of (A) the value of each Parent
Warrant as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company
and (B) $15.50, rounded down to the nearest penny. For the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to each Holder receiving such cash payment in lieu of such
Holders respective portion of the Closing Stock Merger Consideration and
Closing Warrant Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)_, such
Holder shall not receive any shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Warrants
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the shares of Parent Common Stock
and Parent Warrants that such Holder would have otherwise received in exchange
for such Holders Company Common Stock (including upon the settlement or
exercise of Vested Company RSU Awards or Company Warrants, as applicable)

converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares of
common stock of Merger Sub so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
any change in the number of issued or outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, share
split (including a reverse share split), or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any share dividend or share distribution (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common
Stock) with a record date during such period, the amount of the Per Share
Final Merger Consideration payable as provided in _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change consistent with the adjustment
provisions contained in the Parent Warrant Agreement; _provided_ that, in the
event that the effect of any such adjustment would trigger obligations under
Nasdaqs stockholder approval requirements for the issuance of any additional
shares of Parent Common Stock, that portion of such adjustment that would
result in the Parent Common Stock issuance being equal to or greater than the
20% threshold set by Nasdaq would instead be made in cash (it being understood
that the cash paid in lieu of each share of Parent Common Stock shall be equal
to $13.35). For the avoidance of doubt, the right of Sapphire Holding
S.a.r.l., the minority stockholder of Williams Scotsman Holdings Corp., a
direct subsidiary of Parent (" _Parent Holdco_ "), to exchange at any time all
of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Parent Holdco held by
Sapphire Holding S.a.r.l. for newly issued shares of Parent Common Stock,
subject to the corresponding redemption for no consideration of all issued and
outstanding shares of Class B common stock of Parent, shall not trigger any
adjustment to the Per Share Final Merger Consideration.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Treatment of Company RSU Awards_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or the holders of any securities thereof,
each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall become vested in accordance with its terms, _provided_ that, to the
extent that such Company RSU Award is subject to performance requirements, the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such
Company RSU Award shall become vested shall be determined by the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if applicable, a committee thereof) in good
faith, after notice to Parent, in accordance with the terms of the Company
Equity Plan and the applicable award agreements (each Company RSU Award that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is

 



      
 

 



 

vested prior to the date hereof or becomes so vested at or prior to the
Effective Time, a " _Vested Company RSU Award_ "), and without any further
action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive, without interest, the Per Share Final Merger
Consideration (a portion of which, the Per Share Closing Merger Consideration,
shall be payable at or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing
pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_) (the " _RSU Merger Consideration_ ") in respect
of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company RSU
Award. Each Company RSU Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that does not become vested in accordance with its terms at the
Effective Time shall terminate and become forfeited without the right to
receive any consideration therefor.

 



 

(b) Following the Effective Time, any such cancelled Vested Company RSU Award
shall no longer represent the right to receive shares of Company Common Stock
and shall only entitle the holder of such Vested Company RSU Award to the RSU
Merger Consideration described in _Section 3.2(a)_. The cash portion of the
RSU Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Vested Company RSU Awards
who are employees of the Company pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ shall be paid
through the Surviving Corporations payroll system (which distribution to such
holders shall occur as soon as reasonably practicable but in any event no
later than the first regular payroll date of the Company following the
Effective Time); _provided_ that if the first regular payroll date is less
than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, such distributions
shall occur no later than the second regular payroll date of the Company
following the Effective Time). In the event that the RSU Merger Consideration
is payable to a former employee of the Company, the Surviving Corporation
shall make the payments of the cash portion of the RSU Merger Consideration
due to such former employee in a reasonable manner (such as by check to the
last known address of such former employee in the records of the Surviving
Corporation after a reasonable effort to ascertain the current address of such
former employee). The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the cash portion of the RSU Merger Consideration such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or any other
provision of applicable Tax Law (in accordance with _Section 3.10_) with
respect to the entire amount of the RSU Merger Consideration. The cash portion
of the RSU Merger Consideration payable to a holder of Vested Company RSU
Awards for whom no withholding by the Company is required ( _e.g._ , a
director) in respect of such holders Vested Company RSU Awards, and the non-
cash portion of the RSU Merger Consideration payable to any holder of Vested
Company RSU Awards in respect of such holders Vested Company RSU Awards,
shall be paid directly to such holder by the Paying Agent at such times as
such amounts are otherwise payable to the holders of Company Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.5_.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to effectuate the provisions set forth in this _Section 3.2_; _provided_ ,
that no action taken by the Company shall be required to be irrevocable until
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Company Warrants_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or the
holders of any securities of the Company, each outstanding Company Warrant
shall, without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, expire
unexercised and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect thereof

 



      
 

 



 

under the Warrant Agreement shall cease pursuant to Section 3.01 of the
Warrant Agreement, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. For the avoidance of doubt, following the Effective Time, any such
expired Company Warrant shall no longer be exercisable for shares of Company
Common Stock.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Payment Schedule_. Attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ is a schedule
showing for each Holder: (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock held
by each such Holder, (ii) the estimated number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to each Vested Company RSU Award held by each such Holder and
whether such Holder is an employee of the Company as of the date hereof, (iii)
the estimated percentage of the Closing Cash Merger Consideration, Closing
Stock Merger Consideration and Closing Warrant Merger Consideration payable
with respect thereto and (iv) the estimated percentage of the Escrow Amount
and the Holder Representative Amount attributable with respect thereto. The
Company shall update the schedule set forth on _Exhibit A_ not less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall appoint a United States bank or trust
company or other independent financial institution in the United States (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
paying agent for the Merger and to deliver payment of the consideration
described in _Section 3.1_ (other than the Excluded Stock) and _Section 3.2_
(if applicable). Prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into a paying agent
agreement (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") with the Paying Agent in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, which agreement
shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the Paying
Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent,
(i) for the account and benefit of the former holders of Company Common Stock
and holders of Vested Company RSU Awards for whom no withholding by the
Company is required, an amount of cash (including cash required to pay
dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.6_ and cash in lieu
of any fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock as required pursuant to
_Section 3.7_), and (ii) for the account and benefit of the former holders of
Company Common Stock and holders of Vested Company RSU Awards, evidence of
uncertificated, book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Warrants,
in each case sufficient to deliver payment of the consideration to such
Holders described in _Section 3.1_ (other than the Excluded Stock) and
_Section 3.2_ (if applicable) (such cash, uncertificated, book-entry shares
of Parent Common Stock and Parent Warrants shall be referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Consideration Fund_ "). In the event that the
Consideration Fund shall be insufficient to pay the payments set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall promptly deliver, or cause to be
delivered, additional cash proceeds, uncertificated, book-entry shares of
Parent Common Stock or Parent Warrants (as applicable) to the Paying Agent in
an amount that is equal to the deficiency required to make such payments. The
Paying Agent shall cause the Consideration Fund to be (i) held for the benefit
of the Holders and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to
this _Article III_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Promptly following the execution of the Paying Agent Agreement, and in any
event at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the

 



      
 

 



 

Paying Agent to mail to each Holder, pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement,
whose securities will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Final Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_ (if
payable by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 3.5(a)_) a customary letter
of transmittal reasonably acceptable to the Holder Representative and
instructions to the Letter of Transmittal for use in effecting the surrender
of Uncertificated Shares and Certificated Shares (as applicable) in exchange
for payment of the consideration described in _Section 3.1(a)_ and _Section
3.2(a)_ (if payable by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 3.5(a)_) (a "
_Letter of Transmittal_ "), which shall include such stockholders consent to
_Section 3.9_ and such Holders representations that it is an "accredited
investor" or a "qualified institutional buyer," as applicable, for purposes of
U.S. federal securities Laws; _provided_ that, in the event that such Holder
holds less than 15,000 shares of Company Common Stock (taking into account
shares of Company Common Stock such Holder would have the right to receive
upon the settlement or exercise of Vested Company RSU Awards or Company
Warrants, as applicable) and is unable to make such representations, such
stockholder shall receive in lieu of (i) such Holders portion of the Closing
Stock Merger Consideration, an amount in cash equal to the Closing Stock
Merger Consideration such Holder would be entitled to receive _multiplied by_
$13.35 and rounded down to the nearest penny, and (ii) such Holders portion
of the Closing Warrant Merger Consideration, an amount in cash equal to the
Closing Warrant Merger Consideration such Holder would be entitled to receive
_multiplied by_ the lesser of (A) the value of each Parent Warrant as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company and (B)
$15.50, rounded down to the nearest penny; _provided further_ that (x) any
Holder that holds greater than 15,000 shares of Company Common Stock and is
able to make such representations, but declines to do so, shall not receive
such Holders portion of the Closing Stock Merger Consideration or the Closing
Warrant Merger Consideration and (y) in no event shall Parent be obligated to
make a gross cash payment to such Holders, taken as a whole, pursuant to this
Section 3.5(b) that exceeds $300,000 in the aggregate. For the avoidance of
doubt, with respect to each Holder receiving such cash payment in lieu of such
Holders respective portion of the Closing Stock Merger Consideration and
Closing Warrant Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 3.5(b)_, such
Holders shall not receive any shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Warrants
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the shares of Parent Common Stock
and Parent Warrants that such Holders would have otherwise received in
exchange for such Holders Company Common Stock (including upon the settlement
or exercise of Vested Company RSU Awards or Company Warrants, as applicable)
shall not be issued and shall have the effect of reducing the Closing Stock
Merger Consideration and Closing Warrant Merger Consideration accordingly.

 



 

(c) Upon surrender of Uncertificated Shares or Certificated Shares (as
applicable) and such Letter of Transmittal duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and with such other documents as may
be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the Holder shall be
entitled to receive, in exchange therefor, subject to any required withholding
of Taxes, the consideration described in this _Article III_, and such
Certificated Shares or Uncertificated Shares (as applicable) shall be
cancelled. No interest will be paid to Holders in connection with, or accrued
on, the Per Share Final Merger Consideration. Any stockholder who submits a
Letter of Transmittal in accordance with this Agreement at least three (3)
Business Days prior to Closing will receive the amount payable to such
stockholder on the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in short-term
obligations of the United States with maturities of no more than thirty (30)
days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States. Earnings on the Consideration Fund in excess of
the amounts payable to the Companys former Holders shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and shall be paid
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation as Parent directs. No investment of the
Consideration Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by this _Article
III_, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly
provide additional cash funds or shares of Parent Common Stock (as applicable)
to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Holders at the Effective Time in
the amount of such losses, which additional funds and shares of Parent Common
Stock (as applicable) will be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund.

 



 

(e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the share
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificated Shares or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the consideration described in this _Article
III_, except as otherwise provided by Law.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former Holders one (1) year
after the Effective Time shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be
delivered to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Any Holder who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with respect to its shares of
Company Common Stock or Vested Company RSU Awards shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of their claim for consideration in respect thereof.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any Party
shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash or shares of Parent Common
Stock or Parent Warrants from the Consideration Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificated Share or Uncertificated Share shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which any consideration in respect thereof
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
pursuant to applicable Law, any such consideration in respect of such share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such Certificated Share
or Uncertificated Share who has not theretofore complied with this _Article
III_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
their claim for consideration in respect thereof.

 



 

(h) If any certificate with respect to a Certificated Share shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (which
affidavit shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying
Agent) by the Person whose certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate the consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of
such certificate pursuant to this _Article III_. For the avoidance of doubt,
no Person claiming a certificate with respect to a Certificated Share to be
lost, stolen or destroyed shall be required or

 



      
 

 



 

directed by Parent or the Paying Agent to secure or post any bond or other
security in connection with such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered share of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive a portion of the Closing Stock Merger Consideration pursuant
to _Section 3.1_ until such holder shall surrender such share in accordance
with _Section 3.5_. Subject to escheat, Tax or other applicable Law,
following surrender of any such share of Company Common Stock, such holder
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or distributions, without
interest, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the Parent
Common Stock represented by such Company Common Stock. Such holder shall be
entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent
stockholders with a record date at or after the Effective Time the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock received as consideration for such shares
of Company Common Stock.

 



 

Section 3.7 _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to _Section
3.1_ that would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Common
Stock delivered by such Holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by $13.35
and rounded down to the nearest penny.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Merger Consideration Adjustments_.

 



 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, in good faith and based on
reasonable assumptions, and deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Preliminary
Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (i) a good faith estimate of the Companys
(A) Net Working Capital (" _Estimated Net Working Capital_ "), (B) Company
Expenses (" _Estimated Company Expenses_ "), (C) Indebtedness of the Acquired
Companies required to be repaid at Closing, including the Indebtedness set
forth in the Payoff Letter (" _Estimated Indebtedness_ ") and (D) Cash ("
_Estimated Cash_ "), each determined as of the close of business on the
Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, based on the Companys
books and records and other information available at the Closing and (ii) on
the basis of the foregoing, a calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration.
Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Company Expenses, Estimated
Indebtedness and Estimated Cash shall be calculated on a basis consistent with
the Applicable Accounting Principles. An illustrative example of a Preliminary
Closing Statement and calculation of Net Working Capital, Company Expenses,
Indebtedness and Cash is set forth as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Sample Statement_
"). The Company shall deliver applicable wire instructions for the repayment
of the Estimated Indebtedness concurrently with its delivery of the
Preliminary Closing Statement.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later
than forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Holders)
a written statement (the " _Final Closing Statement_ ") that shall include and
set forth a calculation in reasonable detail of the Companys actual (i) Net
Working Capital (" _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (ii) Company Expenses ("
_Closing Company Expenses_ "), (iii) Indebtedness (" _Closing Indebtedness_ ")
and (iv) Cash (" _Closing Cash_ "), each determined as of the close of
business on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Final
Closing Statement (A) shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
Applicable Accounting Principles and will take into account only the line
items reflected on the Sample Statement, and (B) shall be based exclusively on
the facts and circumstances as they exist immediately prior to the Closing
(other than with respect to shares of Company Common Stock issuable to a
holder of Company Warrants the exercise of which has been conditioned upon and
concurrently with the Closing and any Cash received in respect thereof) and
shall exclude the effects of any event, act, change in circumstances or
development arising or occurring on or after the Effective Time (other than
the exercise of such Company Warrants conditioned upon and concurrently with
the Closing) whether or not the application of generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") would require such event, act,
circumstance or development to be reflected thereon. To the extent any actions
on or following the Closing with respect to the accounting books and records
of the Company or its Subsidiaries on which the Final Closing Statement and
the foregoing calculations are to be based are not consistent with the
Companys past practices utilized in the preparation of the Company Financial
Statements (taking into account the accounting changes made in connection with
the Companys application of "Fresh Start" accounting), such changes shall not
be taken into account in preparing the Final Closing Statement or calculating
amounts reflected thereon. The Holder Representative and its Representatives
shall have the right to reasonable access to examine the work papers and other
documents of the accountants and other personnel preparing the Final Closing
Statement and the books, records and other documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to the Final Closing Statement, and to discuss the
preparation of the Final Closing Statement with the personnel who participated
in such preparation, in each case, during normal business hours and in such a
manner as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and Parent and the Company shall provide or
cause other Persons to provide all such access and information.

 



 

(c) The Final Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the
thirtieth (30th) day following delivery thereof by Parent to the Holder
Representative, unless, prior to the end of such thirty (30)-day period, the
Holder Representative (on behalf of the Holders) delivers to Parent written
notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") specifying the
nature and amount of any dispute as to the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Company Expenses, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement.

 



 

(d) During the twenty (20)-day period following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement by the Holder Representative to Parent, Parent and the Holder
Representative (on behalf of the Holders) shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the calculation of
the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Company Expenses, Closing
Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash as specified therein. Any disputed items
resolved in writing between the Holder Representative and Parent within such
twenty (20)-day

 



      
 

 



 

period shall be final and binding on all Holders with respect to such items,
and if the Holder Representative and Parent agree in writing on the resolution
of each disputed item specified by Parent in the Notice of Disagreement and
the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Company Expenses,
Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash, the amounts so determined shall be
final and binding on all Holders for all purposes hereunder. If the Holder
Representative and Parent have not resolved all such differences by the end of
such twenty (20) day period, the Holder Representative and Parent shall
submit, in writing, to an independent public accounting firm who shall act as
an expert, and not an arbitrator (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "),
reports detailing their respective views as to the correct nature and amount
of each item remaining in dispute and the amounts of the Closing Net Working
Capital, Closing Company Expenses, Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash,
and the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written determination as to
each such disputed item and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall be an independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing
by the Holder Representative and Parent. Parent and the Holder Representative
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accounting Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted
to it as promptly as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days
following the submission thereof. The Independent Accounting Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts in Parents and the Holder
Representatives respective calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash that are identified as being items
and amounts to which Parent and the Holder Representative have been unable to
agree. The Independent Accounting Firms services and authority to make a
determination shall be limited in scope to the disputed amounts, and the
Independent Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including
any determination as to whether the Target Net Working Capital or any
estimates on the Preliminary Closing Statement are correct, adequate or
sufficient. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either Party. The Independent Accounting Firms determination of
the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Company Expenses, Closing
Indebtedness and/or Closing Cash shall be based solely on the written reports
(and any other materials requested by the Independent Accounting Firm)
submitted by Parent and the Holder Representative and solely on this _Section
3.8_ and the definitions and schedules relating hereto, and not on the basis
of an independent review. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties and shall not be subject to
appeal or further review. Judgment may be entered upon the written
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with _Section
9.9_.

 



 

(e) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by
Parent, on the one hand, and the Holder Representative (on behalf of the
Holders) on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the
matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.

 



 

(f) Parent and the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, during the period from and after the date of delivery of the
Final

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Statement through the resolution of any adjustment to the Closing Cash
Merger Consideration contemplated by this _Section 3.8_, afford the other
Party (or in the case of the Holders, the Holder Representative) and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and to any other information reasonably
requested for purposes of preparing and reviewing the calculations
contemplated by this _Section 3.8_.

 



 

(g) The Closing Cash Merger Consideration shall be adjusted, upwards or
downwards, as follows:

 



 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " means an
amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) the Estimated Net
Working Capital minus the Closing Net Working Capital as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 3.8_, _plus_ (B) the Estimated Company Expenses
minus the Closing Company Expenses as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 3.8_, _plus_ (C) the Estimated Indebtedness minus the Closing
Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 3.8_, _plus_ (D)
the Estimated Cash minus the Closing Cash as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 3.8_.

 



 

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Closing Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net
Adjustment Amount. In such event, (A) within three (3) Business Days of the
final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount, Parent shall (x) pay the
portion of the Net Adjustment Amount payable to the stockholders whose shares
were converted into the right to receive Closing Merger Consideration to the
Paying Agent for delivery to such stockholders ( _provided_ that any
stockholder paid directly by Parent or its Subsidiaries at the Closing shall
be paid such stockholders portion of the Net Adjustment Amount directly by
Parent or its Subsidiaries) and (y) pay the portion of the Net Adjustment
Amount payable to the holders of Vested Company RSU Awards to (1) the Paying
Agent for delivery to such holder (if payable by the Paying Agent pursuant to
_Section 3.5(a)_) or (2) the Surviving Corporation for delivery to such
holders using the payment procedures set forth in _Section 3.2(b)_ if not
payable by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 3.5(a)_, in each case such
payments to be made in cash and pro rata in accordance with their respective
Fully Diluted Percentage; and (B) the Holder Representative and Parent shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow
Agent to pay to the Holder Representative the funds in the Escrow Account for
the benefit of the Holders, and the Holder Representative shall deposit such
amount with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Holders, and the Paying
Agent shall promptly distribute to each Holder its pro rata portion thereof in
accordance with their respective Fully Diluted Percentage; _provided_ that,
with respect to any such payment to a holder of Vested Company RSU Awards for
whom withholding by the Surviving Corporation is required, the Holder
Representative shall deposit with the Surviving Corporation any portion of
such amount payable to such holder and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, no later than
the

 



      
 

 



 

first regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least three (3) Business
Days following such deposit, to distribute to each such holder the amount
specified in instructions received from the Holder Representative, and in such
circumstances, the amount deposited with the Paying Agent shall be reduced
accordingly.

 



 

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the "Net
Adjustment Amount" for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount, _provided_ that, if the Net
Adjustment Amount is negative, the Net Adjustment Amount shall not exceed the
amount of funds available in the Escrow Account), the Closing Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net
Adjustment Amount, and Parent and the Holder Representative shall promptly
(but in any event within three (3) Business Days of the final determination of
the Net Adjustment Amount) deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent to pay to Parent the Net Adjustment Amount by wire transfer from the
funds available in the Escrow Account to one (1) or more accounts designated
by Parent to the Holder Representative.

 



 

(iv) In the event that the funds available in the Escrow Account are in excess
of the Net Adjustment Amount, then the Holder Representative and Parent shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deposit such amount
with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Holders, and the Paying Agent
shall promptly distribute to each Holder his, her or its pro rata portion
thereof in accordance with their respective Fully Diluted Percentage;
_provided_ that, with respect to any such payment to a holder of Vested
Company RSU Awards from whom withholding by the Surviving Corporation is
required, the Holder Representative shall deposit with the Surviving
Corporation any portion of such amount payable to such holder and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation, through the Surviving Corporations payroll
system, no later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date that is at
least three (3) Business Days following such deposit, to distribute to each
such holder the amount specified in instructions received from the Holder
Representative, and in such circumstances, the amount deposited with the
Paying Agent shall be reduced accordingly.

 



 

(h) Payments in respect of _Section 3.8(g)_ shall be made within three (3)
Business Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to
the provisions of this _Section 3.8_ by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by
the Party entitled to such payment at least two (2) Business Days prior to
such payment date.

 



 

(i) Payments in respect of _Section 3.8(g)_ shall be treated as an adjustment

Section 3.9 _Holder Representative_.

 



 

(a) Upon adoption of this _Section 3.9_ pursuant to the Company Stockholder
Approval, each Dragging Holder has irrevocably appointed the Holder
Representative as such Holders representative, agent, proxy and attorney-in-
fact, with full power of substitution to act on behalf of the Holders
including the full power and authority to act on the Holders behalf to,
including (i) consummate the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
(including the adjustments under _Section 3.8_) and the other agreements,
instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection
herewith; (ii) negotiate disputes arising under, or relating to, this
Agreement (including with respect to the adjustments under _Section 3.8_) and
the other agreements, instruments, and documents contemplated hereby or
executed in connection herewith; and (iii) execute and deliver any consent,
amendment or waiver to this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments
and documents contemplated hereby or executed in connection herewith (without
the prior approval of the Holders), and such agency and proxy are coupled with
an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Holder
Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy,
dissolution or liquidation of any Holder. All decisions, actions, consents and
instructions by the Holder Representative shall be binding upon all of the
Holders, and no Holder shall have the right to object to, dissent from,
protest or otherwise contest the same. Parent shall not have the right to
object to, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, dissent from, protest or
otherwise contest the authority of the Holder Representative. Each of Parent
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely on any decision, action,
consent or instruction of the Holder Representative as being the decision,
action, consent or instruction of each and every Holder, and each of Parent
and the Paying Agent are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for
acts done by them in accordance with any such decision, act, consent or
instruction. By their approval of this Agreement, each Holder shall be deemed
to have waived any claims he, she or it may have or assert, including those
that may arise in the future, against the Holder Representative for any action
or inaction taken or not taken by the Holder Representative in connection with
such Persons capacity as Holder Representative, except to the extent that
such action or inaction shall have been held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to constitute intentional and knowing fraud.

 



 

(b) All acts of the Holder Representative hereunder in its capacity as such
shall be deemed to be acts on behalf of the Holders and not of the Holder
Representative individually. The Holder Representative shall not have any
liability for any amount owed to Parent pursuant to this Agreement. The Holder
Representative shall not be liable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person in its capacity as the Holder Representative, for any liability
of a Holder.

 



 

(c) The Holder Representative shall have the right to recover from, in its
sole discretion, the Holder Representative Account, prior to any distribution
to the Holders, the Holder Representatives reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in the performance of its duties hereunder (" _Charges_ "), including
those resulting from the employment of financial advisors, attorneys, auditors
and other advisors and agents. Following full reimbursement of all Charges, in
the event that there are any remaining funds in the Holder Representative
Account, the Holder Representative shall distribute such amount to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the Holders, and the Paying Agent shall promptly
distribute to each Holder his, her or its pro rata portion thereof in
accordance with their respective Fully Diluted Percentage; _provided_ that,
with respect to any such payment to a holder of Vested Company RSU Awards for
whom withholding by the Surviving Corporation is required, the Holder
Representative shall deposit with the

 



      
 

 



 

Surviving Corporation any portion of such amount payable to such holder and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, through the Surviving
Corporations payroll system, no later than the first regularly scheduled
payroll date that is at least three (3) Business Days following such deposit,
to distribute to each such holder the amount specified in instructions
received from the Holder Representative and, in such circumstances, the amount
deposited with the Paying Agent shall be reduced accordingly. In the event the
Holder Representative Amount is insufficient to satisfy the Charges, then each
Holder will be obligated to pay his, her or its pro rata portion of such
deficit.

 



 

(d) The Holders agree to indemnify the Holder Representative, on a pro rata
basis in accordance with their respective Fully Diluted Percentage, for any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Holder Representative in any way relating to or arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Holder
Representatives duties hereunder or any documents contemplated by or referred
to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof; _provided_ that, no Holder
shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise out of the
Holder Representatives commission of intentional and knowing fraud.

 



 

(e) The Holder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed for
any reason or no reason by the written consent of the holders of a majority of
the aggregate Fully Diluted Shares at the Effective Time (the " _Majority
Holders_ "). In the event of the death, incapacity, resignation or removal of
the Holder Representative, a new Holder Representative shall be appointed by
the written consent of the Majority Holders. A copy of such written consent
appointing such new Holder Representative shall be sent to Parent and, after
the Effective Time, to the Surviving Corporation, such appointment to be
effective upon the later of the date indicated in such consent or the date
such consent is received by Parent and, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 3.10 _Withholding Rights_. The Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent, the
Holder Representative, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from consideration otherwise payable to a
holder of Company Common Stock or Company RSU Awards, or other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts as may be required to be withheld or
deducted with respect to such consideration under the Code or any other
provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and are paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity,
such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
or withholding was made. If Parent determines that any withholding described
in this _Section 3.10_ may be required, Parent shall notify the Company of
any such requirement as soon as reasonably practical after such determination
is made by Parent and shall cooperate in good faith with the Company to reduce
or eliminate any such withholding.

 



 

Section 3.11 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real
property, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes, fees and costs
(including any associated penalties and interest) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ")
incurred in connection with this Agreement, if any, shall be

 



      
 

 



 

borne one hundred percent (100%) by Parent, and Parent shall timely file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any such
Transfer Taxes.

Companies to perform under or comply with any applicable Law, action, judgment
or Contract, but would include such liabilities and obligations if there has
been a default or failure to perform or comply by the Acquired Companies with

are now being conducted in all material respects (the " _Company Permits_ ").

of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event) will (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due to any
current or former employee, director or consultant of the Acquired Companies
under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any compensation or
benefits otherwise payable or to be provided under any Company Benefit Plan,
(iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of
any material compensation or benefits, (iv) result in the payment of any
amount that could, individually or in combination with any other payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment," as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of
the Code or (v) limit the ability of an Acquired Company to terminate or amend
a material Company Benefit Plan in any jurisdiction.

 



 

(e) Each material Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and operated in
documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code or an
available exemption therefrom. No Acquired Company is a party to nor does it
have any obligation under any material Company Benefit Plan to compensate any
Person for excise Taxes payable pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code or for
Taxes payable pursuant to Section 409A or 457A of the Code.

Company Foreign Benefit Plan has been established, maintained and administered
in material compliance with its terms and applicable Laws, and if intended to
qualify for special tax treatment, meets all the requirements for such
treatment, (ii) all employer and employee contributions to each Company
Foreign Benefit Plan required by its terms or by applicable Law have been made
or, if applicable, accrued in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the applicable
jurisdiction applied to such matters and (iii) the fair market value of the
assets of each funded Company Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each
insurer for any Company Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the
book reserve established for any Company Foreign Benefit Plan, together with
any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to all
current and former participants in such plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Company Foreign Benefit Plan, and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations. No Company Foreign
Benefit Plan is a defined benefit pension plan or provides post-employment
health or life insurance benefits.

form of anti-takeover Laws or regulations is applicable to the Merger.

 



 

Section 4.22 _No Deferred Payment Obligations_. There are no deferred payment
obligations of any Acquired Company in connection with any acquisition by such
Acquired Company of any business, material amount of stock or assets of
another Person or any real property (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of
assets or otherwise).

 



 

Section 4.23 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except (a) as set forth in _Section
4.23_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (b) for employment, compensation and
benefit arrangements and Contracts and (c) arrangements and Contracts solely
between or among Acquired Companies, no officer, director, equity holder,
partner or member of any Acquired Company, or any of their Affiliates, is a
party to any Contract or business arrangement with any Acquired Company (each
such Contract or business arrangement, an " _Affiliate Agreement_ ").

 



 

Section 4.24 _Assets_. Each of the Acquired Companies has good and valid title
to, a valid leasehold interest in or an enforceable right to use, all of the
material assets, equipment and other tangible personal property that are
material to the business of the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, and that
are used in the conduct of such business as presently conducted, free and
clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens. All of such assets, equipment
and other tangible personal property, taken as a whole, are, in all material
respects, in good working condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and
are not dangerous or in need of renewal or replacement, except for any renewal
or replacement in the ordinary course of business. To the knowledge of the
Company, there are no physical conditions affecting the material assets and
property of the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, which would interfere in
any material respect with the use of such assets and property in the business
of the Acquired Companies as currently conducted, taken as a whole.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty in this _Section
4.24_ is made with respect to or intellectual property matters or real
property matters, which are addressed exclusively in _Section 4.14_ and
_Section 4.15_, respectively.

 



 

Section 4.25 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this _Article IV_, each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges that neither the Company or any other Acquired Company nor any
Representative of the Company or any other Acquired Company makes, and each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that it has not relied upon or otherwise
been induced by, any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to the Company or the other Acquired Companies or with respect to any
other information provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
information, documents, projections, synergies, forecasts or other material
made available to Parent and Merger Sub or to their respective Representatives
in certain "data rooms" (whether virtual or on-site) or management
presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and any such other representations or warranties are hereby
expressly disclaimed and none shall be implied at

 



      
 

 



 

law or in equity. None of the Acquired Companies or any Affiliate or
Representative thereof, whether in an individual, corporate or any other
capacity, will have or be subject to any liability (indemnification or
otherwise) to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or Representatives
resulting from (nor shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives have any claim with respect to) the distribution to Parent,
Merger Sub or their Affiliates or Representatives, or Parents, Merger Subs
or their Affiliates or Representatives use of, or reliance on, any
information, documents, projections, synergies, forecasts or other material
made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives, whether through any "data rooms" or presentations (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any "management presentations") or otherwise, in
expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise, regardless of the legal theory under which such
liability may be sought to be imposed, whether in contract or tort, at law or
in equity, or otherwise, except in each case with respect to the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in this
_Article IV_ and for fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation in the making of the representations and warranties set
forth in this _Article IV_. Without in any way limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make projections, forward looking
statements and other forecasts and estimates (including with respect to
synergies), and certain business plan information, that each of Parent and
Merger Sub is familiar with such uncertainties, that each of Parent and Merger
Sub is making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of any such
projections, forward looking statements, forecasts, estimates (in each case
including with respect to synergies) and business plan information provided to
it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such projections,
forward looking statements, forecasts, synergies, estimates and business plan
information), that no representations, warranties or statements (including by
omission) of any kind are being made with respect thereto by the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, that
Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
is relying thereon and that Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates
and Representatives shall have no claim against anyone with respect thereto.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_**

 



 

Except as disclosed in the applicable Section of the disclosure letter
delivered by Parent to the Company immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that

as presently conducted and is qualified to do business where the

 



      
 

 



 

ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so

or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Capitalization_. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2_ of the
Parent Disclosure Letter:

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 400,000,000 shares of

Agreement, (i) Parent does not have any shares issued or outstanding, and (ii)

Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or
equity interests (in each case other than to Parent or a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent), (B) grant, extend or enter into any such subscription,
option, warrant, put, call, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
similar right, agreement or commitment, (C) redeem or otherwise acquire any

Section 5.3 _Authority Relative to This Agreement; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub have all requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and, subject (in the case of the Merger) to receipt
of the Parent Approvals (which shall respectively occur immediately prior to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement), to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly
and validly authorized by Parent and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Parent are necessary to authorize the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. On or prior to the date hereof, the Board of Directors of
Parent has unanimously (i) resolved that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of Parent and the
stockholders of Parent and (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of the Company, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, examinership, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting or
relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) equitable
remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

 



 

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the provisions of
the DGCL and (ii) the Competition Act Clearance, no authorization, consent or
approval of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is necessary, under
applicable Law, for the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for such authorizations,
consents, approvals or filings that, if not obtained or made, would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.3(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter
and as described in _Section 5.3(b)_, the execution and delivery by Parent
and Merger Sub of this Agreement do not, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i)
result in any violation or breach of, or default or change of control (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of,
or result in, termination, modification, cancellation or acceleration of any
material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any Contract,
loan, guarantee of Indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, Material Lease, permit, concession, franchise or right binding upon
Parent or Merger Sub or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties, rights or assets of Parent or Merger Sub, other than Permitted
Liens, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision of the
Parent Governing Documents or the Merger Sub Governing

 



      
 

 



 

Documents or (iii) conflict with or violate any Laws applicable to Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or assets, other than in the
case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), any such violation, breach, conflict,
default, termination, modification, cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or
Lien that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed or furnished all
forms, documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the
date hereof by it with the SEC (all such documents and reports filed or
furnished by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Parent SEC Documents_
") and has timely paid all fees due in connection therewith. As of their
respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the
dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively),
the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act as of the time of filing with the SEC, as the case may be, and none of the
Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. None of Parents Subsidiaries is, or at any time
has been, required to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.
As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Parent has failed in
any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section
302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. There are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in any comment letters of the staff of the SEC received by Parent
relating to the Parent SEC Documents. To the knowledge of Parent, none of the
Parent SEC Documents are the subject of ongoing SEC review.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in or incorporated by reference into the Parent
SEC Documents (the " _Parent Financial Statements_ ") are true and correct in
all material respects and reflect the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of and for the
periods covered thereby (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or,
in the case of unaudited financial statements, for the absence of footnotes
and, in the case of interim financial statements, to the extent they are
subject to normally recurring year-end adjustments which are not material
either individually or in the aggregate). The Parent Financial Statements were
prepared from, are in accordance with and accurately reflect in all material
respects, the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, which books
and records have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved with respect to all financial
transactions of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement do
not, and, except as described in _Section 5.3(b)_, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not (i) result in any violation or breach of, or default or change of
control (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of, or result in, termination, modification, cancellation or
acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit
under any Contract, loan, guarantee of Indebtedness or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, Material

 



   



 



 

     
 

 



 

Lease, permit, concession, franchise or right binding upon Parent or Merger
Sub or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties, rights
or assets of Parent or Merger Sub, other than Permitted Liens, (ii) conflict
with or result in any violation of any provision of the Parent Governing
Documents or the Merger Sub Governing Documents or (iii) conflict with or
violate any Laws applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
properties or assets, other than in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii),
any such violation, breach, conflict, default, termination, modification,
cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

Section 5.5 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as disclosed, reflected
or reserved against in Parents unaudited consolidated balance sheet (or the
notes thereto) as of March 31, 2018 (the " _Parent Balance Sheet Date_ "), (b)
for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since the Parent Balance Sheet Date, (c) as expressly permitted
or contemplated by this Agreement, (d) for liabilities which have been
discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, and (e) that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
material to the business of the Parent or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise.
For purposes of this _Section 5.5_, the term "liabilities" shall not include
obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to perform under or comply
with any applicable Law, action, judgment or Contract, but would include such
liabilities and obligations if there has been a default or failure to perform
or comply by Parent or its Subsidiaries with any such liability or obligation
if such default or failure would, with the giving of notice or passage of time
or both, reasonably be expected to result in a monetary obligation or the
imposition of injunctive or other equitable remedies.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 



 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with and are not in default
under or in violation of any Laws applicable to Parent or its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets, except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) To the knowledge of Parent, the Parent and its Subsidiaries are in
possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, clearances,
approvals, registrations and orders of any Governmental Entity necessary for
Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and
assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the "
_Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Parent
Permits would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in full
force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) From the Parent Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement,
there has not occurred any event, development, occurrence, change or state of
fact that has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 



 

(b) From the Parent Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that would
constitute a breach of clause (ii) of the first paragraph of _Section 6.2_
had such action been taken after the execution of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Finders and Brokers_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has employed
any investment banker, broker or finder in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement who might be entitled to any fee or any
commission in connection with or upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Required Vote_. No vote or consent of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement or
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Parent Approvals
(which have been obtained) constitute the only consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Capitalization and Operations of Merger Sub_. All of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will
be, owned by an indirect majority-owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has
been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, has not conducted any business prior to the
date of this Agreement, and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have
no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident
to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Availability of Funds; Financing_. As of the Closing Date,
Parent shall have available to it sufficient funds to enable it to pay the
Closing Cash Merger Consideration (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.8_) and
all other amounts to be paid or repaid by Parent under this Agreement (whether
payable on or after the Closing) and all of Parents and its Affiliates fees
and expenses associated with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in accordance with the terms hereof. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of the
fully executed (a) debt commitment letter from Bank of America, N.A., Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands
Branch, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.,
Barclays Bank PLC and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. (collectively, the "
_Lenders_ "), dated as of the date hereof, (including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments thereto) and together with any Fee Letter associated
therewith ( _provided_ , that provisions in the Fee Letter related to fees,
"flex" terms and other economic or commercially sensitive terms have been
redacted (none of which redacted provisions would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the conditionality, availability or aggregate amount of the
debt financing contemplated thereby)) (collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_
"), pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Lenders have
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the debt financing contemplated thereby, hereafter and as amended
or replaced from time to time in compliance with _Section 6.6_, the "
_Financing_ "). As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter, in the form so
delivered, is in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof
and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge
of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to the effect of any applicable
Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium,
fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfers, or similar Laws relating to
or affecting creditors rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). As of the
date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent, no such commitment has
been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated, rescinded, amended, supplemented or
modified, in any respect, and no such withdrawal, termination, repudiation,
rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated. As of the
date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any
other counterparty thereto has committed any breach of any of its covenants or
other obligations set forth in, or is in default under, the Commitment Letter,
and, as of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent no event has
occurred or circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would or would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute or result in a
breach or default on the part of any Person under the Commitment Letter, (ii)
constitute or result in a failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions
set forth in the Commitment Letter, (iii) make any of the assumptions or any
of the statements set forth in the Commitment Letter inaccurate in any
material respect or (iv) otherwise result in any portion of the Financing not
being available. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ and
the compliance in all material respects by the Company with _Section 6.6_,
Parent has no reason to believe (both before and after giving effect to any
"flex" provisions contained in the Commitment Letter) that it will be unable
to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition to be satisfied by it
contained in the Commitment Letter or that the full amounts committed pursuant
to the Commitment Letter will not be available as of the Closing if the terms
or conditions to be satisfied by it contained in the Commitment Letter are
satisfied. There are no conditions precedent or other conditions related to
the Financing other than the terms thereof set forth in the Commitment Letter.
As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has fully paid, or has caused to be
fully paid, any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by
the Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. The
aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the financing required
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
together with cash on hand, are sufficient in amount to provide Parent with
the funds necessary for it to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement, including for Parent to
pay the aggregate amounts payable pursuant to _Article II_ and the payment of
all fees, costs and expenses to be paid by Parent related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including such fees, costs and expenses
relating to the Financing.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. As of the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns,
directly or indirectly, any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities
convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company
Common Stock. There are no voting trusts or other

 



      
 

 



 

agreements or understandings to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity interest
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby to which it is, or is
specified to be, a party, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent
and Merger Sub are Solvent as of the date of this Agreement, and, assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and each of the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries
will, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Financing and the payment of the aggregate amounts
payable pursuant to Article II and Article III and the payment of all fees,
costs and expenses to be paid by Parent related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including such fees, costs and expenses
relating to the Financing), be Solvent immediately following the Closing.

 



 

Section 5.15 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this _Article V_, the Company acknowledges that
neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any Representative thereof makes, and the
Company acknowledges that it has not relied upon or otherwise been induced by,
any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent
or Merger Sub or with respect to any other information provided or made
available to the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any information, documents, projections, synergies,
forecasts or other material made available to the Company or its
Representatives in certain "data rooms" or management presentations in
expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any such
other representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed and none
shall be implied at law or in equity. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any
Affiliate or Representative thereof, whether in an individual, corporate or
any other capacity, will have or be subject to any liability (indemnification
or otherwise) to any Acquired Company or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives resulting from (nor shall any Acquired Company or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives have any claim with respect to) the distribution
to any Acquired Company or their Affiliates or Representatives, or the
Acquired Companies or their Affiliates or Representatives use of, or
reliance on, any information, documents, projections, synergies, forecasts or
other material made available to the Acquired Companies or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives in expectation of, or in connection with, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, regardless of the
legal theory under which such liability may be sought to be imposed, whether
in contract or tort, at law or in equity, or otherwise, except in each case
with respect to the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub
expressly set forth in this _Article V_ and for fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation in the making of the representations and
warranties set forth in this _Article V_. Without in any way limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make projections, forward looking
statements and other forecasts and estimates (including with respect to
synergies), and certain business plan information, that the Company is
familiar with such uncertainties, that the Company is making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of any such projections, forward
looking statements, forecasts, estimates (in each case including with respect
to synergies) and business plan information provided to it in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the reasonableness

 



      
 

 



 

of the assumptions underlying such projections, forward looking statements,
forecasts, synergies, estimates and business plan information), that no
representations, warranties or statements (including by omission) of any kind
are being made with respect thereto by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives, that no Acquired Company nor any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives is relying thereon and that no
Acquired Company nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
shall have any claim against anyone with respect thereto.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 ** _COVENANTS_**

 



 

Section 6.1 _Conduct of Business by the Company Pending the Closing_. The
Company agrees that between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to

Disclosure Letter, (2) as required by this Agreement or any document,

this _Section 6.4(b)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this

greater than 3.5% (as calculated in accordance with WSIIs credit agreement
for the last four consecutive fiscal quarters of WSII then last ended for
which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to WSIIs credit

the Combined Business (a " _Regulatory Adverse Effect_ "). The Parties shall
consult and cooperate with one another, and

costs and expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith, including
compliance by the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives under _Section 6.7_ hereof, except to the extent (A) arising
out of the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Company,
the Companys Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives or (B) arising

to Parent or any Financing Source expressly for use in connection with the
Financing.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent shall use, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use, their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions

(c) Parent shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of, any condition, remedy
or other provision under any Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment,
supplement, modification, replacement or waiver would or would reasonably be
expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing from that
contemplated by the Commitment Letter delivered as of the date hereof, unless
other financing is increased by a corresponding amount and the terms of such
other financing would not otherwise violate the provisions of this _Section
6.6(c)_, (ii) impose additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impair the ability or
likelihood of Parent to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by

(including by making the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to
occur) on the Closing Date taking into account the Marketing Period or

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) adversely
impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other parties
to the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements. Parent shall not agree
to the withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission of any Commitment
Letter or Financing Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Company, and shall not release or consent to the termination of the
obligations of the Lenders under the Commitment Letter, unless other Financing
is incurred by a corresponding amount and the terms of such other Financing
would not otherwise violate the provisions of this _Section 6.6(c)_. Upon any
amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of, or waiver of, the
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement in accordance with this _Section
6.6_ (other than (1) amendments or modifications solely for the purpose of
joining additional arrangers or financing sources following the date hereof to
the extent effected pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter or (2) any
amendments or modifications to the terms that have been redacted under the Fee
Letter in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the conditionality, availability or aggregate amount of the debt financing
contemplated by the related Commitment Letter), Parent shall deliver a copy
thereof to the Company and references herein to "Commitment Letter" and
"Financing Agreements" shall include and mean such documents as amended,
supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this _Section
6.6_ and references to "Financing" shall include and mean the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements as amended,
supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this _Section
6.6_, as applicable.

 



 

(d) In the event that all or any portion of the Financing becomes or could
become unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex"
provisions) or from the sources contemplated in the Commitment Letter or the
Financing Agreements for any reason or the Commitment Letter or the Financing
Agreements shall be withdrawn, terminated, repudiated or rescinded for any
reason (but without limiting the obligations of Parent in the penultimate
sentence of _Section 6.6(c)_ and in _Section 6.6(b)(iv)_), (i) Parent shall
promptly so notify the Company and (ii) Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the Closing), and
to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to, alternative
financing from the same or alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_
") in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (or replace any unavailable portion of the Financing) with terms and
conditions (including market flex provisions), and to obtain a new financing
commitment letter (including any associated engagement letter and related Fee
Letter ( _provided_ , that provisions in such Fee Letter related to fees,
"flex" terms and other economic or commercially sensitive terms have been
redacted (none of which redacted provisions would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the conditionality, availability or aggregate amount of the
debt financing contemplated thereby)) with respect to such Alternative
Financing (collectively, the " _New Commitment Letter_ "), copies of which
shall be promptly provided to the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event will the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to
require Parent to (A) pay fees materially in excess of those contained in the
Commitment Letter and Fee Letter (including the market flex provisions) or
agree to "market flex" terms, materially less favorable to Parent than the
corresponding market flex terms contained in or contemplated by the Fee Letter
relating to the Commitment Letter (taken as whole) or (B) enter into any
alternative financing terms the terms of which are materially less favorable
to Parent than the terms

 



      
 

 



 

contained in the Commitment Letter on the date hereof (taken as a whole). No
Alternative Financing or New Commitment Letter may expand upon the conditions
precedent or contingencies to the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date
as set forth in the Commitment Letter in effect on the date hereof or
otherwise include terms (including any "flex" provisions) that would
reasonably be expected to make the likelihood that the Alternative Financing
would be funded less likely. In the event any Alternative Financing is
obtained and a New Commitment Letter is entered into in accordance with this
_Section 6.6(d)_, Parent shall deliver a copy thereof to the Company and
references herein to (A) "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include and
mean the Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Commitment
Letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and any New Commitment
Letter to the extent then in effect, and (B) "Financing" shall include and
mean the debt financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as modified
pursuant to the preceding clause (A). Without the Companys prior written
consent, Parent shall not directly or indirectly take any action that would or
would be reasonably expected to result in the Financing not being available.

 



 

(e) Parent shall (i) upon the reasonable request of the Company, furnish the
Company drafts (when available) and thereafter true and complete and executed
copies of the Lender Consent (as defined in _Section 5.3(c)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and the Financing Agreements promptly upon their execution,
(ii) give the Company prompt written notice of any default, breach or
threatened breach (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
default or breach) by any party to the Commitment Letter or the Financing
Agreements of which Parent or any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives becomes aware or any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or
rescission or threatened withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission
thereof and (iii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or any Alternative Financing).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice (A) of the receipt or delivery of any notice or other
communication, in each case from any Person with respect to (x) any actual or
potential default under or breach of any provisions of the Commitment Letter
or Financing Agreements by Parent, or any withdrawal, termination, repudiation
or rescission or threatened withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission
thereof by any party to the Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements or (y)
any dispute or disagreement between or among parties to any of the Commitment
Letter or Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing and (B)
if at any time for any reason Parent reasonably believes that it will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources, contemplated by any of the
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements or will be unable to obtain
Alternative Financing, in each case in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall promptly provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance
referred to in clause (A) or (B) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing
or any Alternative Financing is a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing or any
Alternative Financing, or the completion of any such issuance, subject to the
applicable conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.7 _Financing Cooperation_. Subject to _Section 6.6(a)_, prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
to, at Parents sole expense, use its and their respective reasonable best
efforts to provide such cooperation in connection with the arrangement,
syndication and consummation of the Financing as is customary and may be
reasonably requested by Parent, _provided_ that such requested cooperation
does not, in the Companys reasonable judgment, unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Such
cooperation by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall include using
its and their reasonable best efforts to: (i) subject to _Section 6.6_,
provide all information regarding the Acquired Companies reasonably requested
by Parent and its Financing Sources (or any replacement thereof) for the
preparation of a customary information memorandum for a syndicated loan or
bridge financing and customary offering memorandum for a Rule 144A offering of
high yield debt securities, including without limitation (a) the Required
Information that is Compliant and (b) all financial information of the Company
and its Subsidiaries derived from the historical books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries that is required to permit Parent and Merger Sub
to prepare the pro forma financial statements required pursuant to paragraph
10 of Exhibit E of the Commitment Letter as in effect as of the date hereof,
_provided_ that Parent, and not the Company or its Subsidiaries, shall be
responsible for the preparation of any pro forma financial statements and pro
forma adjustments giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, provide reasonable and customary
assistance, with respect to information regarding the Acquired Companies, with
the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, road shows, bank
information memoranda, private placement memoranda and other customary
marketing materials and provide reasonable cooperation with the due diligence
efforts of the Financing Sources with respect to the Acquired Companies to the
extent reasonable and customary, including delivery to Parent and the
Financing Sources of such due diligence materials with respect to the Acquired
Companies as are reasonably available and reasonably requested by Parent and
customarily delivered in connection with such presentations, memoranda or
marketing materials, (iii) to the extent required by the Financing Sources, in
the case of an offering of high yield debt securities as part of the
Financing, request the independent auditors of the Company to cooperate with
Parent to obtain a customary comfort letter, (iv) assist Parent in obtaining
customary payoff letters, Lien terminations and instruments of discharge to
allow for the payoff, discharge and termination of all Indebtedness under the
Company Credit Agreement and all other documents reasonably requested by
Parent or its Financing Sources relating to the repayment in full of the
existing indebtedness of the Acquired Companies under the Company Credit
Agreement and release of all related Liens and guarantees, (v) provide all
documentation and other information with respect to the Acquired Companies
required by U.S. bank regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-
customer," anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without
limitation the USA PATRIOT Act, relating to the Acquired Companies at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in each case as reasonably
requested by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
(vi) assist in the preparation, execution and delivery of definitive financing
documents, including guarantee and collateral documents and customary closing
certificates as may be required by the Financing and other customary documents
as may be reasonably requested by Parent and cooperate to facilitate the
pledging of, granting of security interests in and obtaining perfection of any
liens on, collateral in connection with the Financing, but in no event shall
any of the foregoing be effective until as of or after the Closing, (vii)
cooperate with Parent, and take all corporate

 



      
 

 



 

actions or other similar actions reasonably necessary to facilitate the
satisfaction on a timely basis of all conditions precedent to obtaining the
Financing that are within the Acquired Companies control and (viii) at
Parents reasonable request, use reasonable best efforts to (A) assist with
the preparation of a customary borrowing base certificate (solely to the
extent relating to assets of the Acquired Companies), including relating to
the borrowing base contemplated by the Commitment Letter, delivering
applicable supporting information and documentation and assisting, and
providing cooperation with and access to representatives of the Financing
Sources to conduct commercial field examinations, inventory appraisals and
other customary appraisals and field exams (solely to the extent relating to
assets of the Acquired Companies), (B) permit the prospective lenders involved
in the Financing to evaluate in a customary manner the Company and its
Subsidiaries current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies
and procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements, and (C) cooperate with Parent to establish bank and other
accounts and blocked account agreements and lock box arrangements in
connection with the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, (A) neither the Company nor any of the Companys Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or enter into any
binding agreement or commitment or incur any other actual or potential
liability or obligation in connection with the Financing (or any Alternative
Financing) prior to the Closing, (B) no director, manager, officer or employee
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to deliver
any certificate or take any other action pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ to
the extent any such action would reasonably be expected to result in personal
liability to such director, manager, officer or employee, (C) none of the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors
or officers shall be obligated to adopt resolutions or execute consents to
approve or authorize the Financing; _provided_ that, this clause (C) shall not
prohibit the adoption or execution of any resolutions or consents effective no
earlier than the Effective Time by any persons that shall remain or will
become officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time; and any documentation executed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ shall not become effective
until the Effective Time. (D) neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that would reasonably be
expected, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, to conflict with, or

documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any contract or
obligations of confidentiality (not created in contemplation hereof) binding
on the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (E) neither the Company nor

disclose information that the Company determines would jeopardize any
attorneyclient privilege or other similar privilege of the Company or any of

Subsidiary of the Company or change any fiscal period or prepare or provide
any information not readily available to the Company. The Company hereby
consents to the use of the trademarks and logos of the Acquired Companies in

used solely in a manner that is not intended to or does not harm or disparage
any of the Acquired Companies. All non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with
the Confidentiality

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement; provided that, upon notice to the Company, Parent may provide such
information to potential sources of capital and to rating agencies and
prospective lenders and investors during syndication and marketing of the
Financing (including any permitted alternative financing) subject to customary
confidentiality arrangements with such Persons regarding such information.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other
Party; _provided_ , that such Party may issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement without the prior consent of the other Party if such Party (a)
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that such press release
or other public announcement is required by applicable Law or the
Stockholders Agreement and (b) endeavors, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to

advance and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall be permitted to provide a copy of this Agreement and appropriate

Section 6.9 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. For not
less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all
individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time are or were directors or
officers of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or who, at the request of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, are
serving or have served as directors, managers, members or officers of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual
or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law; _provided_ , that such
Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to which a court
of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final, nonappealable judgment
such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding in
respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior
to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in connection with such Persons serving as an officer,
director or other fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or of any Person if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law or provided pursuant to the Company Governing Documents or the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification
agreements with the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, if any, in existence on
the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that all rights to elimination
of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their
respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect. For six (6) years after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the
provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents and the organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement and
(ii) any other agreements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with any
Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination of liability,
indemnification of officers and directors and advancement of expenses that are
in existence on the date of this Agreement, provided that these provisions may
be amended, modified or repealed in any manner so long as such amendment,
modification or repeal would not adversely affect the rights or protections
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), in
each case to the extent permitted under applicable Law. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not less than six
(6) years from the Effective Time, the Companys current directors and
officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time that is no less favorable than
the Companys existing policy. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such
Person may seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.9_, the
provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall continue in effect with respect to
such matter until the final disposition of all claims, actions,
investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_. The
rights and obligations under this _Section 6.9_ shall survive consummation of
the Merger and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse
to any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified
Party. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her legal representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section 6.9_ shall apply, without limitation, to the persons listed in
_Section 6.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, each of which shall be deemed
an officer for all purposes under this _Section 6.9_.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b)
if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing,
to take all action necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each employee of the Acquired
Companies as of the Closing Date who remains employed by an Acquired Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent and/or its Affiliates as of the Closing Date
(each, a " _Company Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate
that is at least equal to that in effect for such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Closing, (ii) an annual cash incentive compensation opportunity
that is substantially similar in the aggregate to that in effect for such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) employee benefits
(excluding any retention, severance, change in control or equity related
compensation) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those being
provided or made available to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Closing.

 



 

(b) From and following the Closing Date, Company Employees and their eligible
dependents and beneficiaries shall be eligible to participate in the Company
Benefit Plans or such other employee benefit plans, programs, policies,
practices or arrangements established by the Company, Parent and/or their
Affiliates for such employees (collectively, the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), in
each case in accordance with their terms.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, credit the Company
Employees with service earned prior to the Closing Date with each Acquired
Company and its Affiliates and predecessors, (i) to the extent that service is
relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting or the calculation of vacation,
sick days or other paid time off under any New Benefit Plan (excluding equity-
based compensation vesting) and (ii) for such additional purposes as may be
required by applicable Law; _provided_ that, nothing herein shall result in a
duplication of benefits.

 



 

(d) For purposes of each New Benefit Plan, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all preexisting condition exclusions of such New
Benefit Plan to be waived for the Company Employees and their covered
dependents to the extent waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan.
With respect to any New Benefit Plan that provides group health benefits,
Parent shall take commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by a Company Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Company Benefit Plan ending on the
date such Company Employees participation in the corresponding New Benefit
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Benefit Plan for purposes
of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Benefit Plan.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Acquired Company shall take such actions
as Parent may reasonably request relating to the Modular Space Corporation
401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_"), including amending and/or
terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time, contingent on the
occurrence of the Closing and subject to the terms and conditions of the
401(k) Plan and applicable Law, provided any such request is made in writing
no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time. If the
401(k) Plan is

 



      
 

 



 

terminated, Parent shall designate a tax-qualified defined contribution
retirement plan with a cash or deferred arrangement that is sponsored by the
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_") to cover
employees of the Acquired Companies effective as of the Closing, and shall
count service with the Acquired Companies as service with Parent for purposes
of eligibility and vesting under the Parent 401(k) Plan. Parent shall cause
the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept from the 401(k) Plan the "direct rollover" of
the account balance (including the in-kind rollover of promissory notes
evidencing all outstanding loans) of each employee of the Acquired Companies
who participates in the 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is terminated and
who elects such direct rollover in accordance with the terms of the 401(k)
Plan and the Code. The Acquired Companies and Parent shall take any and all
actions necessary to permit each employee of the Acquired Companies with an
outstanding loan balance under the 401(k) Plan as of the date such plan is
terminated to continue to make scheduled loan payments to the 401(k) Plan
after the Closing, pending the distribution and in-kind rollover of the
promissory notes evidencing such loans from the 401(k) Plan to the Parent
401(k) Plan, as provided in the preceding sentence, such as to prevent, to the
extent reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect
to such outstanding loans.

 



 

(f) Each individual who (i) is employed by an Acquired Company immediately
prior to the Closing and participates in the annual bonus plan maintained by
the Company with respect to the Companys 2018 fiscal year (the " _2018 Bonus
Plan_ ") and (ii) has not received payment in full in respect of the 2018
Bonus Plan prior to the Closing (each, a " _Bonus Eligible Individual_ ")
shall be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment from the Company equal to
100% of the Bonus Eligible Individuals target annual cash bonus amount under
the 2018 Bonus Plan (the " _2018 Bonus Payments_ "). The 2018 Bonus Payments
shall be made to the Bonus Eligible Individuals, less applicable withholding
Taxes, no later than the first regular payroll date of the Company following
the Closing Date; provided that if the first regular payroll date is less than
five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, such payments shall occur
no later than the second regular payroll date of the Company following the
Effective Time. _Section 6.11(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains
a true and complete list of the 2018 Bonus Payments, which the Company agrees
to update to the extent necessary at Closing.

 



 

(g) If the employment of any Company Employee is terminated on or before the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date as a result of a termination
by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates for any reason other
than for cause (as determined by Parent in accordance with past practice),
such terminated Company Employee shall receive severance payments and benefits
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those that would have been
provided to such Company Employee under the Companys severance practices set
forth in _Section 6.11(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(h) To the extent that (x) any "disqualified individuals" (as such term is
defined for purposes of Section 280G of the Code) (each, a " _Disqualified
Individual_ ") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to
any payment or benefit as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (y) such payment or benefit would, or could reasonably be
expected to, constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code,
the Company shall: (i) seek written waivers by such Disqualified Individuals
of any portion of such parachute payment as exceeds (x) three times such
individuals "base amount" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the
Code less (y) one dollar (collectively, the " _Excess_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Parachute Payments_ ") to the extent such Excess Parachute Payments are not
subsequently approved pursuant to a stockholder vote in accordance with the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and Treasury Regulations
section 1.280G-1 thereunder (the " _280G Stockholder Approval Requirements_
"); and (ii) seek stockholder approval in a manner intended to satisfy the
280G Stockholder Approval Requirements in respect of the Excess Parachute
Payments payable to any such Disqualified Individual. At least five (5)
Business Days prior to obtaining such waivers and seeking stockholder
approval, the Company shall provide drafts of the waivers and all stockholder
approval materials to Parent for its review and comment and shall consider
such comments in good faith. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent evidence that a vote of the applicable Companys
stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions and
that either (a) the requisite number of stockholder votes was obtained, or (b)
that the requisite number of stockholder votes was not obtained and no waived
parachute payments shall be made.

 



 

(i) Nothing contained herein is intended (i) to confer upon any Person,
including any current or former employee of any Acquired Company or their
dependents or beneficiaries, any separate right to employment or continued
employment with any Acquired Company or its Affiliates, or any benefit under
any Company Benefit Plan or New Benefit Plan, or (ii) to constitute an
employee benefit plan or an amendment to an employee benefit plan or prohibit
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any employee
benefit plan.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform when due its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

one hand, and each of the Persons listed on the signature pages thereto
holding at least 70% of the Closing Stock Consideration in the aggregate,
including all Dragging Holders, on the other hand, shall duly execute and
deliver to the other the Registration Rights Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Preservation of Books and Records_.

 



 

(a) For the period ending upon the later of (i) seven (7) years from the end
of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs and (ii) the expiration of
any applicable statute of limitations, including any extensions thereof (the "
_Information Maintenance Period_ "):

 



 

(i) Parent shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Companies not to, dispose
of or destroy any of the books and records of the Acquired Companies (" _Books
and Records_ ");

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) Parent shall allow, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to allow, the
Holder Representative and its Representatives access to all Books and Records
on reasonable notice and at reasonable times in connection with any claim,
proceeding or other investigation by a Governmental Entity, any claim by or
against a third party or any other proper purpose at Parents principal place
of business or at any other reasonable location where any Books and Records
are stored, and the Holder Representative shall have the right, at its sole
cost and expense, to make copies of any such Books and Records; _provided_

liabilities, suits, judgments, damages, actions and causes of action,

at Law or in equity that such Party ever had, now has or ever may have or
claim to have against any Released Party, for or by reason of any matter,
circumstance, event, action, inaction, omission, cause or thing whatsoever
arising prior to the Closing; _provided_ that, this release (a) does not
extend to claims relating to any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or
any of the provisions set forth herein and (b) shall not affect any
employment-related matters or matters affecting any Company stockholder in his
or her capacity as a manager, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Parent acknowledges that the Company stockholders will be
relying on the waiver provided hereby in connection with providing the Company
Stockholder Approval and that this _Section 6.19_ is intended for the benefit
of, and to grant third party rights to the Company stockholders to enforce
this _Section 6.19_.

 



 

Section 6.20 _No Solicitation_. From the date hereof and prior to the earlier

terms, the Company shall not, nor shall the Company authorize or permit any of

Parent) concerning any merger, consolidation, sale of equity, sale of material
assets or similar transactions involving (directly or indirectly) any Acquired
Company or the business of the Acquired Companies (each such acquisition
transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "). The Company shall notify
Parent promptly (but in any case within two (2) Business Days) after receipt
by any Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates or Representatives of
any information relating to a possible Acquisition Transaction or any request
for information in connection with an Acquisition Transaction or for access to
the properties, books or records, non-public information, directors,
employees, officers or advisors of any Acquired Company by any Person that
informs any Acquired Company or their respective Affiliates or Representatives
that it is considering proposing, or has proposed, an Acquisition Transaction.
The Company shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations by
any of them or their respective Affiliates or Representatives with any Persons
(other than Parent) conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Transaction and request from each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement with any Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished to such Person or its Representatives and
terminate access by each such Person and its Representatives to any online or

commercially reasonable efforts to liquidate or otherwise dissolve its dormant
Subsidiaries, Crystal Merger Sub, Inc. and Global Multi Services, S.A., prior

Section 6.23 _Tax Cooperation_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate in good faith, and take all steps as reasonably necessary in
connection therewith, to consider commercially reasonable alternative
acquisition structures pursuant to which Parent may acquire the business of
the Acquired Companies, including without limitation an election under
Sections 338(g) or 338(h)(10) of the Code, in order to most effectively (i)
reduce contingent liabilities, (ii) minimize any negative or punitive tax
implications and (iii) maximize any tax benefits, in each case in order to
provide a more economically beneficial result for the Parties. Such good
faith negotiation shall include mutual cooperation and sharing of information
with respect to tax matters and entering into an amendment to this Agreement
to the extent necessary to effectuate such alternative structure; _provided_
that nothing contained in this _Section 6.23_ shall require the Companys
cooperation to the extent such cooperation is inconsistent with its
obligations under _Section 6.4(a)_ hereof, would be unduly burdensome, would
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or would be
reasonably likely to increase the amount of Taxes due and owing by the
Holders, as determined by the Holders in their reasonable discretion, under
the acquisition structure contemplated by this Agreement on the date hereof.
Any additional Taxes, costs, expenses, liabilities, losses or other
obligations incurred in connection with the Companys performance of its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.23_, including considering,
evaluating or effectuating an alternative structure (collectively, "
_Alternative Structure Losses_ "), as compared to effectuating the acquisition
structure contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and subject to the
conditions on the date hereof, shall be borne by Parent, and Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Holders from and against all such Alternative
Structure Losses.

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Termination_. Anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary

herein may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) by the mutual consent of the Company and Parent;

(i) if the Merger shall not have occurred on or prior to 11:59 P.M. (New York
City Time) on November 18, 2018; _provided_ that, if the Closing has not
occurred due to the failure of the Parties to satisfy the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ (in the event the applicable Law,

Laws), _Section 7.2(c)_, _Section 7.2(d)_ or the requirements of _Section

comply with their respective obligations set forth in _Section 6.5_, by such

further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any Party whose material breach of this

(ii) if any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub shall have enforced, enacted or entered any Law, judgment,
order, decree, injunction or ruling or taken any other action, in each case,
such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ would not be satisfied,
and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
non-

 



      
 

 



 

appealable, unless the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ (x) has breached its obligations under _Section
6.5_ or (y) is otherwise in material breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) by the Company:

 



 

(i) upon a material breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent
or Merger Sub, or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
shall be untrue, in any case such that the conditions set forth in _Section
7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied (assuming that the date of
such determination is the Closing Date); _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ shall not be
available to the Company if it has failed to perform in any material respect
any of its obligations under or in connection with this Agreement or is in
breach of any representation or warranty such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2(a)_ would not be satisfied (assuming that the date of such
determination is the Closing Date).

 



 

(d) by Parent:

 



 

(i) upon a material breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company, or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall be untrue,

_Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied (assuming that the date of such
determination is the Closing Date); _provided_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ shall not be available to
Parent if it has failed to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations under or in connection with this Agreement or is in breach of any
representation or warranty such that the conditions set forth in _Section
7.3(a)_ would not be satisfied (assuming that the date of such determination
is the Closing Date);

 



 

(ii) upon issuance of a non-appealable order, injunction, decree, ruling,
divestiture requirement or other action taken by a Governmental Entity under
Antitrust Laws which would have a Regulatory Adverse Effect; or

 



 

(iii) if the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ has not been satisfied
within twenty-four (24) hours after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made (other than in the case of termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1(a)_). Upon payment of the required fee referred to in _Section
8.2(b)_, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, and there shall
be no damages or liability except for fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation in the making of the respective representations and
warranties set forth herein (as qualified by the

 



       
 

 



 

Company Disclosure Letter) or a knowing or intentional breach of this
Agreement on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective
directors, officers, employees, stockholders, Representatives, agents or
advisors, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 6.6(a)_, this
_Section 8.2_ and _Article IX_ shall survive such termination. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that damages or liability for fraud, willful misconduct
or intentional misrepresentation in the making of the respective
representations and warranties set forth herein (as qualified by the Company
Disclosure Letter) or a knowing or intentional breach of this Agreement shall
not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may
include the benefit of the bargain lost by (i) the Company or its stockholders
(taking into consideration relevant matters, including the total amount
payable to such stockholders under this Agreement and the time value of
money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of the Company or
(ii) Parent, as applicable.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated (i) by the Company
or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ due to the failure of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ (in the event the applicable Law,
judgment, order, decree, injunction or ruling has been issued under Antitrust
Laws), _Section 7.2(c)_ or _Section 7.2(d)_ to be satisfied, (ii) by the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ (in the event the
applicable Law, judgment, order, decree, injunction, ruling or other action
has been issued or was taken under Antitrust Laws), or (iii) by Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, then, in each case, Parent shall, within
two (2) Business Days following any such termination, pay (or cause to be
paid) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by the Company a termination fee equal to Thirty Five Million U.S. Dollars
($35,000,000) in cash (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "). Parent acknowledges
that the agreement contained in this _Section 8.2_ is an integral part of
this Agreement and that, without this _Section 8.2_, the Company would not
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly pay
any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_, Parent shall pay to the
Company all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including
reasonable attorneys fees as well as reasonable expenses incurred), together
with interest on the amount of the Parent Termination Fee at the prime lending
rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such
payment is required to be made. For the avoidance of any doubt, while the
Company may pursue both (i) a grant of specific performance in accordance with
_Section 9.12_ and (ii) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under this
_Section 8.2(b)_, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the type
contemplated by _Section 9.12_ and the Parent Termination Fee.

(including the Company Disclosure Letter and the exhibits and instruments
referred to herein),

 



      
 

 



 

the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Stockholder Consent and Support
Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and (b) are not intended to confer upon
any Person other than the Parties any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations
or liabilities hereunder, except for (i) the rights of the Holders to receive
the Per Share Final Merger Consideration following the Effective Time in
accordance with _Article III_, (ii) the right of the Company, on behalf of
the Holders, to pursue damages in the event of Parents or Merger Subs fraud
or knowing or intentional breach of this Agreement, which right is hereby

loss of the economic and bargain benefits of the Merger to the Companys
stockholders based on the consideration that would have otherwise been payable

6.9_ (which is intended for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties, all of

_Section 9.11_, _Section 9.13_ or _Section 9.19_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Lenders and the Financing
Sources.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Merger is
fulfilled to the extent possible.

Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement hereof or thereof, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of

Section 9.10 _Service of Process_. Each Party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred
to in _Section 9.9_ in any such action or proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby by mailing copies thereof by
registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to
its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 9.3_. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a Party to effect service of process on
the other Party by any other legally available method.

 



 

Section 9.11 _No Recourse; Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement or otherwise, the Parties agree on their own
behalf and on behalf of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates that (a)
this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim for breach of this
Agreement may only be made against, the Parties and then only with respect to
the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party and (b)
with respect to each Party, no past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, advisor, Lender, Financing Source, Representative or agent of such
named Party shall have any liability (whether in contract or tort, at law or
in equity or otherwise, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
liability of an entity Party against its owners or Affiliates) for any one or
more of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or liabilities of such named Party or for

 



      
 

 



 

any claim based on, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, (i) the Company (on behalf of itself and its officers,
directors, employees, agents, Affiliates and Representatives) hereby waives
any rights or claims, whether at law or at equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the Parties hereby agree that the
Financing Sources shall not have any liability (whether in contract or in
tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by statute or otherwise) for any
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions and judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind arising under this
Agreement (provided that nothing in this _Section 9.11_ shall limit the
liability or obligations of the Financing Sources to Parent (and its
successors and assigns) and/or the other parties to the Commitment Letter
under the Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements).

 



 

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any Party to
perform its agreements and covenants hereunder, including its failure to take
all actions as are necessary on its part to consummate the Merger, will cause
irreparable injury to the non-breaching Parties, for which damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party hereby
consents to the granting of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction to prevent breaches of this Agreement, to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof, and to compel performance of such Partys
obligations (including the taking of such actions as are required of such
Party to consummate the Merger), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which any Party is entitled under this Agreement. The Parties further agree to
waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with any such remedy, and that such remedy shall be in addition to any other
remedy to which a Party is entitled at Law or in equity. In circumstances
where Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Merger and the
Merger has not been consummated, Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge
and agree that the Company and its stockholders shall have suffered
irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate the
Company and its stockholders, and that the Company on behalf of itself and its
stockholders shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be
available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to
enforce specifically Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the
Merger. The Companys pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be
deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other
right or remedy to which the Company may be entitled, including the right to
pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by the Company
and its stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Closing does not
occur due to termination pursuant to _Article VIII_ which results in the
payment of a Parent Termination Fee under _Section 8.2(b)_, the payment of
such Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives against Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives and under no circumstances shall the Company, its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Affiliates and Representatives be permitted or
entitled to receive a grant of specific performance.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
the provisions of _Section 8.2(b)_, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the

 



      
 

 



 

Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent and/or
Merger Sub to draw down the full proceeds of the Financing pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements and
to cause Parent and/or Merger Sub to effect the Closing in accordance with
_Section 2.3_, in each case, if and only if (i) all conditions set forth in
_Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than
those to be satisfied at the Closing itself, each of which is capable of
being, and is, satisfied or waived upon the Closing) at the time when the
Closing would have occurred pursuant to the terms hereof and remain satisfied
or waived, and (ii) the Company has confirmed in a written notice delivered to
Parent that (A) all conditions set forth in _Section 7.3_ have been satisfied
(other than those to be satisfied at the Closing itself, each of which is
capable of being, and is, satisfied upon the Closing) or that it is willing to
waive any unsatisfied conditions in _Section 7.3_ at the Closing and (B) if
specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded then the Closing
will occur.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties; _provided_ that, Parent may assign its rights
and interests (but not its obligations) hereunder to any Financing Source, as
collateral for security purposes, in connection with the Financing without
prior written consent. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without
relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 9.14 _Expenses_. Subject to _Section 6.6_, _Section 6.7_ and the
last sentence of _Section 6.23_, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such
costs and expenses, whether or not the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby is consummated; _provided_ that (a) Parent shall be
responsible for all filing fees and filing expenses payable in connection with
any filings or submissions under the Competition Act and any other Antitrust
Laws, and (b) Parent shall be responsible for, and shall promptly pay, all
fees and expenses incurred by the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and its
and their respective Representatives in connection with any tax reform
analysis, earnings and profits studies, evaluation of intercompany balances
and external debt wind-down, tax integration planning, Section 338 of the Code
analysis, Section 382 of the Code analysis, and any other integration
activities requested by Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than such
filing fees and submission expenses set forth in clause (a) of the immediately
preceding sentence, each Party shall pay is own legal fees and other expenses
in connection with obtaining Competition Act Clearance to the extent incurred
prior to Closing.

 



 

Section 9.15 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall indemnify the Company and its Representatives (each a "
_Company Indemnified Party_ "), and shall hold each of them harmless from and
against, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties,
judgments, interest, awards, fines, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements, costs of investigation, defense costs and
costs of enforcing any right of indemnification in this _Section 9.15_)
(collectively, " _Damages_ ") that are incurred or suffered by such Company
Indemnified Party as a result of, or arising from or in connection with, (i)
any written request of any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Law in
connection with the consummation of the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Damages resulting from the
violation of any Antitrust Law in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) any Antitrust Proceeding. For the
avoidance of doubt, Damages shall not include special, exemplary, punitive,
diminution in value, loss of profits or consequential damages or legal fees
incurred in connection with any filings or submissions under the Competition
Act and any other Antitrust Laws prior to Closing.

 



 

(b) Any Company Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
give written notice to Parent of any claim made by any third party against
such Company Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") for Damages that
may be subject to indemnification promptly after learning of such Third Party
Claim, which notice must specify in reasonable detail the nature of such Third
Party Claim and be accompanied by a copy, if any, of the applicable written
notice made by such third party to the Company Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
that the Companys failure to provide or delay in providing such notice shall
not in any way effect Parents indemnification obligations under this _Section
9.15_ except to the extent Parent is materially prejudiced thereby. If the
Third Party Claim falls within the scope of the indemnification obligations of
_Section 9.15(a)_, Parent shall have the right, upon giving written notice to
the Company Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
(including to conduct and control any Antitrust Proceedings or settlement
negotiations) with counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and expense.
The Company Indemnified Party shall cooperate with Parent in such defense. The
Company Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense
of any Third Party Claim and to employ its own counsel (it being understood
that Parent shall control such defense), at its own cost and expense. Whether
or not Parent assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, neither Parent nor
the Company shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise
or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the other Partys prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Regardless of which Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Parties agree to cooperate in good faith and in all respects with one
another and each others Representatives (including counsel) in connection
with the investigation, negotiation, settlement, trial and/or defense of any
Third Party Claim and any related proceeding or appeal arising therefrom. Such
cooperation shall include providing records and information that are relevant
to such Third Party Claim, and making employees and officers reasonably
available on a mutually convenient basis during normal business hours upon
reasonable advance notice to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder and to act as a witness or respond to legal
process. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in any notifications to
and information requests of any insurers.

 



 

Section 9.16 _Section 338 Election_. Except as otherwise agreed to by the
Parties pursuant to the terms and conditions of _Section 6.23_ hereof,
neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any Affiliate or Subsidiary thereof shall make
or file an election under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar provision of
the Law of any state or other taxing jurisdiction) with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.17 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any of the Parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the Party or Parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written

 



      
 

 



 

instrument signed by the Party granting such waiver, but such waiver or
failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 



 

Section 9.18 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher and Flom LLP (" _SASM andF_") has acted as legal counsel to the Company
and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and that SASMandF may act as legal
counsel to certain of the Companys stockholders after the Closing, each of
the Parent and the Surviving Corporation (including the Surviving
Corporations Subsidiaries) hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to
cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with
SASMandF representing any Company stockholder and/or its Affiliates after the
Closing as such representation may relate to the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated herein. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client
confidences between SASMandF and the Company or any Company stockholder or their
respective Affiliates in the course of the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Company, such
stockholder and their respective Affiliates (and not to the Surviving
Corporation). Accordingly, the Surviving Corporation shall not have access to
any such communications, or to the files of SASMandF relating to the engagement,
whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) the Company, the
applicable stockholder and their respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to
the extent that files of SASMandF in respect of such engagement constitute
property of the client, only the Company, the applicable stockholder and their
respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and (iii) SASMandF shall have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications
or files to any of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between SASMandF and the Company, the
applicable stockholder and their respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries and a third
party (other than a Party to this Agreement or any of their respective
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation (including on behalf
of its Subsidiaries) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by SASMandF to such third party;
_provided_ , that neither Surviving Corporation nor any of its Subsidiaries
may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
stockholders.

 



 

Section 9.19 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF, INCLUDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THE COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE FINANCING OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY LENDER OR FINANCING

 



      
 

 



 

SOURCE, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. EACH OF THE PARTIES CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.19_.
