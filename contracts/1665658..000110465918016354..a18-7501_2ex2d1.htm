withdrawn or otherwise lost such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL.
If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (by the holder
thereof effectively withdrawing, failing to perfect, or otherwise losing such
holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares), then,
as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such
shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.6(b)_, without interest, and shall not thereafter be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) written notice of any demand or threatened
demand for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock received by the
Company, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity
and right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands under the DGCL consistent with the obligations of the
Company thereunder. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. From and after

exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the
Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select an
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates and Book Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration. Parent will
make available to the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, cash
in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.6(b)_, which shall not include, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares or, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Stock Option Merger Consideration, the Restricted Stock Merger
Consideration or the RSU Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of a Certificate (other than Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares who have not subsequently withdrawn or lost their rights of
appraisal) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent or by appropriate guarantee of delivery in the form customarily
used in transactions of this nature from a member of a national securities
exchange, a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or a
commercial

 



      
 

 



 

bank or trust company in the United States) for use in effecting delivery of
shares to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender
of Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration issuable and payable
in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that
have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section 2.6(b)_, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or upon
receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) with respect
to the exchange of Book Entry Shares, will be entitled to receive an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.6_ and _Article II_. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or Book
Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, each Certificate and Book Entry Share
shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to
receive such Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Certificate Holder_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment
thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Dissenting Shares), subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay dividends or make any other distributions with a record date
prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company
on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at
the Effective Time and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to

benefit to any current or former employee, officer, individual service
provider or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) trigger
any payment for funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits under, or (iii) increase the amount payable or trigger any other

all right, title, and interest in and to, or have sufficient rights to use,
all Intellectual Property material to the conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted (collectively, " _Company
Intellectual Property_ "), free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than

material respect, the Intellectual Property of any other Person that is
material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is used in connection with its or
their business as operated as of the date hereof is subject to any "open
source," "copyleft" or analogous license (including any license approved by
the Open Source Initiative and listed at http://www.opensource.org/licenses,
GPL, AGPL or other open source software license) in a manner or relation which
has or would require any public distribution of any such software (including
in source code form), create obligations for the Company to grant, or purport
to grant, to any third party any rights or immunities under any Intellectual
Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any patent
non-asserts or patent licenses), or impose any economic limitations on the
Companys or its Subsidiaries commercial exploitation thereof.

 



 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have not been subject to any Action by
any Governmental Authority or any Person regarding any offense or alleged
offense under applicable Laws relating to data collection, use, privacy,

threatened. Since January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
have experienced any security breach, theft, or unauthorized disclosure in

 



      
 

 



 

which confidential or protected information, such as payment card data,
personally identifiable information or other legally protected information
relating to individuals, in each case that is processed or stored by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, was or may have been
improperly accessed by an unauthorized outside Person or improperly disclosed
and such access or disclosure would be reasonably likely to result in material
liability to the Company, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notices from any Person with respect thereto.

 



 

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company

Financing needed to pay the Required Amount will not be available to Parent or
Merger Sub on or prior to the Closing Date for purposes of paying the Required

will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of the directors,
officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, and shall

terminated, any and all existing activities, discussions, information sharing,

cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, and shall not authorize or
permit any of the foregoing to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or

the Company shall simultaneously provide Parent with a copy of any such
communications.

 



 

(b) _Unsolicited Alternative Transaction Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in _Section 5.2(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
in the event that the Company receives after the date of this Agreement and
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, an unsolicited bona fide
written Alternative Transaction Proposal (which Alternative Transaction
Proposal did not, directly or indirectly, result from or arise out of a
material breach of this _Section 5.2_) that (x) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) to be, or to be reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, and (y) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company and its
Representatives may then take the following actions:

 



 

(i) furnish any nonpublic information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, the Person or group (and their respective Representatives)
making such Alternative Transaction Proposal and afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books and records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that prior to furnishing any such information, it
receives from such Person or group an executed confidentiality agreement
containing confidentiality terms at least as restrictive and at least as
favorable to the Company as the terms contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (other than _de minimis_ differences) and which shall not prohibit
or conflict with any obligation herein (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "); _provided further_ , that the Company (A) will not, and will
not permit its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, furnish any
nonpublic information to any Person or group who has made, or which would
reasonably be expected to make, an Alternative Transaction Proposal or Inquiry
except pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; and (B) the
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to not, provide any commercially sensitive
nonpublic information to any competitor in connection with the actions
permitted by this _Section 5.2(b)_, except in a manner consistent with the
Companys past practices in dealing with the disclosure of such information in
the context of considering Alternative Transaction Proposals prior to the date
of this Agreement (which information shall

 



      
 

 



 

simultaneously be provided to Parent and its Representatives to the extent
such information has not previously been made available to Parent or its
Representatives); and

 



 

(ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group (and
their Representatives) with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

 



 

(c) _Notification_. In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
_Section 5.2(a)_, _Section 5.2(b)_, _Section 5.2(d)_ and _Section 5.2(e)_
hereof, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) following receipt of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any
proposal, offer or credible inquiry with respect to, or which could reasonably
likely lead to, any Alternative Transaction Proposal or any requests for
nonpublic information from, or any discussions or negotiations being sought to
be initiated or continued with, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
Representatives (any of the foregoing, an " _Inquiry_ "), the Company shall
provide Parent with written notice of such Alternative Transaction Proposal or
Inquiry, which notice shall include a written summary of the material terms
and conditions thereof and copies of any proposed material written agreements
or material correspondence exchanged between the Person (or its
Representatives) making an Alternative Transaction Proposal or Inquiry and the
Company (or its Representatives). In addition, the Company shall provide
Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) with (A) all information, material developments, discussions or
negotiations, in each case, as reasonably necessary to keep Parent reasonably
currently informed of all written or material oral communications regarding,
and the status of, and any material developments regarding, any such
Alternative Transaction Proposal or Inquiry and (B) all material nonpublic
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to the Person
making such Alternative Transaction Proposal or Inquiry which was not
previously provided to Parent or its Representatives.

 



 

(d) _Changes of Recommendation_. Neither the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) withhold,
withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in any manner adverse to Parent) or
publicly propose to withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in any manner
adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors or any committee thereof of this
Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), (B) recommend, adopt or approve,
or publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative
Transaction Proposal, (C) following a publicly announced tender or exchange
offer for any Company Common Stock, fail to recommend against acceptance of
any tender offer or exchange offer for the shares of the Company Common Stock
within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of such offer or, if earlier,
within five (5) Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting
(which reaffirmation is not subsequently withdrawn or modified), (D) fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (E) fail to
publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days
after receipt of a written request by Parent to provide such affirmation if an
Alternative Transaction Proposal or Inquiry (or any modification thereto)
shall have become publicly known or upon any one other request by Parent, or
(F) resolve or publicly propose to take any action described in the foregoing
clauses (A) through (E) (any action described in the foregoing clauses (A)
through (F) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_
"); or (ii) except as provided herein, approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or

 



      
 

 



 

any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding (x)
constituting, or providing for, any Alternative Transaction Proposal or (y)
requiring it (or that would require it) to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Superior Proposals; Intervening Events; Termination_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 5.2(d)_ or in any other
provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, (A) solely in response to either (x) an Intervening
Event or (y) a Superior Proposal received after the date hereof, the Board of
Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if
the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (B) solely in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ and substantially concurrently
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), if, in the case of either clause (A) or
(B):

 



 

(i) in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal has been made
and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal, and such
Superior Proposal did not, directly or indirectly, result from or arise out of
a breach of this _Section 5.2_);

 



 

(ii) the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained;

 



 

(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that,
in light of such Intervening Event or Superior Proposal, as applicable, the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, solely in response
to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement and enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, would reasonably
be likely to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 



 

(iv) the Company shall have (1) provided Parent four (4) Business Days prior
written notice (such period of time, the " _Company Notice Period_ "), which
notice shall state (x) that the Company has received a Superior Proposal or
there has been an Intervening Event, (y) (I) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the material terms of such Superior Proposal (including the identity
of the party making such Superior Proposal), and which notice shall include a
copy of all relevant transaction documents with respect thereto (including an
acquisition agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal) or (II) in the
case of an Intervening Event, the facts underlying the determination by the
Company Board that an Intervening Event has occurred, in reasonable detail,
and (z) that in response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event the
Company intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or, solely in
response to a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement and enter into a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, and, in
either case, specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor (a "
_Company Notice_ "), (2) to the extent requested by Parent, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Parent during the Company Notice Period to amend this
Agreement and the other transaction

 



      
 

 



 

documents contemplated herein as would enable the Board of Directors to
maintain the Company Recommendation and not make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement, (3) considered in good
faith any bona fide offer made by Parent to the Company during the Company
Notice Period, and (4) following the expiration of the Company Notice Period
and any negotiations with, or consideration of any bona fide offers (including
any amendments, modifications or changes to this Agreement and the other
transaction documents contemplated herein) made by, Parent during the Company
Notice Period, the Board of Directors of the Company again makes the
determination set forth in _Section 5.2(e)(iii)_, it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of
the Superior Proposal, or any material changes in or developments regarding
the facts and circumstances relating to the Intervening Event, shall require
the Company to deliver a new Company Notice and again comply with the
requirements set forth in this _Section 5.2(e)_ (except that any subsequent
Company Notice Period shall be two (2) Business Days); and

 



 

(v) none of the Company, the Board of Directors or any committee thereof shall
enter into any agreement with any Person to limit or not to give prior notice
to Parent of its intention to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
or to terminate this Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) _Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the
Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to Company
Stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer) with respect to an Alternative Transaction Proposal or (ii)
making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ however, that,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and its Board of Directors may not
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted
by _Section 5.2(e)_.

 



 

(g) _Standstill Agreements_. The Company agrees not to release or permit the
release of any Person from, or to waive or permit the waiver or termination of
any provision of, any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement (or any
standstill or confidentiality provision of any other Contract or agreement) to
which any of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party or any
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price," "interested
stockholder," "affiliate transaction," "business combination," or other
antitakeover applicable Law, and the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law each such agreement.

 



 

Section 5.3 _SEC Documents; Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) _Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, and in any event
within twenty (20) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, a preliminary
form of the Proxy Statement. Parent shall provide to the Company all
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates as may be reasonably necessary in connection with the preparation
and

 



      
 

 



 

filing of the Proxy Statement and any other filings required to be made with
the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC. The Company shall promptly resolve and respond to any comments in respect
thereof received by the SEC, and Parent shall cooperate with the Company to
the extent necessary to respond to and resolve such comments. The Company will
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to Company Stockholders as soon as
practicable (but in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days) following (i)
the completion of any review or clearance (including deemed clearance) by the
SEC or (ii) the expiration of the ten (10) day period after the filing of the
preliminary Proxy Statement in the event the SEC does not affirmatively notify
the Company during such period that it will or will not be reviewing the Proxy
Statement (the first to occur, the " _SEC Clearance Date_ " as the same may be
amended in the event that any additional review or clearance by the SEC is
required following the occurrence of an SEC Clearance Date). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event (1) the Company has not mailed, and was not
reasonably able to mail, the Proxy Statement by July 27, 2018 and (2) the
Marketing Period has not commenced by July 30, 2018, the Company will not be
required to mail the Proxy Statement sooner than August 29, 2018 unless, on or
after July 30, 2018 and prior to August 29, 2018, Parent provides notice to
the Company that it has determined in its sole discretion to eliminate in its
entirety, to terminate early or to reduce the total number of consecutive
Business Days required for the completion of the Marketing Period such that
the Marketing Period could be completed no less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the date the Company Stockholders Meeting will be held if the Proxy
Statement is mailed within ten (10) business days thereafter (the Marketing
Period, modified for such reduced number of Business Days, the " _Reduced
Marketing Period_ ") (such condition, a " _Mailing Acceleration Event_ ").
Upon the occurrence of a Mailing Acceleration Event, the Company will cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Stockholders as soon as
practicable, but in any event no later than the later of ten (10) Business
Days following (x) the Mailing Acceleration Event or (y) the SEC Clearance
Date.

 



 

(ii) All filings by the Company with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and all mailings to the Company Stockholders
in connection with the Merger and transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be subject to the prior review and reasonable comment by Parent (which
comments shall be considered by the Company in good faith) and the Company
shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity and time period to review
and comment on all such filings.

 



 

(iii) The Company shall (A) as promptly as practicable notify Parent of (1)
the receipt of any comments or requests from the SEC, its staff or any other
government officials and all other written correspondence and oral
communications with the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement or any filings by
the Company with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and (2) any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplements to the
Proxy Statement or any filings by the Company with the SEC in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or for additional information with
respect thereto and (B) supply Parent with copies of all correspondence and
communications between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) The Company shall ensure that (i) none of the information supplied,
included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement (other than
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent) will, at the time the Proxy
Statement is first mailed to the Company Stockholders and at the time of the
meeting of Company Stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"),
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
Parent shall ensure that none of the information supplied by or on its behalf
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at
the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company Stockholders and
at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.

 



 

(v) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors
or officers is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub which is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

 



 

(b) _Company Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(i) The Company shall duly give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting (with the record date and meeting date set in reasonable
consultation with Parent) as promptly as practicable following the mailing of
the Proxy Statement (but in any event within thirty (30) days after the
mailing of the Proxy Statement) to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of
seeking the Company Stockholder Approval (or following the adjournment of the
Company Stockholders Meeting under certain circumstances) and, unless the
Board of Directors has enacted a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event or Superior Proposal in accordance with (and
after satisfying all requirements and obligations set forth in) _Section
5.2(e)_, shall (A) recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement
and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and (B) use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit such adoption and obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company may only adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting (x) to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders
in advance of a vote on the adoption of this Agreement (y), if, as of the time
for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting or (z) as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable Law;
_provided_ , that in the case of any of clause (x), (y), or (z), the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall only be adjourned or postponed for a minimum
period of time reasonable under the circumstances (it being

 



      
 

 



 

understood that any such adjournment or postponement shall not affect the
Companys obligation to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance
with this _Section 5.3(b)_). For the avoidance of doubt, unless this
Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article VII_, the Company shall
establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL, whether or not the Board of
Directors at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other
than adjournment and similar procedural matters) which the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the Companys stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders
Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited
in compliance with applicable Law, the rules of NASDAQ and the Company Charter
and the Company Bylaws. Beginning on the day that is ten (10) Business Days
prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting and until the Company
Stockholders Meeting is held, the Company shall, upon the reasonable request
of Parent, advise Parent as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the
Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval and the votes to be
made thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Companys obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.3(b)(i)_ (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, are subject to _Section 5.2(e)_) shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Alternative Transaction Proposal or by a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with _Section 7.1(c)(i)_.

 



 

(ii) Except to the extent expressly permitted by _Section 5.2(e)_, (A) the
Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend that its stockholders vote
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders
Meeting and (B) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect
that the Board of Directors of the Company has recommended that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable prior notice and subject to
applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and each of its and its Subsidiaries
officers, directors and employees to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to, afford Parent and its officers,
directors, employees and Representatives, following notice from Parent in
accordance with this _Section 5.4_, reasonable access during normal business
hours to officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities, books and records of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
all other financial, operating and other data and information as shall be
reasonably requested and, during such period shall furnish, and shall cause to
be furnished, as promptly as reasonably practicable, a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or received pursuant to the requirements of
the federal securities laws or a Governmental Authority, except, with respect
to examination reports, as may be restricted by applicable Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to disclose
any information

 



       
 

 



 

that, in its good faith determination, (i) it is not legally permitted to
disclose or the disclosure of which would contravene any applicable Law or
Order or (ii) the disclosure of which would be reasonably likely to cause the
loss or waiver of any attorney-client or other legal privilege or trade secret
protection; _provided_ that, the Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable description of such information and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to disclose such information, or a portion thereof, without
contravening such applicable Law or Order or losing or waiving any attorney-
client privilege or trade secret protection. The Company shall be entitled to
have Representatives present at all times during any such inspection, and all
inspections granted pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall be subject to the
Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements. No
investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ or information provided, made
available or delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ or otherwise shall
affect any representations or warranties or conditions or rights contained in
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Limitations_. The Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this _Section 5.4_ or _Section 5.5_ as "outside counsel only".
Such material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of Parent and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of Parent unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the Company or its legal counsel.

 



 

(c) _Conduct of Business_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall give Parent or any of its Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or its
Subsidiaries business or operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, maintain and exercise complete control and supervision over
the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) _Confidentiality_. All information and materials provided by the Company
to Parent pursuant to this Agreement will be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which will remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) _Governmental and Third Party Approvals_. Each of the parties shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make

for, in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of directors and officers and advancement of fees,
costs and expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries
than the corresponding provisions in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws,
each as in effect on the date hereof. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to honor and comply with their respective obligations under any
indemnification agreement with any present and former directors and officers
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") in
effect as of the date hereof, and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such agreement in any manner that would materially adversely affect any
indemnification right of any Indemnified Person thereunder.

 



 

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, as of the Effective Time, to
obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"),
which DandO Insurance shall (i) be for a claims reporting or discovery period of
at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim
related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) be from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance and (iii) have terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to
any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against an Indemnified
Person by reason of his or her having served in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place with the Companys current
insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the Companys
current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
as provided in the Companys existing policies; _provided_ that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300%
of the premium amount per annum for the Companys existing policies; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be

 



      
 

 



 

obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

 



 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.7_. The obligations of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any successors or assigns under this _Section 5.7_ shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective
Time (or if later the expiration of all statutes of limitations applicable to
any such claim); _provided_ , that if any claim (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) is brought against an Indemnified Person on or prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
_Section 5.7_ shall continue in effect solely with respect to such
Indemnified Person until the full and final resolution of such claim.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with
each other before issuing, and will provide each other the opportunity to
review and reasonably comment upon, and use reasonable best efforts to agree
on, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), except as either party, after consultation with
outside counsel, may determine (x) is required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or stock market if it has used reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other party prior thereto regarding the timing, scope and
content of any such press release or public statement and (y) that making
further attempts for consultation would reasonably be likely to result in a
violation of such Law, court process or obligation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such consultation shall be required to make any disclosure or
otherwise take any action expressly permitted by _Section 5.2_. In addition,
except (i) to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Proxy Statement
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.3_, (ii) to the extent
necessary to comply with the Companys periodic reporting obligations under
the Exchange Act, (iii) for any consent given in accordance with this _Section
5.8_ or (iv) as expressly permitted by _Section 5.2_, neither party shall
issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure
concerning the other party or the other partys business, financial condition
or results of operations without the consent of such other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be in the form agreed to by the
parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the issuance of any press
release or the making of any public statement with respect to which the
consultation procedures set forth in this _Section 5.8_ have been followed,
either party may issue such additional publications or press releases and make
such other customary announcements without consulting with any other party
hereto so long as such additional publications, press releases and
announcements do not disclose any non-public information regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement beyond the scope of, and are
reasonably consistent in tone and tenor with, the disclosure included in the
press release or public statement with respect to which the other party had
been consulted.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.9 _Certain Tax Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company

corresponding notice to the IRS, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and Merger Sub and that complies with the requirements set forth in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2), to the effect that interests in

executed and filed notice provided to Parent and Merger Sub.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date (or, if shorter,
the period of employment of the relevant Company Employee), the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing who
remain employed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately following the Closing (the " _Company Employees_ ") shall receive
(i) annual base salary or wages (which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes
incentive compensation whether payable in cash or equity), as applicable, that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the annual base salary or wages
in effect for each such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and
(ii) employee benefits and other cash compensation (other than any equity or
equity-based, defined benefit pension, and nonqualified deferred compensation
benefits) that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to the employee
benefits and other cash compensation (other than any equity or equity-based,
defined benefit pension, and nonqualified deferred compensation benefits)
provided by or on behalf of the Company to the Company Employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , that, except as provided in _Section
5.10(c)_, nothing contained in this _Section 5.10_ shall be construed as
requiring Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to continue or adopt any specific plans or to continue the
employment of any specific Person.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, starting on
the Closing Date, Parent and Surviving Corporation shall, for a period ending
on the date one (1) year after the Closing Date, maintain a severance pay
practice for the benefit of each Company Employee that is substantially
similar in the aggregate to the severance pay practice in effect and
applicable to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) With respect to any annual incentive bonuses that may be payable to
Company Employees under the Companys annual bonus plan in respect of the year
in which the Closing Date occurs, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall adopt
and maintain such bonus plan and pay such bonuses in the ordinary course,
subject to the performance and service requirements and other terms and
conditions of the annual incentive plan as established by the Company prior to
the Closing.

 



 

(d) Parent shall recognize the service of Company Employees with the Company
or its Subsidiaries (or their respective Affiliates) prior to the Closing Date
as service with Parent or its Affiliates in connection with any employee
benefit plans, programs, Contracts and arrangements (including 401(k) plans,
vacation, sick leave and holiday policies) maintained by Parent and its
Affiliates which is made available following the Closing Date by Parent and
its Affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting and eligibility
(but, for the avoidance of

 



      
 

 



 

doubt, excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit plan) to the
extent such service was credited for the same purpose under the corresponding
Company Plan prior to Closing; provided, however, that no such service shall
be credited to the extent that doing so would result in the duplication of
benefits.

 



 

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all
limitations as to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees under
any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is made
available to Company Employees following the Closing Date by Parent or one of
its Affiliates to the extent such limitations or conditions would have been
satisfied or waived under the terms of the comparable Company Plan prior to
Closing, and (ii) provide credit to Company Employees for any co-payments,
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such employees under the
corresponding Company Plan during the portion of the relevant plan year
including the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express
or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
employee benefit plan or arrangement, or shall limit the right of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to amend, terminate or
otherwise modify any Company Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan or
arrangement sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates following the Closing Date. In the event that (i) a Person not a
party to this Agreement makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any
provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any employee benefit plan or
arrangement sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an amendment to such plan
or arrangement even though not explicitly designated as such in this
Agreement, then such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no
amendatory effect. The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this _Section 5.10_ with respect to the Company Employees are
included for the sole benefit of the parties, and that nothing in this
Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third party
beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other Person, including any employees,
former employees, any participant in any employee benefit plan, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, as the case may be, of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event of which is likely to cause any representation or
warranty of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to be untrue or
inaccurate at the Closing Date such that the applicable conditions to closing
set forth in _Article VI_ would fail to be satisfied, and (ii) any failure by
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to materially comply with or
materially satisfy any covenant or other agreement to be complied with by it
hereunder such that the applicable conditions to closing set forth in _Article
VI_ would fail to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.11(a)_ shall not (x) limit or
otherwise affect any remedies available to Parent or the Company or (y) cure
any breach of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or
conditions contained in this Agreement, as the case may be.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any notice or other
communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging any material breach
of, or material default under, any Company Material Contract. In addition, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of any notice or other material communication received
by such party from any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time, regarding any consent that is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of notice by the Company to Parent,
or Parent to the Company, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 5.11(b)_
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent
or the Company, respectively.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly (and in any
event, within two (2) Business Days) advise Parent of any Action commenced or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, has been threatened to be commenced after the

Stockholder (whether on its or their own behalf or on behalf of the Company)
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (any such Action, " _Stockholder
Litigation_ "), and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such
litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to review and
comment on all filings and responses to be made by the Company in connection
with (which such comments the Company will in good faith take into account),
and to participate and consult with the Company regarding the defense or
settlement of, any Stockholder Litigation and shall consider Parents views
with respect to any Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall not settle,
compromise or enter into any arrangement, or consent to the entry of, or fail
to defend against entry of, any order or judgment, with respect to any
Stockholder Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent; _provided_
, that the prior written consent of Parent shall not be required for any such
settlement, compromise, arrangement, order or judgment that does not (x)
require any monetary payment to be made directly or indirectly by the Company,
other than the payment of _de minimis_ amounts (for the avoidance of doubt,
any payments by the Companys Director and Officer liability insurance
carriers shall not be considered a monetary payment to be made directly or
indirectly by the Company), (y) include an admission of liability or
wrongdoing on the part of the Company or any of its directors or (z) directly
or indirectly impose any other obligations on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries other than customary administerial requirements. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a
limitation on the right of the Company to honor obligations of indemnification
to the Companys directors in accordance with the terms thereof. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall not enter into any settlement agreement, or
permit entry of any order or judgment, in respect of any Stockholder
Litigation without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Equity Awards or other derivative securities) resulting from the transactions
contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to, take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange, consummate and obtain the Financing on the
conditions (including to the full exercise of any "flex" terms) no less
favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the conditions described in the
Financing Commitment Letters, including, but not limited to, using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitment Letters, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions that are in the control of Parent and
its Subsidiaries in the Financing Commitment Letters (taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) or obtain a waiver of such
conditions, (but in each case excluding any conditions where the failure to be
so satisfied is a result of the Companys failure to furnish information
required under this Agreement or the Companys material breach of any of its
other obligations under this Agreement) and comply in all material respects
with its obligations thereunder and (iii) diligently and in good faith enforce
its rights under the Financing Commitment Letters.

 



 

(b) In the event that all conditions to the Financing have been satisfied, the
Marketing Period has expired and all of the conditions to Closing hereunder
have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Financing to be funded on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Parent shall not have the right to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or consent to or waive any provision or any of its rights under, the
Financing Commitment Letters if such amendment, replacement, supplement,
modification, consent or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing from that contemplated in the Financing Commitment Letters to an
amount less than the Required Amount, (ii) impose new or additional conditions
or otherwise expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters or modify the terms of the Financing
(other than as permitted herein), in each case in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or materially impede or materially delay
the timely funding of the Required Amount on the Closing Date or (y)
materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Commitment Letters when required
pursuant to this Agreement (the new or additional conditions precedent
described in this clause (ii) referred to as " _Prohibited Conditions_ ").
Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company a true and complete copy of any
such amendment or modification. References to "Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters as permitted to be
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section 5.14_ or any
replacement or alternative financing, references to "Debt Financing" shall
include the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as
permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section
5.14_ or any replacement or alternative debt financing and references to "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this _Section 5.14_ or any replacement debt
commitment letter. In no event shall the Parent or Merger Sub have any
liability for breach of its covenants or agreements in this _Section 5.14_ if
the Closing occurs.

 



 

(d) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice (but in any event not
later than forty-eight (48) hours after the occurrence or discovery thereof)
(i) of any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Financing Commitment Letters of which Parent

 



      
 

 



 

becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt by Parent of any notice or other
communication from any Financing Source with respect to any actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by such party to the
Financing Commitment Letters, of any provisions thereto and (iii) of the
occurrence of any event or development that Parent expects to have a material
and adverse impact on the ability of Parent to obtain the timely funding of
the Required Amount on the Closing Date. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in any event within three (3) Business Days of the date the Company
delivers Parent a written request, Parent shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(e) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or Parent becomes
aware of any event or circumstance that makes any portion of the Debt
Financing unavailable, in each case, on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Debt Commitment Letter Parent shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange and obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event alternative financing (the " _Alternative Financing_
") from alternative financing sources (1) in an amount at least equal to the
amount of the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof (in each
case, after giving effect to any increase, if any, in the amount of the equity
financing to be provided pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter) and (2)
which such Alternative Financing shall not be subject to any conditions
precedent that would constitute Prohibited Conditions, provided that Parent
shall not be required to (x) seek equity financing from any source other than
those counterparty to the Equity Commitment Letter, (y) pay any fees in excess
of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
hereof or (z) agree to conditionality or economic terms that are less
favorable in the aggregate (including any market flex provisions set forth in
the fee letter) than those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date hereof and (ii) promptly thereafter, deliver to the Company
a true and complete fully executed new financing commitment letter (together
with the related fee letter, subject to redaction consistent with _Section
4.8(a)_) with respect to such Alternative Financing.

 



 

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that it is not a condition to the Closing
or to any of its other obligations under this Agreement that Parent obtain
financing (including the Financing or any Alternative Financing) for, or
related to, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

efforts to provide, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to use their respective reasonable best efforts to provide, to

survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Payments; Remedies_.

 



 

(a) _Company Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) In the event that the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(i)_, then the Company shall pay Parent substantially
concurrently with such termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i)_ a one-time
fee equal to Thirty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($31,500,000)
(the " _Company Termination Fee_ ").

 



 

(ii) In the event that (A) prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, in either case, at which a final vote
with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval was taken, Parent terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)(A)_, or (B) Parent terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)(B)_ then the Company shall pay
Parent within two (2) Business Days of the date of such termination a one-time
fee equal to the Company Termination Fee.

 



 

(iii) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(i)_, _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(i)(B)_, (B) at any time
prior to the termination of this Agreement (or, in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, in either case, at which
a final vote with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval was taken), an
Alternative Transaction Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise
made known to the Company Stockholders, senior management or the Board of
Directors of the Company, and (C) within twelve (12) months after the date of
such termination, the Company enters into any definitive agreement in respect
of an Alternative Transaction Proposal for which the transaction contemplated
thereby is subsequently consummated (regardless if consummated after such
twelve (12) month period), or the Company otherwise consummates any other such
transaction, then the Company shall pay Parent, within two (2) Business Days
of the date such transaction is consummated, a one-time fee equal to the
Company Termination Fee (provided that for purposes of this clause (ii), each
reference to "20%" in the definition of Alternative Transaction Proposal shall
be deemed to be references to "50%").

 



 

(iv) The Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses, if any and as applicable,
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the
applicable date specified above to an account designated by Parent. Parent
shall have the right to assign the right to receive the Company Termination
Fee or Parent Expenses to one or more Affiliates of Parent in its sole
discretion; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any such assignment
shall not in any manner whatsoever affect the parties agreements set forth in
this _Section 7.3_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Parent Termination Fee_. In the event that the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_, then
Parent shall pay the Company a one-time fee equal to Sixty-Three Million
Dollars ($63,000,000) (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company no later
than three (3) Business Days after any such termination; _provided_ that on
and following the date that is ninety (90) days after a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this _Article VII_ (the " _Cutoff Date_ "), neither the
Company nor any other Person shall have any right to seek or obtain the Parent
Termination Fee unless prior to the Cutoff Date the Company shall have
provided written notice to Parent that the Parent Termination Fee is due and
owing.

 



 

(c) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party
shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)(A)_ following
the Company Stockholders Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof,
in either case, at which a final vote with respect to the Company Stockholder
Approval was taken, then the Company shall, following receipt of an invoice
therefor, no later than three (3) Business Days after the date of such
termination, pay, or cause to be paid, at the direction of Parent, up to five
million Dollars ($5,000,000) of Parents reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Financing) (the " _Parent Expenses_ ").

 



 

(d) The Company and Parent each acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails
promptly to pay to the other party any amounts due pursuant to this _Section
7.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, such other party commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the failing party for the amounts set forth
in this _Section 7.3_, the non-prevailing party shall pay to the prevailing
party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts
due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ from the date such payment was required to
be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in
The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that any amount payable by the
Company or Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, including the Company
Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee, does not constitute a penalty,
but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate a party for the disposition of its rights under this Agreement
in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which amounts
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 



 

(e) Subject to Parents right to seek specific performance set forth in
_Section 8.12_ and right to seek damages pursuant to _Section 7.2_, (1)
Parents right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 7.3(a)_ and the Parent Expenses pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_ shall
be Parent and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holder, controlling Person, general or limited partner, stockholder, member,
manager, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate, assignee,

 



      
 

 



 

representative or financing source of the Company or its Subsidiaries (any
such Person, other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, a " _Company
Recourse Related Party_ ") for any damages suffered as a result of or arising
out of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
(2) upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, pursuant to the terms hereof,
none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Parent Recourse Related Parties shall have
any rights or claims against the Company or its Subsidiaries under this
Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
the Company shall have no further liability to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (and in no event will Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have any rights
or claims against any Company Recourse Related Party, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, arising out of this Agreement).

 



 

(f) Subject to the Companys right to seek specific performance set forth in
_Section 8.12_, (1) the Companys right to receive payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ and the terms of the Guaranty
shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantors, the Financing Sources, any of their respective Subsidiaries, or
Representatives, or any of their former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling Persons, general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, assignees, representatives or financing sources (any such Person,
other than Parent and Merger Sub, a " _Parent Recourse Related Party_ ") for
any damages suffered as a result of or arising out of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing) to be
consummated, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
(2) upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, pursuant to the terms hereof,
neither the Company nor any of the Company Recourse Related Parties shall have
any rights or claims against Parent, Merger Sub, the Financing Sources or the
Parent Recourse Related Parties under this Agreement, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and Parent, Merger Sub, the
Guarantors and the Financing Sources shall have no further liability to the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of the Company Recourse Related Parties with
respect to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guaranty or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Financing) (and in no event
will the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Recourse Related
Party have any rights or claims against any Parent Recourse Related Party,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, arising out of
this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guaranty). For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be subject to monetary damages in
excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee in the aggregate.

 



 

(g) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes of
action that may be based upon or under, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may
only be made (i) against the entities that are expressly identified as parties
hereto and pursuant to, and (ii) in accordance with (x) the terms of the
Guaranty, the Equity Commitment Letters or the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Guarantors or the other parties thereto, and (y) the terms of the Voting
Agreement, the stockholder party thereto. No other Parent Recourse Related
Party or Company Recourse Related Party shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim
against the parties to this Agreement (whether in tort, contract or otherwise)
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in respect of any oral representations made
or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without

 



       
 

 



 

limiting the rights of any party against the other parties hereto, in no event
shall any party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover monetary damages for breach of this Agreement from, any Parent
Recourse Related Party or Company Recourse Related Party.

Section 8.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of copies of this
Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile or e-mail shall constitute

 



      
 

 



 

effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may
be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the
parties transmitted by facsimile or e-mail shall be deemed to be their
original signatures for all purposes.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) (a)
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral (except for the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Guaranty), among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and neither party is relying on any other oral or written
representation, agreement or understanding and no party makes any express or
implied representation or warranty in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than as set forth in this Agreement, and
(b) except for the provisions of _Section 2.6_ (which after the Effective
Time are intended to benefit the Company Stockholders), _Section 5.7_ (which
upon the Effective Time are intended to benefit the Indemnified Persons),
_Section 5.15(e)_ (which is intended to benefit the officers and directors of
the Company and its Affiliates and their respective heirs, executors, estates
and personal representatives), _Section 7.3(d)_ (which is intended to benefit
the Company Recourse Related Parties), _Section 7.3(e)_ (which is intended to
benefit the Parent Recourse Related Parties and, to the extent contemplated
thereby, each of the Financing Sources), _Section 7.3(f)_ (which is intended
to benefit the Parent Recourse Related Parties and Company Recourse Related
Parties and each of the Financing Sources, to the extent contemplated thereby)
and each of _Section 7.3(g)_, _Section 8.4_, _Section 8.5_, _Section 8.6_,
_Section 8.7_, _Section 8.8_, _Section 8.12_, _Section 8.13_ or _Section
8.14_ (which are intended to benefit each of the Financing Sources, to the
extent contemplated thereby) is not intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties any rights or remedies.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Governing Law_. All disputes, claims or controversies arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance
of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to its rules of conflict of laws. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that any claim or
cause of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise), against any
Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or
the definitive agreements executed in connection therewith or the performance
thereof, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Amendments and Supplements_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time solely by additional written agreements
signed by, or on behalf of the parties, as may mutually be determined by the
parties to be necessary, desirable or expedient to further the purpose of this
Agreement or to clarify the intention of the parties, whether before or after
adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders or adoption of this
Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or adoption of this
Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, no amendment may be made to
this Agreement that pursuant to applicable law would require further approval
or adoption by the stockholders of the Company or the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub without such further approval or adoption; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that none of _Section 7.3(f)_, _Section 7.3(g)_, _Section 8.4_, _Section
8.5_, this _Section 8.6_, _Section 8.7_, _Section 8.8_, _Section 8.12_,

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 8.13_ or _Section 8.14_ (and any provision of this Agreement to
the extent an amendment, supplement or modification of such provision would
modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may be amended,
supplemented or changed in a manner that is adverse to any Financing Source,
without the prior written consent of such Financing Source. This Agreement may
not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of
conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically
designated as an amendment hereto, signed by, or on behalf of, each of the
parties in interest at the time of such amendment.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a
written instrument signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
provided herein shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no waiver of _Section
7.3(f)_, _Section 7.3(g)_, _Section 8.4_, _Section 8.5_, _Section 8.6_,
this _Section 8.7_, _Section 8.8_, _Section 8.12_, _Section 8.13_ or
_Section 8.14_ (or any other provision of this Agreement to the extent such
wavier would waive or modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions)
that is adverse to the interests of any Financing Source will be effective
against such Financing Source without the prior written consent of such
Financing Source adversely affected thereby.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under
this Agreement, in whole or in part from time to time, to (a) one or more of
its Affiliates, (b) to any parties providing secured debt financing for
purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning this
Agreement as collateral in respect of such secured debt financing, and (c)
after the Effective Time, to any Person; provided that any such assignment by
Parent or Merger Sub shall not, nor shall it purport to, relieve Parent,
Merger Sub or the Guarantors of any of their respective liabilities or
obligations hereunder. Any assignment in violation of the preceding two
sentences shall be void. Subject to the preceding three sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Headings_. The headings and table of contents contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by
the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest

 



      
 

 



 

extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent
possible.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Failure or Delay Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or
delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. It is explicitly agreed that
the Company shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parents and Merger
Subs obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the Equity Financing to
be funded (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the
Guarantors under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity
Financing to be timely completed in accordance with and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter) only in the event
that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (a) the conditions
set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (provided that each
such condition is then capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived at the time Closing would otherwise be required to occur
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be
funded, and the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ remain satisfied; (b)
the Debt Financing is available to be funded at the Closing and has been
funded in accordance with its terms or will be funded in accordance with its
terms at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded; and (c) the Company
has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then the
Company will take such actions as are within its control to effect the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled
to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents right to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing has not
been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing). In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the
remedy of specific performance of this Agreement other than solely under the
specific circumstances and as specifically set forth in this _Section 8.12_.

 



 

Section 8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT AND MERGER
SUB HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER AND THE DEBT FINANCING),
INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY
FINANCING SOURCE, OR THE ACTIONS OF THE COMPANY, PARENT, MERGER SUB OR ANY

 



      
 

 



 

FINANCING SOURCE IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 8.14 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby\\\
(a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit itself to the sole and
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware (or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over
such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States
located in the State of Delaware) (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ ") in
connection with any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in any of the Delaware
Courts, (c) agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum and
agrees not otherwise to attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
or venue by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d)
agrees that it will not bring any action, suit, or proceeding in connection
with any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in any court or other
tribunal, other than any of the Delaware Courts. All actions and proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, shall be heard and determined in the Delaware
Courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that service of process in connection with any dispute, claim, or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may be made upon such party by prepaid certified or
registered mail, with a validated proof of mailing receipt constituting
evidence of valid service, directed to such party at the address specified in
_Section 8.2_ hereof. Service made in such manner, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, shall have the same legal force and effect as if
served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit or prohibit service of process by any other manner as
may be permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or
support any claim or cause of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise),
against any Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt
Financing or the definitive agreements executed in connection therewith or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), and each
party waives any objection which such party may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such action, suit or proceeding, and irrevocably
submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any such action, suit or
proceeding.

 



 

Section 8.15 _Incorporation of Exhibits_. The Company Disclosure Letter, the
Parent Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits and schedules attached hereto and
referred to herein are hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof for
all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

 



 

Section 8.16 _No Joint Venture_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed as creating a joint venture or partnership between any of
the parties hereto. No party is by virtue of this Agreement authorized as an
agent, employee or legal representative of any other party. No party shall
have the power to control the activities and operations of any other and their

 



      
 

 



 

status is, and at all times shall continue to be, that of independent
contractors with respect to each other. No party shall have any power or
authority to bind or commit any other party. No party shall hold itself out as
having any authority or relationship in contravention of this _Section 8.16_.
