AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF SHARE EXCHANGE (this "Agreement") dated as of February
28, 2010, among MERCK KGaA, a German corporation with general partners
("Parent"), Concord Investments Corp., a Massachusetts corporation and a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and MILLIPORE CORPORATION, a
Massachusetts corporation (the "Company").

 

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub has adopted
and declared advisable, and in the best interests of the Company and Sub, as

in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the Massachusetts Business
Corporation Act (the "MBCA"), as a result of which exchange (the "Share
Exchange") the Company will become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Sub; and

 

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Share Exchange
and also to prescribe various conditions to the Share Exchange.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,

to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION 1.03. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file articles
of share exchange (the "Articles of Share Exchange") with the Secretary of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in such form as is required by, and
executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
MBCA. The Share Exchange shall become effective upon the filing of the
Articles of Share Exchange with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts or at such subsequent date and time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and specify in the Articles of Share Exchange. The date and time
at which the Share Exchange becomes effective is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Effective Time".

 

 

SECTION 1.04. Effects of the Share Exchange. The Share Exchange shall have
the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the MBCA.

 

 

SECTION 1.05. Articles of Organization and Bylaws. (a) The Restated Articles
of Organization of the Company (the "Company Articles of Organization") as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be the
articles of organization of the Acquired Corporation from and after the
Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 

 

(b) The Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Company Bylaws")
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be
the Bylaws of the Acquired Corporation from and after the Effective Time
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 

 

SECTION 1.06. Directors. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
cause all of the directors of the Company as of immediately prior to the

ARTICLE II

 

 

Effect of the Share Exchange on the Capital Stock of the

 

Exchanging Corporations; Exchange Fund;

 

Company Equity Awards

 

 

SECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Share Exchange and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent
or Sub:

 

 

(a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by
the Share Exchange and shall remain the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock of Sub following the Effective Time.

 

 

(b) Exchange of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Appraisal Shares) shall be exchanged for the right to receive $107.00 in
cash, without interest (the "Share Exchange Consideration"). At the
Effective Time, Sub shall acquire and become the sole holder and owner of
each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock so exchanged, and
each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Share Exchange
Consideration.

 

 

(c) Appraisal Rights. In the event the Share Exchange entitles holders
of Company Common Stock to appraisal rights under Part 13 of the MBCA
and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder who did not vote in favor
of the Share Exchange (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares (the "Appraisal
Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions
of Part 13 of the MBCA (the "Dissenting Shareholders"), shall not be
exchanged or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Share Exchange
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(b), but instead such holder shall
be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with
the provisions of Part 13 of the MBCA (and at the Effective Time, such
holders shall cease to have any rights with respect to any shares of Company
Common Stock held by such holders, except the right to receive the fair value
of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Part 13 of the
MBCA), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the MBCA. If any Dissenting
Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost such
right, such holder's shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon
be treated as if they had been exchanged for the right to receive, as of
the Effective Time, the Share Exchange Consideration for each such share of
Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 2.01, without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notices of
intent to seek appraisal and written demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the MBCA and received by the Company relating to
shareholders' rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the MBCA.

SECTION 2.02. Exchange Fund. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the
Share Exchange Consideration, the Equity Award Amounts and the Director Stock
Equivalent Amounts in accordance with this Article II and, in connection
therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in the form
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agency Agreement"). On the
Closing Date and prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the sum of (A) the aggregate
Share Exchange Consideration, (B) the Equity Award Amounts and (C) the
Director Stock Equivalent Amounts, in each case as required to be paid
pursuant to this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Fund").

 

 

(b) Certificate Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in any event within two business days thereafter, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which
shall otherwise be in customary form (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form)) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Share Exchange Consideration. Each
holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent
of such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.01(b), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of
the Share Exchange Consideration may be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any fiduciary or
surety bonds or any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Share Exchange Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Share Exchange Consideration which
the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate
pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II.

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificates. At the close of business on the day on which
the Effective Time occurs, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Acquired Corporation of the
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any registration in respect of the Share Exchange
or any subsequent transfer of Company Common Stock by Parent or its
affiliates). If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to
the Acquired Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery
of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article II.

 

 

(d) Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for nine months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain
liable for, payment of their claims for the Share Exchange Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

 

 

(e) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Acquired Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any
applicable state, Federal or other abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to
the date on which the related Share Exchange Consideration would escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Share
Exchange Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent.
Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment
of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates
to receive the Share Exchange Consideration, any holder of a Company Equity
Award to receive the holder's Equity Award Amount or any holder of a Director
Stock Equivalent to receive the holder's Director Stock Equivalent Amount, in
each case as provided herein.

(g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond or surety in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Share Exchange Consideration with respect thereto.

 

 

(h) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Acquired Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock, any holder of a Company Equity Award or any holder of a
Director Stock Equivalent such amounts as Parent, the Acquired Corporation or
the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, the Acquired Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, the
holder of the Company Equity Award or the holder of the Director Stock
Equivalent, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Acquired Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 

 

SECTION 2.03. Company Equity Awards. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective
Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate,
any committee administering the Company Stock Plan or a Specified
Deferred Compensation Plan) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions (including, with respect to Company Stock Options, providing the
holder of each such Company Stock Option with advance notice of the
cancellation of such Company Stock Option and an opportunity to exercise such
Company Stock Option prior to the Effective Time, in each case to the extent
required by the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan), as may be
required to provide that:

 

 

(i) at the Effective Time, each unexercised Company Stock Option, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive
an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Share
Exchange Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (B)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option (such amount, the "Option Amount");

 

 

(ii) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Performance RSU
Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held
by any individual who has not entered into an Executive Termination Agreement
with the Company shall vest as to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable pursuant to such Company Performance RSU Award upon attainment
of the target level of performance applicable to such Company Performance RSU
Award (the "Non-Executive Vested Performance RSU Shares"), and, at the
Effective Time, the Non-Executive Vested Performance RSU Shares shall be
shares of Company Common Stock for purposes of Section 2.01(b), with the
holder of such Company Performance RSU Award becoming entitled to receive an
amount in cash equal to (A) the Share Exchange Consideration multiplied by
(B) the number of Non-Executive Vested Performance RSU Shares attributable to
such Company Performance RSU Award (such amount, the "Non-Executive
Performance RSU Amount"); and

Table of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Performance RSU
Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held
by any individual who has entered into an Executive Termination Agreement
with the Company shall vest as to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock specified as vesting upon a "Change of Control" in the applicable
agreement for such Company Performance RSU Award (the "Executive Vested
Performance RSU Shares"), and any remaining portion of such Company
Performance RSU Award shall be cancelled at such time and without
consideration therefor, and, at the Effective Time, the Executive Vested
Performance RSU Shares shall be shares of Company Common Stock for purposes
of Section 2.01(b), with the holder of such Company Performance RSU Award
becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the Share
Exchange Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of Executive Vested
Performance RSU Shares attributable to such Company Performance RSU Award
(such amount, the "Executive Performance RSU Amount");

 

 

(iv) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested,
and, at the Effective Time, the vested shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU Award shall be shares of Company Common Stock for
purposes of Section 2.01(b), with the holder of a Company RSU Award becoming
entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the Share Exchange
Consideration multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company RSU Award at the Effective Time (such amount, the
"RSU Amount").

 

 

The term "Equity Award Amounts" means the sum of the aggregate Option
Amounts, aggregate Non-Executive Performance RSU Amounts, aggregate Executive
Performance RSU Amounts and aggregate RSU Amounts, and the term "Equity Award
Amount" means the portion of the aggregate Option Amounts, Non-Executive
Performance RSU Amounts, Executive Performance RSU Amounts or RSU Amounts (as
applicable) payable to any holder of a Company Equity Award. Except as
otherwise required under the terms of the applicable award or as necessary to
avoid the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties on any Equity Award
Amount pursuant to Section 409A of the Code, all amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.03(a) shall be paid as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time, without interest.

(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and
after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Acquired Corporation will be
required to deliver Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the
Company to any person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards,
the Convertible Notes or otherwise. As of the Effective Time, each Company
Stock Equivalent issued under a Specified Deferred Compensation Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent
the right to the equivalent in value and rate of return to a share of Company
Common Stock and shall instead be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the Share Exchange Consideration (such amount, the
"Stock Equivalent Amount"). Stock Equivalent Amounts payable in respect
of Company Stock Equivalents outstanding under (i) the Director Deferral
Agreements (such stock equivalents, the "Director Stock Equivalents" and,

statements and other documents with the SEC required to be filed by

respective dates of filing, the SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as the
case may be, and in each case the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable thereto, and as of their respective dates (or if
amended by a subsequent filing with the SEC prior to the date hereof, as of
the date of such amendment) none of the SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited quarterly
financial statements (including, in each case, the notes thereto) of the
Company included in the SEC Documents when filed complied in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been prepared in all material respects in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case
of unaudited quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC or
other rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for
the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Except for matters
reflected or reserved against in the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of December 31, 2009 (or the notes thereto) included in the Filed
SEC Documents, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent, fixed or
otherwise) of any nature that would be required under GAAP, as in effect on

of the Company (including the notes thereto), except liabilities and
obligations that (i) were incurred since December 31, 2009 in the ordinary
course of business in accordance with past practice, (ii) are incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii)

basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company's
filings with the SEC. The Company maintains internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the
Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective

to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii)

permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance

unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that
could have a material effect on its financial statements. The Company

officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date of this Agreement,

internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to

report financial information and has identified for the Company's auditors

weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.

the Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, except that no representation or
warranty is made by the Company with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by Parent or
Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

exemptions, permits and consents of Governmental Entities (collectively,

(l) Labor and Employment Matters. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any material collective bargaining agreement or
any other material contract or agreement with any labor organization (other
than any such agreement with a works council or other employee organization
that applies on a regional, nationwide or industry-wide basis by virtue of
applicable Law or by virtue of the membership of the Company in any employer
federation or comparable organization) (collectively, the "Company
Labor Agreements"), nor is any such contract or agreement, as of the
date hereof, being negotiated. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are not any pending or threatened union
organizing activities concerning any employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no labor strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, material
grievances or material arbitrations pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(m) Employee Benefit Matters. (i) Section 3.01(m)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list, as of the date

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) (a
"Company Pension Plan"), (B) each material Company Benefit Plan that is an

each material Company Benefit Plan maintained primarily for the benefit
of individuals regularly employed outside the United States ("Company Foreign

all material Company Benefit Agreements. Each Company Benefit Plan, Company
Foreign Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement has been administered in
compliance with its terms and with applicable Law (including ERISA and
the Code), other than instances of noncompliance that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

(ii) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of (to
the extent applicable) (A) each material Company Benefit Plan and each
material Company Benefit Agreement or, at the Company's option in the case of
a material Company Foreign Benefit Plan, a summary thereof (or, in either
case, with respect to any unwritten material Company Benefit Plan or material
Company Benefit Agreement, a written description thereof), other than any
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is prohibited from making available to Parent as the result
of applicable Law relating to the safeguarding of data privacy, (B) the most
recent annual report on Form 5500 filed with the Internal Revenue Service or

(iii) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" or registered
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision
under applicable non-U.S. laws) has received a favorable determination letter
as to such qualification or registration from the Internal Revenue Service
(or any comparable Governmental Entity), and no event has occurred, either by
reason of any action or failure to act, that would reasonably be expected to
cause the loss of any such qualification, registration or tax-exempt status,
except where such loss of qualification, registration or tax-exempt status,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(iv) Except as individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any officer of the Company or any such Subsidiary or any
Company Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA, including any Company Pension
Plan, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trust created thereunder or
any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that would
reasonably be expected to subject the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
officer of the Company or any such Subsidiary to the tax or penalty on
prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 of the Code or to any
liability under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA.

Subsidiaries after retirement or other termination of service (other than
coverage or benefits (A) required to be provided under Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA or any other applicable Law or (B) the full cost of which is borne by
the employee or former employee (or any of their beneficiaries)).

 

 

(vi) During the immediately preceding six years, no liability under Title IV
or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated, that together with the Company would
be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA
("ERISA Affiliate") that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition
exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of
incurring any such liability, other than liability for premiums due the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") (which premiums have been paid
when due). No Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA ("Title IV
Plan") or any trust established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency" (as defined in section 302 of ERISA and section 412 of
the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recent
fiscal year of each Title IV Plan ended prior to the date hereof. The PBGC
has not instituted proceedings pursuant to Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate
any of the Title IV Plans and no condition exists that presents a material
risk that such proceedings will be instituted by the PBGC.

(viii) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, neither the execution
of this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will, either alone or in
combination with another event, (A) entitle any current or former employee,
officer or director of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any material
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other material payment or (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount,
of compensation due any such employee, officer or director. Neither the

caused to be filed all material tax returns required to be filed by it (or
requests for extensions, which requests have been granted and have not
expired), and all such returns are complete and accurate in all material
respects. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has either paid or caused
to be paid all material taxes due and owing by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity, or the most recent financial
statements contained in the Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve
(excluding any reserves for deferred taxes), if such a reserve is required by
GAAP, for all material taxes payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries, for
all taxable periods and portions thereof ending on or before the date of such
financial statements.

 

 

(ii) No deficiencies, audit examinations, refund litigation, proposed
adjustments or matters in controversy for any material taxes (other than
taxes that are not yet due and payable or for amounts being contested in good
faith and for which adequate reserves have been established in the financial
statements contained in the Filed SEC Documents) have been proposed, asserted
or assessed in writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
have not been settled and paid. All assessments for material taxes due and
owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to completed and
settled examinations or concluded litigation have been paid. There is no
currently effective agreement or other document with respect to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries extending the period of assessment or collection
of any material taxes. There are no Liens for material taxes upon the assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than Permitted Liens.

for material taxes of any Person (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor by
contract or otherwise, (2) is a party to or bound by any material tax sharing
agreement or tax indemnity agreement, arrangement or practice (other than
such an agreement, arrangement or practice exclusively among the Company and
its Subsidiaries) or (3) has participated in any "tax amnesty" or similar
program offered by any taxing authority to avoid the assessment of penalties
or other additions to tax.

 

 

(iv) Within the last five years, no written claim has been made by any
authority in a jurisdiction where any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not file a tax return that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is, or may be, subject to a material amount of tax by that
jurisdiction.

 

 

(v) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include in income after the Effective Time a material amount of taxable

Time as a result of any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law
or by agreement with any taxing authority.

(vi) No "ownership change" (as described in Section 382(g) of the Code) has

have the effect of limiting the use of "pre-change losses", "excess credit",
foreign tax credit carryovers or net capital losses, in each case, of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, following the Effective Time.

 

 

(vii) The Convertible Notes were not treated as "corporate acquisition
indebtedness" described in Section 279(b) of the Code at the time they were
issued. To the Company's Knowledge, the comparable yield of 6.94% on the

be made for any differences between payments that were projected to have been
made and payments that were actually made or shall be made by the Company.

the right to use that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no claims are pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor are there any outstanding

in the past, in any material respect any material rights relating to
Intellectual Property of any person, except for any such violation,
infringement or misappropriation that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Company, no other person has violated, infringed upon or
misappropriated any Intellectual Property rights of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for any such violation, infringement or misappropriation
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to

SECTION 3.02. Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub. Parent and

recognized under applicable Law) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on
its business as presently conducted.

 

 

(b) Authority; Noncontravention. Each of Parent and Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement

and no other corporate proceedings (including any shareholder action) on the
part of Parent or Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Sub, enforceable against Parent and Sub in
accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy,
insolvency and other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Transactions,
and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with,
or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) under, create or affect any rights under, or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, any requirement to provide
notice to, or require consent or approval from, the other party thereto, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
Parent or Sub under, any provision of (A) the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of Parent or the articles of organization or bylaws of Sub or (B)
subject to the filings and other matters involving Governmental Entities
referred to in the immediately following sentence, (i) any Contract to which
Parent or Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which

for Parent, Sub and their Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii) any Law or
Judgment or related settlement, in each case applicable to Parent or Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, and that is material for Parent, Sub and their Subsidiaries taken as
a whole. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, registration,
declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required
to be obtained or made by or with respect to Parent or Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent and Sub or the consummation by Parent and Sub of the
Transactions, except for (I) the filing of a premerger notification and
report form by Parent and Sub under the HSR Act and the filings and receipt,
termination or expiration, as applicable, of such other approvals or waiting
periods as may be required under any Merger Control Law, (II) the filing of
the Articles of Share Exchange with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and (III) such other consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations, filings and notices, the
failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

together, will at the Effective Time be sufficient to effect

Aktiengesellschaft, Filiale Luxemburg, BNP Paribas, Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft, Merrill Lynch International and the other financial
institutions party thereto (the "Credit Agreement" and, the financing
contemplated thereby, the "Financing"), which Credit Agreement is in full
force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and
the other parties thereto. No event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any term or condition of the
Credit Agreement, and Parent has no reason to believe that any portion of the
Financing to be made thereunder will not be available to Parent or Sub on a
timely basis to consummate the Transactions.

purpose of engaging in the Transactions and, prior to the Effective Time,

Subsidiaries beneficially owns (within the meaning of Section 13 of the

Stock, or is a party, or will prior to the Closing Date become a party, to
any Contract, arrangement or understanding (other than this Agreement) for
the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of
Company Common Stock.

Knowledge of Parent or Sub, threatened against Parent or Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. There is no
Judgment outstanding against Parent or Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(h) Brokers and Other Advisors. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other person, other than Guggenheim Partners, LLC and Perella
Weinberg Partners LP, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent,
is entitled to any broker's, finder's or financial advisor's fee or
commission in connection with the Share Exchange and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent or Sub.

involving the Company or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity or (b) 50% or more (based on the fair market

for the capital stock of, or any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving, any Subsidiary of the Company), taken as a whole,
which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) would be more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the Share Exchange, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory
and other aspects of such proposal and of this Agreement (including the
relative risks of non-consummation and any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company, prior to the expiration of the
Notice Period referred to below in response to such proposal or otherwise).

attempt, and the identity of the person making, seeking or contemplating such
Takeover Proposal or such expression of interest or any such request or
attempt. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a current

exchange agreement, acquisition agreement, agreement which requires the

Board of Directors of the Company may: (x) if and to the extent the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, make an Adverse Recommendation Change and (y) in response to a
Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 4.02,
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement and, concurrently with or after
such termination, cause the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement;
provided, however, that (1) no Adverse Recommendation Change may be made, (2)
no termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.02(e) may be made
and (3) no Acquisition Agreement may be executed or entered into by the
Company, until after the fifth business day (or such subsequent business days
as provided for by clause (ii) of this sentence) (the period inclusive of all
such days, the "Notice Period") following Parent's receipt of written notice
from the Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company
intends to (x) in the case of clause (1) above, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change (a "Notice of Adverse Recommendation") or (y) in the
case of clauses (2) and (3) above, terminate this Agreement and
simultaneously enter into an Acquisition Agreement pursuant to this Section
4.02(e) (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") and specifying the reasons
therefor, including, if the basis of the proposed action by the Board of
Directors is a Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any
such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that (i) during the
Notice Period the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) and (ii) any amendment to the terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation or
Notice of Superior Proposal and a two-business day extension of the Notice
Period then applicable). In determining whether to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or to cause the Company to so terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.02(e), the Board of Directors of the
Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent to the Company in response to a Notice of

date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders (the "Stockholders' Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the

reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement to all of
its and its Subsidiaries' properties, books and records and to those
employees of the Company to whom Parent reasonably requests access, and,
during such period, the Company shall furnish, as promptly as practicable, to
Parent all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request (including the

Representatives to conduct any environmental testing or sampling).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its

jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or any Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is subject. The parties shall make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements in circumstances where the previous
sentence applies. Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of
that certain confidentiality letter agreement dated as of February 3, 2010,
between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), Parent shall hold, and shall cause their
respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other Representatives to hold, all information received from the Company or
its Representatives, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 5.03. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following (provided, however, that this Section 5.03 shall not apply to any
actions related to the Financing as to which Section 5.09 shall apply
exclusively in determining Parent's obligations with respect thereto): (i)
the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and
filings (including filings under the HSR Act and other registrations,
declarations and filings with, or notices to, Governmental Entities,
including pursuant to Merger Control Laws) and the taking of all steps as may
be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid a claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation by, any Governmental Entity, (iii)
the obtaining of consents, approvals and waivers from third parties
reasonably requested by Parent to be obtained in connection with the
Transactions; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries be required to make any payment to such third parties or
concede anything of value in any case prior to the Effective Time in order to
obtain any such consent, approval or waiver, and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement. It is understood and agreed that "reasonable best efforts" of a
party with respect to actions or undertakings relating to any person other
than a Governmental Entity shall not include any actions or undertakings
which would reasonably be expected to result in material cost or material
harm to such party. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing,
the Company and its Board of Directors shall (A) take all action necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute is or becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Share Exchange or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (B) if any state takeover statute becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Share Exchange or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the
Share Exchange and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on this Agreement, the Share Exchange and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. No party shall voluntarily extend any waiting period under
the HSR Act or any Merger Control Law or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the Transactions except
with the prior written consent of the other parties (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and which reasonableness shall be determined
in light of each party's obligation to use reasonable best efforts to do all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions).

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by any Governmental Entity challenging any of the Transactions as
violative of the HSR Act or any Merger Control Law, Parent and the Company
shall cooperate and use all reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and
resist any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the consummation of the
Transactions, including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal unless, each of Parent and the Company
reasonably determine that litigation is not in their respective best
interests. The parties shall take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under the HSR Act or any Merger Control Law so as
to enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such
businesses, product lines or assets of the Company, Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parent's or its respective
Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of
the Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, in each case as may
be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any preliminary or permanent injunction which would otherwise have the effect
of preventing the consummation of the Transactions, and in that regard Parent
and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose
of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits
its freedom of action with respect to, or Parent's or their Subsidiaries'
ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however,
that any such action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Transaction; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement, including
Section 5.03, shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to agree to or take any
action that would result in any Burdensome Condition. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Burdensome Condition" shall mean making proposals, executing or
carrying out agreements (including consent decrees) or submitting to Laws (a)
providing for the license, sale or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories
of assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
the holding separate of the capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company or
(b) imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the ability of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to conduct their
respective businesses (including, with respect to, market practices and
structure) or to own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights
of ownership of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent or
its Subsidiaries, that, in the case of clause (a) and (b), individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on the business or results of operations of (i) the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this Section
5.03, Parent and the Company agree that (i) unless separate filings are
required by applicable Law, all filings to any Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition Laws
("Governmental Antitrust Authority") shall be made by Parent on behalf of all
parties involved, (ii) the parties shall reasonably cooperate in all respects
with each other in the preparation of any filing or notification and in
connection with any submission, investigation or inquiry of any Governmental
Antitrust Authority, (iii) each party will supply to any competent
Governmental Antitrust Authority as promptly as practicable non-privileged
information and documents (a) requested by any Governmental Antitrust
Authority or (b) that are necessary or advisable (as reasonably determined by
the parties) to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) the parties will promptly provide each other with copies of
any written communication (or written summaries of any non-written
communication) in connection with any proceeding with any competent
Governmental Antitrust Authority; (v) a party will initiate a substantive
discussion with any competent Governmental Antitrust Authority concerning the
merits of the antitrust or competition analysis only after consultation with
the other party; and (vi) the parties will promptly inform each other in
advance of the time and place of any substantive meetings or conferences
(including telephone calls) with any Governmental Antitrust Authority
concerning the merits of the antitrust or competition analysis and give each
other and their respective advisors, to the extent reasonably practicable,
the opportunity to participate in all such meetings or conferences.

SECTION 5.04. Benefit Plans. (a) From the Effective Time through December
31, 2011 (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Acquired Corporation (or in the case of a transfer of all or
substantially all the assets and business of the Acquired Corporation, its
successors and assigns) to provide, each individual who is employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time and
who is not covered by any Company Labor Agreement (each, a "Company
Employee") with (i) base compensation that is no less favorable than the base
compensation provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) bonus or incentive opportunities that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the bonus or incentive opportunities
(including the corresponding grant date fair value in respect of any annual
equity-based compensation award in 2010) provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the Continuation
Period, the Company Employees shall be entitled to participate in the plans
of Parent, the Acquired Corporation or their respective affiliates (the
"Acquired Corporation Plans") to the same extent as other similarly situated
employees of Parent, the Acquired Corporation and their respective
affiliates. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Company Employee and Union Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Acquired
Corporation Plans to the extent coverage under any such plan replaces
coverage under a comparable benefit plan in which such Company Employee or
Union Employee participates immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall prevent
Parent or the Acquired Corporation from amending or terminating any specific
plan, program, policy, practice or arrangement, or interfere with the
Acquired Corporation's obligation to make such changes as are necessary to
comply with applicable Law, or preclude the Acquired Corporation from
terminating the employment of any Company Employee for any reason. The terms
and conditions of employment for any employee who is covered by a Company
Labor Agreement (a "Union Employee") shall be governed by the applicable
Company Labor Agreement and applicable Law.

 

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.04(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Acquired Corporation to
assume, honor and continue during the Continuation Period or, if later, until
all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Company's
employment, severance, retention, termination and change in control plans,
policies, programs, agreements and arrangements (including any change in
control severance agreement or other Company Benefit Agreement between the
Company and any Company Employee) maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and all of the Company Labor Agreements, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments,
benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event), without
any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or modification
required to comply with applicable Law.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Sections 5.04(a) and 5.04(b), during
the Continuation Period the Company Employees shall be entitled to
participate in the incentive compensation plans maintained by Parent, the
Acquired Corporation and their respective affiliates (the "Acquired
Corporation Incentive Plans"), in each case to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Parent, the Acquired Corporation or their respective
affiliates; provided that in the case of any Company Employee whose
employment is terminated by Parent, the Acquired Corporation or their
respective affiliates without cause during any annual performance period
under the Acquired Corporation Incentive Plans that commences during the
Continuation Period, such Company Employee shall be entitled to a payment in
cash equal to such Company Employee's target annual bonus in effect under the
applicable Acquired Corporation Incentive Plan for the applicable annual
performance period, prorated to reflect the number of days during such annual
performance period that elapsed prior to such termination of employment.

 

 

(d) With respect to all Acquired Corporation Plans, including but not limited
to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
maintained by Parent or any of its respective Subsidiaries (including any
vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes, including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, and,
to the extent required by applicable Law or any Company Labor Agreement,
benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies, each Company Employee's and
Union Employee's service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well
as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized
by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent or
any of their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service
need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in
any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.04(a), Parent shall waive,
or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent or any of its affiliates in which Company Employees
or Union Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all
co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company
Employee and Union Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying
such year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time.

 

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.04(a), during the
Continuation Period, if Parent or the Acquired Corporation terminates the
employment of any Company Employee, Parent shall pay, or shall cause the
Acquired Corporation to pay, to such Company Employee severance in an amount
equal to the greatest of (i) the severance benefits due under the applicable
severance plan, policy or guidelines of Parent, the Acquired Corporation or
their respective affiliates then in effect for similarly situated employees
of Parent, the Acquired Corporation or their respective affiliates, (ii) the
severance benefits that would have been due under the applicable severance
plan, policy or guidelines of the Company or its Subsidiaries that was
applicable to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (iii) the severance benefits due under any individual agreement between
the Company and such Company Employee. Without limiting the generality of
Section 5.04(a) or Section 5.04(d), the level of severance benefits a
terminated Company Employee is entitled to receive pursuant to clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence shall be determined by taking into
account such employee's service with the Company and its Subsidiary (and any
predecessor to the extent the service with the predecessor is recognized by
the Company or Subsidiary) prior to the Effective Time and such employee's
service with Parent, the Acquired Corporation or their respective affiliates
on and after the Effective Time.

SECTION 5.05. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person who is or prior
to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an
"Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company Articles of Organization, the
Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company
or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the date
hereof or, with respect to any indemnification agreement entered into after
the date hereof, to the extent the terms thereof are no more favorable in any
material respect to the Indemnified Party that is the beneficiary thereof
than the terms of any indemnification agreement included as an exhibit in the
Filed SEC Documents) shall survive the Share Exchange and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 

 

(b) Without limiting Section 5.05(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time,
in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (a "Claim"), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in
a capacity as a member of any board committee), officer, employee or agent of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors
or (ii) this Agreement or any of the Transactions, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Acquired Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such
threatened or actual Claim. Parent hereby guarantees and shall be jointly and
severally liable for any obligation of Acquired Corporation under this
Section 5.05(b) as it were its own obligation. None of Parent or the Acquired
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification could be sought
by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the
Acquired Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense
of any matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification
hereunder. Parent's and the Acquired Corporation's obligations under this
Section 5.05(b) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

(c) The Company may obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years
from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however,
that, without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company may not expend
therefor in excess of 300% of the amount (the "Annual Amount") payable by
the Company for 12 months of coverage under its existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies. In the event the Company does not
obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then, for a period of six years from
the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
Indemnified Party on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policies in effect on the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of
a reputable and financially sound insurance company containing terms,
including with respect to coverage and amounts, no less favorable to any
Indemnified Party; provided further, however, that in satisfying their
obligation under this Section 5.05(c), Parent shall not be obligated to pay
for coverage for any 12-month period aggregate premiums for insurance in
excess of 250% of the Annual Amount, it being understood and agreed that
Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may
be obtained for the Annual Amount.

 

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Acquired Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any person, or if
Parent dissolves the Acquired Corporation, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable
successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.05.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise.

 

 

SECTION 5.06. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as provided in Section 5.06(b),
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Financing, shall be paid by the party incurring
such fees or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

 

 

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (ii) (A) after the date of this Agreement,
a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly made to the Company or shall
have been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall
have otherwise become publicly known, (B) thereafter, this Agreement
is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(e) or by Parent or
the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the Stockholders'
Meeting has not been held by the Outside Date) or Section 7.01(b)(iii)
and (C) within nine months after such termination, the Company enters into
a definitive agreement to consummate or consummates the transactions
contemplated by any Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay Parent the
Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds (1) in the case of
a payment required by clause (i) above, prior to or concurrently with
the date of termination of this Agreement and (2) in the case of a
payment required by clause (ii) above, prior to or concurrently with the
earlier of the date of entry into a definitive agreement or the date of
consummation referred to in clause (ii)(C). For purposes of this
Section 5.06(b), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned
to such term in Section 4.02(b), except that all references to 15% therein
shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

 

 

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in
Section 5.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to Section 5.06(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commence a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Company Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent their costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

 

 

SECTION 5.07. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements or filing
with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement or other disclosure prior to such
consultation and, with respect to any press release or public statement by
the Company with respect to the Financing, only after consent by Parent,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or the rules and
regulations of any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system and except to the extent permitted under Section 4.02. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
Transactions shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

SECTION 5.08. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

 

SECTION 5.09. Financing. (a) Parent and Sub shall use, and shall cause their
controlled Affiliates to use, their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable, and to execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such instruments and documents as may be required, to
arrange the Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and
subject only to the conditions contained in the Credit Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each of
Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree that its obligation to consummate the
Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein is
not conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the Financing, the
availability of any replacement financing or receipt of the proceeds
therefrom. Parent and Sub shall use, and cause their controlled Affiliates to
use, their reasonable best efforts (i) to enforce their rights under the
Credit Agreement and (ii) to avoid any event or circumstance that impedes or
delays Closing, including, in the event that all conditions to the Credit
Agreement have been satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied), to cause
the lenders thereunder to fund on the Closing Date the Financing required to
consummate the Transactions. If any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable or Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes
any portion of the Financing unavailable, in each case, on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, and such portion is
required to consummate the Transactions, Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable, use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative financing from alternative financial institutions in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Transactions. Parent shall give the Company
prompt written notice of any material breach by any party to the Credit
Agreement or any condition to the Financing becoming unable to be satisfied,
in each case, of which Parent becomes aware, or of any termination of the
Credit Agreement. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status of the Financing.

 

 

(b) The Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide and
shall request that its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives provide, such
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or any
alternative financing to finance in whole or in part the Transaction
(including the issue or registered offering of any debt securities) as may be
reasonably requested by Parent; provided that none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any fee or enter into any
definitive agreement or incur any other liability in connection with the
Financing prior to the Effective Time; and provided further that
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives in connection with such cooperation.
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith. The
Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries' logos in
connection with the Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of it Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks.

reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws
and rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to enable the delisting
by the Company of the Shares from the New York Stock Exchange and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

 

 

SECTION 5.11. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act any disposition of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) that
is treated as a disposition under such rule and results from the Transactions
by each director or officer of the Company who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company.

Parent and Sub set forth in the first three sentences of Section 3.02(b)
(Authority; Noncontravention) shall be true and correct in all material
respects. All other representations and warranties of Parent and Sub set
forth in Section 3.02 of this Agreement shall be true and correct
(disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality", "Parent
Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as though made on the
Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties
expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by an executive officer
thereof to such effects.

 

 

(b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Sub. Parent and Sub shall have,
in all material respects, performed or complied with all material obligations
required to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement by the
time of the Closing, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed
on behalf of Parent by an executive officer thereof to such effect.

 

 

SECTION 6.04. Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Parent nor Sub may
rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.01 or 6.02 to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by the failure of Parent and/or Sub to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, to act in good faith or
to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Transactions and the
Financing, as required by and subject to Sections 5.03 and 5.09. The Company
may not rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.01 or
6.03 to be satisfied if such failure was caused by its failure to perform any
of its obligations under this Agreement, to act in good faith or to use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Transactions, as required by and
subject to Section 5.03.

(i) if the Share Exchange shall not have been consummated on or before
October 31, 2010 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that if on the
Outside Date the condition to Closing set forth in Section 6.01(b) shall
not have been satisfied but all other conditions to Closing shall be
satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied, then the Outside Date shall
be extended to November 30, 2010 if the Company or Parent notifies the other
on or prior to October 31, 2010 of its election to extend the Outside Date to
November 30, 2010; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party
if the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement, the failure to act in good faith or the failure to use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Transactions, including to the
extent required by and subject to Sections 5.03 and 5.09, has been a
principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Share Exchange to be
consummated on or before such date (it being understood that Parent and Sub
shall be deemed a single party for purposes of the foregoing proviso);

 

 

(ii) if any Restraint having any of the effects set forth in Section 6.01(c)
shall have become final and nonappealable; provided that the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(ii) shall have
used its reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of and to remove such
Restraint; or

 

 

(iii) if the Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Stockholders' Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof;

 

 

(c) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached any of its representations
or warranties, or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b)
and (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or, if curable
by such date, is not cured within the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after
written notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company and (B) the Outside
Date; provided that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(c) if either Parent or Sub is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder;

 

 

(d) by the Company, if Parent or Sub shall have breached any of its
representations or warranties, or failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
6.03(a) or 6.03(b) and (ii) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside
Date or, if curable by such date, is not cured within the earlier of (A)
thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by the Company to
Parent and (B) the Outside Date; provided that the Company shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(d) if the
Company is then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder;

(e) by Parent, in the event that (i) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall
have occurred or (ii) the Company's Board of Directors shall have failed to
reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement and the Share Exchange within
ten (10) business days after receipt of any written request to do so from
Parent (which request may only be made following public disclosure of a
Takeover Proposal); or

 

 

(f) by the Company, in accordance with Section 4.02(e).

 

 

SECTION 7.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation
on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other than the provisions of the
last sentence of Section 5.02, Section 5.06, this Section 7.02 and Article
VIII, which provisions shall survive such termination; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall relieve the Company, Parent or Sub from liability for
any willful and material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION 7.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
at any time before or after receipt of the Stockholder Approval; provided,
however, that after such approval has been obtained, there shall be made no
amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the
Company without such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

 

 

SECTION 7.04. Extension; Waiver. The conditions to each of the parties'
obligations to consummate the Share Exchange are for the sole benefit of such
party and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws. At any time prior to the Effective Time, (a)
the parties may mutually extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) to the extent permitted
by Law, any inaccuracies in any representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto may be waived by the
party benefiting from such representation or warranty or (c) subject to the
proviso to the first sentence of Section 7.03 and to the extent permitted by
Law, compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein may
be waived by the party benefiting from such compliance. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.
