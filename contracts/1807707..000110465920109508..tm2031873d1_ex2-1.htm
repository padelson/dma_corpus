at UBS Group AG (the &ldquo;<B><U>Trust Account</U></B>&rdquo;). The monies of such Trust Account are invested in United States
Government securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule&nbsp;2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, and held in trust by Continental (the &ldquo;<B><U>Trustee</U></B>&rdquo;) pursuant to the Investment
Management Trust Agreement, dated as of May&nbsp;19, 2020, between Novus and the Trustee (the &ldquo;<B><U>Trust Agreement</U></B>&rdquo;).
The Trust Agreement has not been amended or modified and is valid and in full force and effect and is enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Remedies Exceptions. Novus has complied in all material respects with the terms of the Trust Agreement
and is not in breach thereof or default thereunder and there does not exist under the Trust Agreement any event which, with the
giving of notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default by Novus or the Trustee. There are no separate
contracts, agreements, side letters or other understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied): (i)&nbsp;between
Novus and the Trustee that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the Novus SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any
material respect; or (ii)&nbsp;to the knowledge of Novus, that would entitle any person (other than stockholders of Novus who
shall have elected to redeem their shares of Novus Common Stock pursuant to the Novus Organizational Documents) to any portion
of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released except:
(A)&nbsp;to pay income and franchise taxes from any interest income earned in the Trust Account; and (B)&nbsp;upon the exercise
of Redemption Rights in accordance with the provisions of the Novus Organizational Documents. As of the date hereof, there are
no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Novus, threatened in writing with respect to the Trust Account. Upon consummation of
the Merger and notice thereof to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement, Novus shall cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee
shall thereupon be obligated to, release to Novus as promptly as practicable, the Trust Funds in accordance with the Trust Agreement
at which point the Trust Account shall terminate; provided, however that the liabilities and obligations of Novus due and owing
or incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due, including all amounts payable (a)&nbsp;to stockholders
of Novus who shall have exercised their Redemption Rights, (b)&nbsp;with respect to filings, applications and/or other actions
taken pursuant to this Agreement required under Law, (c)&nbsp;to the Trustee for fees and costs incurred in accordance with the

in connection with its efforts to effect the Merger (including fees owed by Novus to EarlyBirdCapital,&nbsp;Inc., pursuant to
that certain Business Combination Marketing Agreement, dated May&nbsp;19, 2020, between EarlyBirdCapital,&nbsp;Inc. and Novus).
As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein and the compliance by
the Company with its respective obligations hereunder, Novus has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the use of
funds in the Trust Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not be available to Novus at the

(i)&nbsp;the Action in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)&nbsp;the venue of such Action is improper or (iii)&nbsp;this

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition
to any other remedy at law or in equity without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without
bond or other security being required, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the parties hereto hereby further acknowledges that the existence of any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does
not diminish the availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any other injunctive relief. Each party hereto
hereby further agrees that in the event of any action by any other party for specific performance or injunctive relief, it will
not assert that a remedy at law or other remedy would be adequate or that specific performance or injunctive relief in respect
of such breach or violation should not be available on the grounds that money damages are adequate or any other grounds.</FONT></P>

or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any claim for indemnification,
the Corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct
that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed. In connection with any claim by an officer of the Corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the Corporation) for
advances, the Corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such person
acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his or her
conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper
in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor
an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that
the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant
has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or officer to enforce a right to indemnification
or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified,
or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article&nbsp;IV or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.</P>

which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the corporation a revocation
of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.</P>

only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an &ldquo;<B><I>undertaking</I></B>&rdquo;), by or on behalf

</B>Without the necessity of entering into an express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and executive
officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in
a contract between the corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to indemnification or advances granted by this
section to a director or executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware if (i)&nbsp;the claim for indemnification or advances is denied by the Board of Directors, in
whole or in part, or (ii)&nbsp;no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. To the extent
permitted by law, the claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also
the expense of prosecuting the claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In connection with any claim for indemnification,
the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct
that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed. In connection with any claim by an executive officer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the
corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence
that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not reasonably believe to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without reasonable cause
to believe that his or her conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of
the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL
or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal
counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action
or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or executive
officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director
or executive officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this section or otherwise shall
be on the corporation.</P>
