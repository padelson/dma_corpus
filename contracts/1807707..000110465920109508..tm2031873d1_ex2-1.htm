(c) In connection with the assumption of the Exchanged Options
and Converted RSU Awards pursuant to Section 3.01(b), Novus may assume the
Company Option Plan as of the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
Novus and the Company, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that
are necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options and Company
RSUs pursuant to this subsection, or to cause any disposition or acquisition
of equity securities of Novus pursuant to this _Section 3.01(c)_ by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  " _Exchange Act_ "),
with respect to Novus or who will (or is reasonably expected to) become
subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Novus to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Effective as of the Effective Time,
Novus shall file an appropriate registration statement or registration
statements with respect to the shares of Novus Common Stock subject to such
Exchanged Options and Converted RSU Awards and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and

Interim Period Convertible Notes. All of the Company Interim Period
Convertible Notes converted into shares of Novus Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, any liens securing

Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article III_,
the number of shares of Novus Common Stock sufficient to deliver the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
(such shares of Novus Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.02(c)_, being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Novus shall cause the
Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to pay the Per Share
Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. Except as contemplated by _Section 3.02(c)_ hereof, the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Effective Time and in any event within two (2) Business
Days following the Effective Time (but in no event prior to the Effective
Time), Novus shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each holder of
Company Common Stock, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented by book-entry (including shares of Company Common Stock resulting
from the conversion of Company Preferred Stock described in _Section
3.01(a)_) the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 3.01_, and such Company Common Stock shall forthwith
be cancelled.

  



  

(c) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Per Share
Merger Consideration payable upon conversion of the Company Common
Stock (including shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the conversion
of Company Preferred Stock described in _Section 3.01(a)_) in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock.

  



  

(d) _Adjustments to Per Share Consideration_. The Per Share
Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Novus Common Stock occurring on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Novus, upon demand,
and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied
with this _Section 3.02_ shall thereafter look only to Novus for the Per
Share Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Company Common Stock as of a date which is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Novus free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Novus or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Common
Stock (including shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the conversion
of Company Preferred Stock described in _Section 3.01(a)_ and any Company
Restricted Shares) for any Novus Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law in accordance with this _Section
3.02_.

  



  

(g) _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub,
Novus, and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ ") or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  



  

   

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or shares
representing fractional shares of Novus Common Stock shall be issued upon the
exchange of Company Common Stock and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of
Novus or a holder of shares of Novus Common Stock. In lieu of any fractional
share of Novus Common Stock to which each holder of Company Common Stock
would otherwise be entitled, the Exchange Agent shall round up or down to the
nearest whole share of Novus Common Stock, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up.
No cash settlements shall be made with respect to fractional shares
eliminated by rounding.

  



  

Section 3.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law.

  



  

Section 3.04 _Appraisal Rights_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, shares of Company Common
Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by stockholders of the Company who shall have neither voted in favor
of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded
properly in writing appraisal for such Company Common Stock in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL and otherwise complied with all of the provisions
of the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters' rights
shall not be converted into, and such stockholders shall have no right to
receive, the Per Share Merger Consideration unless and until such stockholder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. Any stockholder of the Company who fails
to perfect or who effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its
rights to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock under Section
262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to
have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon
surrender, if applicable, in the manner provided in _Section 3.02(b)_, of
the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (as the case may be).

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give Novus (i) prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company and
any withdrawals of such demands, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Novus (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable principles
(the " _Remedies Exceptions_ "). The Company Board has approved this Agreement
and the Transactions, and such approvals are sufficient so that the

approvals, consents, authorizations and notices disclosed in _Section
4.05a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, including the Written Consent,
and other notifications provided in the ordinary course of business have been

both, would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien (other than any Permitted Lien) on any material property
or asset of any Company Group Member pursuant to, any Material Contract,
except, with respect to _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for any such conflicts,

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will
not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing

any, of the Exchange Act, state securities or "blue sky" laws (" _Blue Sky
Laws_ ") and state takeover laws, the pre-merger notification requirements of
the HSR Act, and filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by the DGCL, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not have or would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

and the Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all material
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental

own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, including the certification of the Company as a Certified
B Corporation by B Lab, Inc. (the " _Company Permits_ "), except where the
failure to have such Company Permits would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the
Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing. No Company Group Member is in conflict with, or in default, breach
or violation of, (a) any Law applicable to such Company Group Member or by
which any property or asset of such Company Group Member is bound or
affected, or (b) any Material Contract or Company Permit, except, in each

Novus SEC Report that is a registration statement, or include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, in the case of any other Novus SEC
Report. Each director and executive officer of Novus has filed with the SEC on
a timely basis all documents required with respect to Novus by Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Regulation S-K, as applicable, throughout the periods indicated (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents,
in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations,
changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of Novus as at the respective
dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, (subject,
in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to

Novus's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to

officer to material information required to be included in Novus's periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act.

reporting that are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial

reflect, in all material respects, its transactions and dispositions of
assets; (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and its board of directors; and (iv) regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on its
financial statements. Novus has delivered to the Company a true and complete
copy of any disclosure (or, if unwritten, a summary thereof) by any
representative of Novus to Novus's independent auditors relating to any
material weaknesses in internal controls and any significant deficiencies in
the design or operation of internal controls that would adversely affect the
ability of Novus to record, process, summarize and report financial data.

reporting of Novus. Since June 30, 2020, there have been no material changes
in Novus internal control over financial reporting.

independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls
utilized by Novus, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
Novus's management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of

Section 5.13 _Novus Trust Fund_. As of the date of this
Agreement, Novus has no less than $100,000,000 in the trust fund
established by Novus for the benefit of its public stockholders (the " _Trust
Fund_ ") maintained in a trust account at UBS Group AG (the " _Trust Account_
"). The monies of such Trust Account are invested in United States Government
securities or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and held in
trust by Continental (the " _Trustee_ ") pursuant to the
Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of May 19, 2020, between
Novus and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement has
not been amended or modified and is valid and in full force and effect and is
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Remedies Exceptions.
Novus has complied in all material respects with the terms of the Trust
Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default thereunder and there does
not exist under the Trust Agreement any event which, with the giving of
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default by
Novus or the Trustee. There are no separate contracts, agreements, side
letters or other understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or
implied): (i) between Novus and the Trustee that would cause the description
of the Trust Agreement in the Novus SEC Reports to be inaccurate in
any material respect; or (ii) to the knowledge of Novus, that would entitle
any person (other than stockholders of Novus who shall have elected to redeem
their shares of Novus Common Stock pursuant to the Novus Organizational
Documents) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account. Prior to the
Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be released
except: (A) to pay income and franchise taxes from any interest income earned
in the Trust Account; and (B) upon the exercise of Redemption Rights in
accordance with the provisions of the Novus Organizational Documents. As of
the date hereof, there are no Actions pending or, to the knowledge of Novus,
threatened in writing with respect to the Trust Account. Upon consummation
of the Merger and notice thereof to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, Novus shall cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall thereupon
be obligated to, release to Novus as promptly as practicable, the Trust Funds
in accordance with the Trust Agreement at which point the Trust Account shall
terminate; provided, however that the liabilities and obligations of Novus due
and owing or incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as and
when due, including all amounts payable (a) to stockholders of Novus who
shall have exercised their Redemption Rights, (b) with respect to filings,
applications and/or other actions taken pursuant to this Agreement required
under Law, (c) to the Trustee for fees and costs incurred in accordance with
the Trust Agreement; and (d) to third parties (e.g., professionals, printers,
etc.) who have rendered services to Novus in connection with its efforts to
effect the Merger (including fees owed by Novus to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc.,
pursuant to that certain Business Combination Marketing Agreement, dated May
19, 2020, between EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and Novus). As of the date hereof,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
herein and the compliance by the Company with its respective obligations
hereunder, Novus has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
use of funds in the Trust Account will not be satisfied or funds available in
the Trust Account will not be available to Novus at the Effective Time.

and Covenants_

  



  

. None of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other
agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any
breach of such representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Closing and
all such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other
agreements shall terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the Closing (and
there shall be no liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except for
(a) those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms
expressly apply in whole or in part after the Closing and then only with
respect to any breaches occurring after the Closing and (b) this _Article
X_ and any corresponding definitions set forth in _Article I_.

  



  

Section 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire agreement
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede,
except as set forth in _Section 7.04(b)_, all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality
Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger,
by operation of law or otherwise) by any party without the prior express
written consent of the other parties hereto.

  



  

Section 10.05 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto,
and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than _Section 7.08_
(which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and
may be enforced by such persons).

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

Section 10.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that
State. All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall
be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware Chancery Court; provided,
that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Delaware Chancery Court,
then any such Action may be brought in any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or any other Delaware state court. The parties hereto hereby (a)
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for
themselves and with respect to their respective properties for the purpose of
any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party
hereto, and (b) agree not to commence any Action relating thereto except in
the courts described above in Delaware, other than Actions in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by
any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further
agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process and the parties further waive any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by
such courts.

  



  

Section 10.07 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties
hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any
right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly
or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or
the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that
it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and
the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers
and certifications in this _Section 10.07_.

  



  

Section 10.08 _Headings_. The descriptive headings
contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be
executed and delivered (including by facsimile or portable document format
(pdf) transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

Section 10.10 _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a party to
cause the other parties to consummate the Transactions. It is agreed that the
parties are entitled to enforce specifically the performance of terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each such
party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Such Action shall be brought in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if that court does not have
jurisdiction, any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to any applicable Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each of the parties
hereby further waives any defense in any action for specific performance that
a remedy at law would be adequate.

  



  

(b) The parties further agree that the Company would suffer
irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties to the
Subscription Agreements do not perform their obligations under the provisions
of such Subscription Agreements (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them thereunder to consummate the Private Placement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (i) if the parties to the Subscription
Agreements do not perform their obligations under the provisions of the
Subscription Agreements, then (1) the Company shall have the right to either
(at the Company's election) (I) on behalf of Novus, seek an injunction,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of such
Subscription Agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
thereof, without proof of damages or (II) seek an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to cause Novus to prevent breaches of
the Subscription Agreements and to cause Novus to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions thereof, without proof of damages, in each case of the
foregoing clauses (I) and (II), prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which it is entitled under this Agreement, and (2) Novus shall
not object or otherwise oppose any Action pursuant to which the Company is
exercising its rights pursuant to the foregoing clause (1), and (ii) the right
of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without
that right, none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
prior to the Outside Date any party initiates an Action to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, then the Outside Date will be automatically
extended by: (A) the amount of time during which such Action is pending plus
20 Business Days; or (B) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such Action.

Section 10.11 _No Recourse_. All claims, obligations,
liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise
under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this
Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in connection
with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and
such representations and warranties are those solely of) the persons that are
expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the "
_Contracting Parties_ ") except as set forth in this _Section 10.11_. No
person who is not a Contracting Party, including any current, former or
future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative or assignee of, and
any financial advisor or lender to, any Contracting Party, or any current,
former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative or assignee
of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute)
for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under,
out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or
based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance, or breach, except with respect to actual and
intentional common law fraud under the laws of the State of Delaware ("
_Fraud_ ") against the person who committed such willful misconduct or Fraud,
and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, each Contracting
Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of
action, and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates.

WHEREAS, prior to the closing of the Merger, the Company will hold a meeting
of the Company's stockholders to consider, among other things, (1) the

incentive plan, in accordance with the BCA, (5) the approval and adoption of
an employee stock purchase plan, in accordance with the BCA, and (6) any other

WHEREAS, in connection with the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the
BCA, the Stockholders and the Company have entered into this Agreement to set
forth certain understandings among such parties, including with respect to
certain governance and voting matters.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

  



  

Article I

  

GOVERNANCE AND VOTING MATTERS

  



  

Section 1.1 _Board and Committees_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the approval of the Novus Proposals and the
consummation of the Merger, the Company will take all necessary action (to the
extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent such action is
consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board under Delaware law) to
cause the following to occur immediately after the effective time of the
Merger:

  



  

(i) The Board to consist of ten directors (each, a " _Director_
"), including Jonathan Webb, Kiran Bhatraju, Martha Stewart, Anna Mason, J.D.
Vance, Jeffrey Ubben, David Lee, David Chen, Greg Couch, and Robert Laikin;

  



  

(ii) The audit committee of the Board to consist of three

Anna Mason; and

  



  

(iv) The nominating and governance committee of the Board to
consist of three directors, including Jeffrey Ubben, as chair, David
Chen, and Robert Laikin.

  



  

(b) After the Closing, the Company will take all necessary action
(to the extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent such action is
consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board under Delaware law) to (i)
cause the Board to nominate and recommend for election to the Board at the
Company's annual meeting of stockholders in 2021 (the " _First Annual Meeting_
") each of the above-mentioned individuals (the " _Nominees_ "), each to
serve until their successors are duly elected and qualified, and (ii) cause
each applicable Nominee to be included in the proxy statement prepared by
management of the Company in connection with the Company's soliciting proxies
or consents in favor of the foregoing for the First Annual Meeting, and at
every adjournment or postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by
written resolution of the stockholders of the Company or the Board with
respect to the election of members of the Board at the First Annual Meeting.

  



  

(c) If a Nominee is not elected because of such Nominee's death,
disability, disqualification, withdrawal as a nominee or for any other
reason, the Stockholders holding a majority of the shares of Novus Common
Stock shall be entitled to designate promptly another Nominee and the
Stockholders and the Company shall take all necessary and desirable actions
within its control such that the director position for which such Nominee was
nominated shall not be filled pending such designation or the size of the
Board shall be increased by one and such vacancy shall be filled with such
successor Nominee within ten days of such designation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, the director position for which such Nominee was
nominated shall not be filled pending such designation and
appointment, unless the Stockholders fail to designate such Nominee for more
than 30 days, after which the Company may appoint an interim
successor nominee who may serve as a director if duly elected until the
Stockholders make such designation. The Stockholders shall not be obligated
to designate all (or any) of the directors they are entitled to designate
pursuant to this Agreement but the failure to do so shall not constitute a
waiver of their rights hereunder.

  



  

(d) The Company shall (i) purchase directors' and officers'
liability insurance in an amount and pursuant to terms determined by the
Board to be reasonable and customary and (ii) for so long as any Director to
the Board nominated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement serves as a
Director of the Company, maintain such coverage with respect to such
Directors.

  



  

Section 1.2 _Voting_. Subject to the approval of the Novus
Proposals and the consummation of the Merger, the Stockholders shall vote, or
provide a written consent or proxy with respect to, their shares of the Novus
Common Stock in favor of each of the Nominees and/or other person who has
been recommended by the Board for such appointment or nomination in accordance
with Section 1.1(c) at the First Annual Meeting and at every adjournment or
postponement thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of
the stockholders of the Company or the Board with respect to the election of
members of the Board with respect to the First Annual Meeting.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Restrictions on Other Agreements_. The
Stockholders shall not, directly or indirectly, grant any proxy or enter into
or agree to be bound by any voting trust, agreement or arrangement of any
kind with respect to their shares of Common Stock if and to the extent the
terms thereof conflict with the provisions of this Agreement (whether or not
such proxy, voting trust, agreement or agreements are with other holders of
shares of Common Stock that are not parties to this Agreement or otherwise).

the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which, taken together, shall be considered one and the same agreement.

waived by each of the parties hereto. Each party hereto further agrees that,

Agreement, each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably (a) submits to the

_subsection 2.1.4_ and _Section 2.4_ hereof, at any time and from time to
time on or after the date that is 90 days prior to the expiration of the lock-
up provisions set forth in the Lock-up Agreement between the Company and the
New Holders being entered into as of the Effective Date, New Holders
holding at least a majority in interest of the then-outstanding number of
Registrable Securities held by all New Holders (such New Holders, the
"Demanding Holders"), may make a written demand for Registration of all or
part of their Registrable Securities on Form S-3 ("Form S-3") (or, if Form
S-3 is not available to be used by the Company at such time, on Form S-1 or
another appropriate form permitting Registration of such Registrable
Securities for resale by such Demanding Holders), which written demand shall
describe the amount and type of securities to be included in such Registration
and the intended method(s) of distribution thereof (such written demand a
"Demand Registration"). The Company shall, within ten (10) days of the
Company's receipt of the Demand Registration, notify, in writing, all other
Holders of Registrable Securities of such demand, and each Holder of
Registrable Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or a portion of
such Holder's Registrable Securities in a Registration pursuant to a Demand
Registration (each such Holder that includes all or a portion of such
Holder's Registrable Securities in such Registration, a "Demand Requesting
Holder") shall so notify the Company, in writing, within five (5) days after
the receipt by the Holder of the notice from the Company.  Upon receipt by
the Company of any such written notification from a Demand Requesting
Holder(s) to the Company, such Demand Requesting Holder(s) shall be entitled
to have their Registrable Securities included in a Registration pursuant to a
Demand Registration and the Company shall effect, as soon thereafter as
practicable, but not more than forty five (45) days immediately after the
Company's receipt of the Demand Registration, the Registration of all
Registrable Securities requested by the Demanding Holders and Demand
Requesting Holders pursuant to such Demand Registration. Under no
circumstances shall the Company be obligated to effect more than an aggregate
of three (3) Registrations pursuant to a Demand Registration under this
_subsection 2.1.1_.

  



  

2.1.2 _Effective Registration_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of _subsection 2.1.1 _above or any other part of this Agreement, a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration shall not count as a
Registration unless and until (i) the Registration Statement filed with the
Commission with respect to a Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration
has been declared effective by the Commission and (ii) the Company has
complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with respect
thereto; provided, further, that if, after such Registration Statement has
been declared effective, an offering of Registrable Securities in a
Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration is subsequently interfered with
by any stop order or injunction of the Commission, federal or state court or
any other governmental agency the Registration Statement with respect to such
Registration shall be deemed not to have been declared effective, unless and
until, (i) such stop order or injunction is removed, rescinded or
otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders initiating such Demand Registration thereafter affirmatively elect to
continue with such Registration and accordingly notify the Company in writing,
but in no event later than five (5) days, of such election; provided,

Registration becomes effective or is subsequently terminated.

_subsection 2.1.4_ and _Section 2.4_ hereof, if a majority-in-interest of
the Demanding Holders so advise the Company as part of their Demand
Registration that the offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Demand Registration shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering, then the
right of such Demanding Holder or Demand Requesting Holder (if any) to
include its Registrable Securities in such Registration shall be conditioned
upon such Holder's participation in such Underwritten Offering and the
inclusion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Underwritten
Offering to the extent provided herein. All such Holders proposing to
distribute their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering
under this _subsection 2.1.3_ shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten Offering
by the majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating the Demand
Registration.

  



  

   



 



    



  

2.1.4 _Reduction of Underwritten Offering_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration pursuant to a
Demand Registration, in good faith, advises the Company, the Demanding
Holders and the Demand Requesting Holders (if any) in writing that the dollar
amount or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and the
Demand Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all
other Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell
and the Common Stock, if any, as to which a Registration has been requested
pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights held
by any other stockholders who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar
amount or maximum number of equity securities that can be sold in the
Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price,
the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of such
offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as
applicable, the "Maximum Number of Securities"), then the Company shall
include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: (i) first, the Registrable
Securities of the Demanding Holders and the Demand Requesting Holders (if any)
(pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Demanding Holder and Demand Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be
included in such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate number of
Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and Demand Requesting
Holders have requested be included in such Underwritten Registration) that can
be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached
under the foregoing clause (i), Common Stock or other equity securities that
the Company desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number
of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii),
Common Stock or other equity securities of other persons or entities that the
Company is obligated to register in a Registration pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

2.1.5 _Demand Registration Withdrawal_. A majority-in-interest
of the New Holders, in the case of a Registration _under subsection 2.1.1_
initiated by the New Holders, or a majority-in-interest of the Demand
Requesting Holders (if any), pursuant to a Registration under _subsection
2.2.1_, shall have the right to withdraw from a Registration pursuant to such
Demand Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification
to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of
their intention to withdraw from such Registration prior to the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to the
Registration of their Registrable Securities pursuant to such Demand
Registration. If a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders initiating
a Demand Registration or a majority-in-interest of the Demand Requesting
Holders (if any), withdraws from a proposed offering pursuant to this
_Section 2.1.5_, then such registration shall not count as a Demand
Registration provided for in _Section 2.1_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with a Registration pursuant to a
Demand Registration prior to its withdrawal under this _subsection 2.1.5._

  



  

Section 2.2 Piggyback Registration.

hereof, the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under
the Securities Act with respect to an offering of equity securities, or
securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or
convertible into equity securities, for its own account or for the account of
stockholders of the Company (or by the Company and by the stockholders of the
Company including, without limitation, pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof),
other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with any employee
stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of
securities solely to the Company's existing stockholders, (iii) for an
offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the Company,
(iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, or (v) filed pursuant to _Section
2.3_ hereof, then the Company shall give written notice of such proposed
filing to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities then outstanding as
soon as practicable but not less than ten (10) days before the anticipated
filing date of such Registration Statement, which notice shall (A) describe
the amount and type of securities to be included in such offering, the
intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing
Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, in such offering, and (B) offer to all
of the Holders of Registrable Securities the opportunity to register the sale
of such number of Registrable Securities as such Holders may request in
writing within five (5) days after receipt of such written notice (such
Registration a "Piggyback Registration"). The Company shall, in good faith,
cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback
Registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter
or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to permit the Registrable
Securities requested by the Holders pursuant to this _subsection 2.2.1_ to
be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same terms and conditions as
any similar securities of the Company included in such Registration and to
permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. All such
Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an
Underwritten Offering under this _subsection 2.2.1_ shall enter into an
underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for
such Underwritten Offering by the Company.

Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Registration that is to be a
Piggyback Registration, in good faith, advises the Company and the Holders of
Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback Registration in writing
that the dollar amount or number of shares of Common Stock that the Company
desires to sell, taken together with (i) the shares of Common Stock, if any,
as to which Registration has been demanded pursuant to separate written
contractual arrangements with persons or entities other than the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder, (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which
registration has been requested pursuant to _Section 2.2_ hereof, and (iii)
the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been
requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-back
registration rights of other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum
Number of Securities, then:

  



  

(i) If the Registration is undertaken for the Company's account,
the Company shall include in any such Registration (A) first, Common Stock or
other equity securities that the Company desires to sell, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to
register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_
hereof, pro rata, based on the respective number of Registrable Securities
that each Holder has so requested, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; and (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and
(B), Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested
pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration rights of other
stockholders of the Company, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; and

  



  

(ii) If the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or
entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the
Company shall include in any such Registration (A) first, Common Stock or
other equity securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities,
other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that
the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clause (A), the Registrable Securities of Holders exercising their rights to
register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _subsection 2.2.1_, pro
rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each Holder
has requested be included in such Underwritten Registration and the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities that the Holders have requested to be
included in such Underwritten Registration, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses
(A) and (B), Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires
to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C), Common Stock or
other equity securities for the account of other persons or entities that the
Company is obligated to register pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

2.2.3 _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Holder of Registrable
Securities shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for
any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to the Company and the
Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of his, her or its intention to withdraw
from such Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement filed with the Commission with respect to such
Piggyback Registration. The Company (whether on its own good faith
determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons
pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration
Expenses incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its
withdrawal under this _subsection 2.2.3_.

Section 2.3 Resale Shelf Registration Rights

for an offering to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the
Securities Act or any successor thereto registering the resale from time to
time by Holders of all of the Registrable Securities held by Holders (the
"Resale Shelf Registration Statement"). The Resale Shelf Registration
Statement shall be on Form S-3 (or if Form S-3 is not available to be used by
the Company at such time, on Form S-1 or another appropriate form permitting
Registration of such Registrable Securities for resale). The Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable after filing, but no
later than the earlier of (i) the 60th calendar day (or 120th calendar day if
the Commission notifies the Company that it will "review" the Registration
Statement) following the closing of the Business Combination and (ii) ten (10)
Business Days after the date the Company is notified (orally or in writing,
whichever is earlier) by the Commission that the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not be subject to
further review (such earlier date, the "Effectiveness Deadline"). Once
effective, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective and to be
supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such
Registration Statement is available or, if not available, to ensure that
another Registration Statement is available, under the Securities Act at
all times until all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by
such Registration Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the
intended method(s) of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or
have ceased to be Registrable Securities. The Registration Statement filed
with the Commission pursuant to this _subsection 2.3.1_ shall contain a
prospectus in such form as to permit any Holder to sell such Registrable
Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or
similar provision adopted by the Commission then in effect) at any time
beginning on the effective date for such Registration Statement (subject to
the restrictions provided in the Sponsor Restricted Stock Agreement and the
Lock-up Agreement between the Company and the New Holders, each being entered
into as of the date hereof), and shall provide that such
Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to any method or combination of
methods legally available to, and requested by, the Holders. If the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement is filed on Form S-1, then promptly following the
date upon which the Company becomes eligible to use a Registration Statement
on Form S-3, the Company shall file a post-effective amendment on Form S-3
to the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (an "S-3 Conversion").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Holders shall
not be entitled to reimbursement from the Company of Registration Expenses set
forth in clause (F) of the definition of "Registration Expenses" related to
an S-3 Conversion.

  



  

2.3.2 _Notification and Distribution of Materials_. The Company
shall notify the Holders in writing of the effectiveness of the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement as soon as practicable, and in any event within one
(1) Business Day after the Resale Shelf Registration Statement becomes
effective, and shall furnish to them, without charge, such number of copies of
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement (including any amendments,
supplements and exhibits), the Prospectus contained therein (including each
preliminary prospectus and all related amendments and supplements) and any
documents incorporated by reference in the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement or such other documents as the Holders may reasonably request in
order to facilitate the sale of the Registrable Securities in the manner
described in the Resale Shelf Registration Statement.

  



  

   



 



    



  

2.3.3 _Amendments and Supplements_. Subject to the provisions of
_Section 2.3.1_ above, the Company shall promptly prepare and file with the
Commission from time to time such amendments and supplements to the Resale
Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary to keep the Resale Shelf Registration Statement effective and
to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all the Registrable Securities. If any Resale Shelf
Registration Statement filed pursuant to _Section 2.3.1_ is filed on Form
S-3 and thereafter the Company becomes ineligible to use Form S-3 for
secondary sales, the Company shall promptly notify the Holders of such
ineligibility and use its best efforts to file a shelf registration on an
appropriate form as promptly as practicable to replace the shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 and have the such replacement Resale Shelf Registration
Statement declared effective as promptly as practicable and to cause
such replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement to remain effective, and
to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such
Resale Shelf Registration Statement is available or, if not available, that
another Resale Shelf Registration Statement is available, for the resale of
all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable
Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities; provided, however, that
at any time the Company once again becomes eligible to use Form S-3, the
Company shall cause such replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement to be
amended, or shall file a new replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement,
such that the Resale Shelf Registration Statement is once again on Form S-3.

  



  

2.3.4 Notwithstanding the registration obligations set forth in
this _Section 2.3_, in the event the Commission informs the Company that
all of the Registrable Securities cannot, as a result of the application of
Rule 415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single
registration statement, the Company agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the
holders thereof and use its reasonable best efforts to file amendments to the
Resale Shelf Registration Statement as required by the Commission and/or (ii)
withdraw the Resale Shelf Registration Statement and file a new registration
statement (a "New Registration Statement"), on Form S-3, or if Form S-3 is
not then available to the Company for such registration statement, on such
other form available to register for resale the Registrable Securities as a
secondary offering; provided, however, that prior to filing such amendment or
New Registration Statement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all of the
Registrable Securities in accordance with any publicly-available written or
oral guidance, comments, requirements or requests of the Commission staff
(the "SEC Guidance"), including without limitation, the Manual of Publicly
Available Telephone Interpretations D.29. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation of the number
of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a
particular Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and
notwithstanding that the Company used diligent efforts to advocate with
the Commission for the registration of all or a greater number of Registrable
Securities), unless otherwise directed in writing by a Holder as to its
Registrable Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered
on such Registration Statement will be reduced in order to include first, the
number of shares of Common Stock included in the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement that are held by PIPE Investors (as defined in the Business
Combination Agreement) and the number of shares of Common Stock included in
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement that were issued upon conversion of
Company Interim Period Convertible Notes (as defined in the Business
Combination Agreement), and second, the Registrable Securities under this
Agreement other than the shares issued upon conversion of Company Interim
Period Convertible Notes, on a pro rata basis based on the total number of
Registrable Securities held by the Holders, subject to a determination by the
Commission that certain Holders must be reduced first based on the number of
Registrable Securities held by such Holders. In the event the Company amends
the Resale Shelf Registration Statement or files a New Registration
Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or (ii) above, the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to file with the Commission, as promptly
as allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance provided to the Company or to
registrants of securities in general, one or more registration statements on
Form S-3 or such other form available to register for resale those
Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on the Resale Shelf
Registration Statement, as amended, or the New Registration Statement.

  



  

2.3.5 Registrations effected pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall
not be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

  



  

Section 2.4 Restrictions on Registration Rights. If (A) during the
period starting with the date sixty (60) days prior to the Company's good
faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date one hundred
and twenty (120) days after the effective date of, a Company initiated
Registration and provided that the Company has delivered written notice to the
Holders prior to receipt of a Demand Registration pursuant to _subsection
2.1.1_ and it continues to actively employ, in good faith, all reasonable
efforts to cause the applicable Registration Statement to become effective;
(B) the Holders have requested an Underwritten Registration and the Company
and the Holders are unable to obtain the commitment of underwriters to firmly
underwrite the offer; or (C) in the good faith judgment of the Board such
Registration would be materially detrimental to the Company and the
Board concludes as a result that it is essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement at such time, then in each case the Company shall
furnish to such Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board
stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be materially
detrimental to the Company for such Registration Statement to be filed in the
near future and that it is therefore essential to defer the filing of such
Registration Statement. In such event, the Company shall have the right to
defer a filing pursuant to Section 2.1 for a period of not more than thirty
(30) days; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not defer its
obligation in this manner more than once in any 12 month period.

  



  

   



 



    



  

ARTICLE III 
 COMPANY PROCEDURES

  



  

Section 3.1 General Procedures. If at any time on or after the Effective
Time the Company is required to effect the Registration of
Registrable Securities, the Company shall use its best efforts to effect such
Registration to permit the sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance
with the intended plan of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto the
Company shall, as expeditiously as possible:

  



  

3.1.1 prepare and file with the Commission as soon as practicable
a Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to
become effective and remain effective until all Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement have been sold;

  



  

3.1.2 prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
post-effective amendments to the Registration Statement, and such
supplements to the Prospectus, as may be reasonably requested by the Holders
or any Underwriter of Registrable Securities or as may be required by the
rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by
the Company or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder to
keep the Registration Statement effective until all Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement are sold in accordance with the
intended plan of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or
supplement to the Prospectus;

  



  

3.1.3 prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the
Underwriters, if any, and the Holders of Registrable Securities included in
such Registration, and such Holders' legal counsel, copies of such
Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, each amendment and supplement
to such Registration Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto
and documents incorporated by reference therein), the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement (including each preliminary Prospectus), and such
other documents as the Underwriters and the Holders of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration or the legal counsel for any such
Holders may request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities owned by such Holders;

  



  

3.1.4 prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use
its best efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement under such securities or
"blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as the Holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement (in light of
their intended plan of distribution) may request and (ii) take such action
necessary to cause such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of
the Company and do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or
advisable to enable the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities in such jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be required to qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction
where it would not otherwise be required to qualify or take any action to
which it would be subject to general service of process or taxation in any
such jurisdiction where it is not then otherwise so subject;

  



  

3.1.5 cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed;

  



  

3.1.6 provide a transfer agent or warrant agent, as applicable,
and registrar for all such Registrable Securities no later than the
effective date of such Registration Statement;

  



  

3.1.7 advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly
after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of
any stop order by the Commission suspending the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for
such purpose and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order
should be issued;

  



  

   



 



    



  

3.1.8 advise each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement, promptly after the Company receives notice
thereof, of the time when such registration statement has been declared
effective or a supplement to any Prospectus forming a part of
such registration statement has been filed;

  



  

3.1.9 at least five (5) days prior to the filing of any
Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to
such Registration Statement or Prospectus, furnish a copy thereof to each
seller of such Registrable Securities or its counsel;

  



  

3.1.10 notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to
such Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the
Prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in
effect, includes a Misstatement, and then to correct such Misstatement as set
forth in _Section 3.4_ hereof;

  



  

3.1.11 permit a representative of the Holders, the Underwriters, if
any, and any attorney or accountant retained by such Holders or
Underwriter to participate, at each such person's own expense, in the
preparation of the Registration Statement, and cause the Company's officers,
directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with
the Registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that such representatives or
Underwriters enter into a confidentiality agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, prior to the release or disclosure of
any such information;

  



  

3.1.12 obtain a "cold comfort" letter from the Company's independent
registered public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Registration,
in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by
"cold comfort" letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably request,
and reasonably satisfactory to such managing Underwriter;

  



  

3.1.13 on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale
pursuant to an Underwritten Registration, obtain an opinion and
negative assurance letter, each dated such date, of counsel representing the
Company for the purposes of such Underwritten Registration, addressed to the
Underwriters covering such legal matters with respect to the Underwritten
Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given as the managing
Underwriter may reasonably request and as are customarily included in such
opinions and negative assurance letters, and reasonably satisfactory to such
managing Underwriter;

  



  

3.1.14 in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and
perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and
customary form, with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

  



  

3.1.15 make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least
twelve (12) months beginning with the first day of the Company's first full
calendar quarter after the effective date of the Registration Statement which
satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158
thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission);

  



  

3.1.16 if the Registration involves the Registration of Registrable
Securities involving gross proceeds in excess of $50,000,000, use
its reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of the Company to
participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably
requested by the Underwriter in any Underwritten Offering; and

  



  

3.1.17 otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take
such customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in
connection with such Registration.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 3.2 Registration Expenses. Except as provided in Section 2.3.1
with respect to an S-3 Conversion, the Registration Expenses of all
Registrations shall be borne by the Company. It is acknowledged by the
Holders that the Holders shall bear all incremental selling expenses relating
to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters' commissions and
discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs and, other than as set
forth in the definition of " _Registration Expenses_ ," all reasonable fees
and expenses of any legal counsel representing the Holders.

  



  

Section 3.3 Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings.
No person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity
securities of the Company pursuant to a Registration initiated by the Company
hereunder unless such person (i) agrees to sell such person's securities on
the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Company
and (ii) completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other
customary documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements.

  



  

Section 3.4 Suspension of Sales. Upon receipt of written notice from
the Company that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains a
Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities until he, she or it has received copies of a
supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being
understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare and file such
supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such notice),
or until he, she or it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of
the Prospectus may be resumed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to delay or postpone the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, and from time to time to require
the Holders not to sell under a Registration Statement or to suspend the
effectiveness thereof, if the negotiation or consummation of a transaction by
the Company or its subsidiaries is pending or an event has occurred, which
negotiation, consummation or event the Board reasonably believes, upon the
advice of legal counsel, would require additional disclosure by the Company
in the Registration Statement of material information that the Company has a
bona fide business purpose for keeping confidential and the non-disclosure of
which in the Registration Statement would be expected, in the reasonable
determination of the Board, upon the advice of legal counsel, to cause the
Registration Statement to fail to comply with applicable disclosure
requirements (each such circumstance, a " _Suspension Event_ "); _provided,
however_ , that the Company may not delay or suspend a Registration Statement
on more than two occasions or for more than sixty (60) consecutive calendar
days, or more than ninety (90) total calendar days, in each case during any
twelve-month period. Upon receipt of any written notice from the Company of
the happening of any Suspension Event during the period that a Registration
Statement is effective or if as a result of a Suspension Event a Registration
Statement or related prospectus contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made (in the case of the prospectus) not misleading, the
Holders agrees that (i) they will immediately discontinue offers and sales of
the Shares under such Registration Statement (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, sales conducted pursuant to Rule 144) until the Holders receive copies
of a supplemental or amended prospectus (which the Company agrees to promptly
prepare) that corrects the misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to above
and receives notice that any post-effective amendment has become effective or
unless otherwise notified by the Company that it may resume such offers and
sales, and (ii) they will maintain the confidentiality of any information
included in such written notice delivered by the Company unless otherwise
required by law or subpoena. If so directed by the Company, the Holders will
deliver to the Company or, in each Holder's sole discretion destroy, all
copies of the prospectus covering the Shares in such Holder's possession;
provided, however, that this obligation to deliver or destroy all copies of
the prospectus covering the Shares shall not apply (i) to the extent the
Holder is required to retain a copy of such prospectus (a) in order to comply
with applicable legal, regulatory, self-regulatory or
professional requirements or (b) in accordance with a bona fide pre-existing
document retention policy or (ii) to copies stored electronically on archival
servers as a result of automatic data back-up.

  



  

Section 3.5 Reporting Obligations. As long as any Holder shall own
Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a
reporting company under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period)
all reports required to be filed by the Company after the date hereof pursuant
to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish the
Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings. The Company
further covenants that it shall take such further action as any Holder may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
such Holder to sell shares of Common Stock held by such Holder without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or any successor
rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), including providing any legal
opinions. Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such
Holder a written certification of a duly authorized officer as to whether it
has complied with such requirements.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 3.6 Limitations on Registration Rights. From and after the date
of this Agreement, other than the registration rights granted in
subscription agreements with the PIPE Investors (as defined in the Business
Combination Agreement) and the Company Interim Period Convertible Notes (as
defined in the Business Combination Agreement), the Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities then outstanding, enter into any agreement with any holder or
prospective holder of any securities of the Company that would provide to
such holder registration rights on a basis more favorable than the
registration rights granted to the Holders herein.

  



  

ARTICLE IV 
 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION

  



  

Section 4.1 Indemnification

  



  

4.1.1 The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by
law, each Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and
agents and each person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation
by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or inaction
required of the Company in connection with any such registration, except
insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished
in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein.  The
Company shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers and directors and
each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with respect
to the indemnification of the Holder.

  



  

4.1.2 In connection with any Registration Statement in which a
Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall
furnish to the Company in writing such information and affidavits as the
Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration
Statement or Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify
the Company, its directors and officers and agents and each person who
controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement
of material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such
untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so
furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and
several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability of
each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and
limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. The Holders
of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their
officers, directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within
the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the
foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.

  



  

4.1.3 Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give
prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to
which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt
notice shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to
the extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party)
and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).  An
indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party
with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any
indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified
party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.
No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified party,
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot
be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such money is so paid
by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which
settlement does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

   



 



    



  

4.1.4 The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person
of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The
Company and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering
also agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any
indemnified party for contribution to such party in the event the
Company's or such Holder's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



  

4.1.5 If the indemnification provided under _Section 4.1_ hereof
from the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless
an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities
and expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the liability of any Holder under this _subsection 4.1.5_ shall be
limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such
offering giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in _subsections
4.1.1_ , _4.1.2_ and _4.1.3_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding.  The parties hereto agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_
were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation,
which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in
this _subsection 4.1.5_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities Act) shall be
entitled to contribution pursuant to this _subsection 4.1.5_ from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

  



  

ARTICLE V 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 5.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including _Schedule
A_ hereto) constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the
parties as to the matters covered herein and supersedes and replaces any prior
understanding, agreement or statement of intent, in each case, written or
oral, of any and every nature with respect thereto.

  



  

Section 5.2 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or
permitted to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon
receipt when delivered by hand, (b) upon transmission, if sent by facsimile
or electronic transmission (in each case with receipt verified by electronic
confirmation), or (c) one (1) Business Day after being sent by courier or
express delivery service, specifying next day delivery, with proof of receipt.
The addresses, email addresses and facsimile numbers for such notices and
communications are those set forth on the signature pages hereof, or such
other address, email address or facsimile numbers as may be designated in
writing hereafter, in the same manner, by any such person.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 5.3 Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement and the rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may
not be assigned or delegated by the Company in whole or in part. This
Agreement and the rights, duties and obligations of the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder may be freely assigned or delegated by such
Holder of Registrable Securities in conjunction with and to the extent of any
transfer of Registrable Securities by any such Holder. This Agreement and the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
each of the parties and the permitted assigns of the applicable holder of
Registrable Securities or of any assignee of the applicable holder of
Registrable Securities. This Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or
benefits on any persons that are not party hereto other than as expressly set
forth in Article 4 and this _Section 5.3_. No assignment by any party hereto
of such party's rights, duties and obligations hereunder shall be binding upon
or obligate the Company unless and until the Company shall have received (i)
written notice of such assignment and (ii) the written agreement of the
assignee, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to be bound by the
terms and provisions of this Agreement (which may be accomplished by an
addendum or certificate of joinder to this Agreement).

  



  

Section 5.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart and such
counterparts may be delivered by the parties hereto via facsimile or
electronic transmission.

  



  

Section 5.5 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or
modified, and any provision hereof may be waived, in whole or in part, at any
time pursuant to an agreement in writing executed by (i) the Company, (ii)
holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities held by the Original
Holders at such time, and (iii) holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities held by the New Holders at such time; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver hereof that
materially and adversely affects one Holder, solely in his, her or its
capacity as a holder of the shares of capital stock of the Company, in a
manner that is materially different from the other Holders (in such capacity)
shall require the consent of the Holder so affected. In the event that the
Company issues shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Company Interim
Period Convertible Notes (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement),
the holder(s) thereof shall become party to this Agreement solely upon
execution of a counterpart signature page and shall be deemed to be New
Holders for all purposes under this Agreement. Any failure by any party at
any time to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be
construed a waiver of such provision or any other provisions hereof.

  



  

Section 5.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 5.7 Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All
legal actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware Chancery Court;
provided, that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Delaware Chancery
Court, then any such legal action may be brought in any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court. The parties
hereto hereby (a) irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts for themselves and with respect to their respective
properties for the purpose of any action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) agree not to commence any
action relating thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware,
other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any
judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described
herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein
shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further waive
any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts
in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property
is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the action in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such action is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be

Re: Lock-Up Agreement

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

This letter (this " _Letter Agreement_ ") is being delivered to you in
accordance with the Business Combination Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the " _BCA_ ") entered into by and among Novus Capital
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), ORGA, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ ") and AppHarvest, Inc., a Delaware
public benefit corporation (" _AppHarvest_ "), pursuant to which, among other
things, Merger Sub will be merged with and into AppHarvest on the date hereof
(the " _Merger_ "), with AppHarvest surviving the Merger as a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company.

  



  

In order to induce the Company to proceed with the Merger and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the undersigned (the " _Securityholder_ ") hereby agrees with
the Company as follows:

  



  

1. Subject to the exceptions set forth herein, the Securityholder agrees not to, without the prior written consent of the board of directors of the Company, (i) sell, offer to sell, contract or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of or agree to dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder, any shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (" _Common Stock_ ") held by it immediately after the effective time of the Merger, any shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Common Stock held by it immediately after the effective time of the Merger, or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock held by it immediately after the effective time of the Merger (the " _Lock-up Shares_ "), (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of the Lock-up Shares, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise or (iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii) (the actions specified in clauses (i)-(iii), collectively, " _Transfer_ ") until 365 days after the closing date of the Merger (the " _Lock-Up Period_ "), subject to the early release provisions set forth in Section 3 below.

  



  

2. The restrictions set forth in paragraph 1 shall not apply to:

  



   | (i)| in the case of an entity, (A) to another entity that is an
affiliate (as defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended) of the undersigned, or to any investment fund or other
entity controlling, controlled by, managing or managed by or under common
control with the undersigned or affiliates of the undersigned or who shares a

beneficial owner of all of the outstanding equity securities or similar
interests; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| in the case of an entity that is a trust, to a trustor or

   | (viii)| transfers of any (A) shares of Common Stock or other
securities acquired as part of the Private Placements with PIPE Investors
(each as defined in the BCA) or issued in exchange for, or on conversion or
exercise of, any securities issued as part of the Private Placements with
PIPE Investors or (B) Company Interim Securities (as defined in the BCA)
or issued in exchange for, or on conversion or exercise of, any Company
Interim Securities; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ix)| transactions relating to Common Stock or other securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock acquired in
open market transactions after the effective time of the Merger, _provided_
that no such transaction is required to be, or is, publicly announced
(whether on Form 4, Form 5 or otherwise, other than a required filing
on Schedule 13F, 13G or 13G/A) during the Lock-Up Period; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (x)| the exercise of stock options or warrants to purchase shares of
Common Stock or the vesting of stock awards of Common Stock and any related
transfer of shares of Common Stock to the Company in connection therewith (x)
deemed to occur upon the "cashless" or "net" exercise of such options or
warrants or (y) for the purpose of paying the exercise price of such options
or warrants or for paying taxes due as a result of the exercise of such
options or warrants, the vesting of such options, warrants or stock awards,
or as a result of the vesting of such shares of Common Stock, it being
understood that all shares of Common Stock received upon such exercise,
vesting or transfer will remain subject to the restrictions of this Letter
Agreement during the Lock-Up Period; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (xi)| Transfers to the Company pursuant to any contractual arrangement

, that such plan does not provide for, or permit, the sale of any shares of
Common Stock during the Lock-Up Period and no public announcement or filing
is voluntarily made or required regarding such plan during the Lock-Up
Period; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

2

 



    



   | (xiii)| transactions in the event of completion of a liquidation,
merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of
the Company's securityholders having the right to exchange their shares of

---|---|--- 
  



   | (xiv)| transactions to satisfy any U.S. federal, state, or local
income tax obligations of the Securityholder (or its direct or indirect
owners) arising from a change in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Regulations_ ") after the date on which the BCA was
executed by the parties, and such change prevents the Merger from qualifying
as a "reorganization" pursuant to Section 368 of the Code (and the Merger
does not qualify for similar tax-free treatment pursuant to any successor or
other provision of the Code or Regulations taking into account such changes),
in each case solely and to the extent necessary to cover any tax liability as
a direct result of the transaction. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

 _provided, however_ , that (A) in the case of clauses (i) through (vii),
these permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement, in
substantially the form of this Letter Agreement (it being understood that any
references to "immediate family" in the agreement executed by such transferee
shall expressly refer only to the immediate family of the Securityholder and
not to the immediate family of the transferee), agreeing to be bound by these
Transfer restrictions. For purposes of this paragraph, "immediate
family" shall mean a spouse, domestic partner, child (including by adoption),
father, mother, brother or sister of the undersigned, and lineal descendant
(including by adoption) of the undersigned or of any of the foregoing persons;
and "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended[; and

  



  

 _provided, further_ , that with respect to the Securityholder, the Lock-up
Shares shall only include those shares of Common Stock that were purchased or
acquired by the Securityholder as part of the initial 2,500,000 founders
shares of the Company, the number of which is set forth on the signature page
hereto.]

  



  

3. With respect to 50% of the Lock-up Shares (half of which may be Restricted Shares, as defined in the Sponsor Restricted Stock Agreement by and among the Company, stockholders of the Company identified therein and AppHarvest) (the " _Early Release Shares_ "), the Lock-Up Period shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) 365 days after the closing date of the Merger or (ii) the day after the date on which the closing price of the Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 180 days after the closing date of the Merger. With respect to the shares held by the undersigned that are not Early Release Shares, the Lock-Up Period shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) 365 days after the closing date of the Merger or (ii) the closing of a sale, merger, liquidation, or exchange offer transaction after the closing date of the Merger.

  



  

4. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company, and any duly appointed transfer agent for the registration or transfer of the securities described therein, are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Letter Agreement.

  



  

5. This Letter Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby. This Letter Agreement may not be changed, amended, modified or waived (other than to correct a typographical error) as to any particular provision, except by a written instrument executed by the undersigned (i) Securityholder, (ii) the Company and (iii) the Board Designee of Novus listed on Exhibit H to the BCA or, if such person is not serving as a Director of the Company, Robert J. Laikin or Larry Paulson.

6. No party hereto may assign either this Letter Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in violation of this paragraph shall be void and ineffectual and shall not operate to transfer or assign any interest or title to the purported assignee. This Letter Agreement shall be binding on the Securityholder and each of its respective successors, heirs and assigns and permitted transferees.

  



  

7. This Letter Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction. The parties hereto (i) all agree that any action, proceeding, claim or dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to, this Letter Agreement shall be brought and enforced in the Delaware Chancery Court, and irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction and venue, which jurisdiction and venue shall be exclusive and (ii) waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and venue or that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.

  



  

8. This Letter Agreement shall terminate on the expiration of the Lock-up Period.

 _Execution_

  



  

SPONSOR RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT

  



  

This RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT, dated as of [•], 2020 (" _Agreement_ "), by
and among NOVUS CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Novus_ "),
the stockholders of Novus listed on Exhibit A hereto (the " _Stockholders_
") and AppHarvest, Inc., a Delaware public benefit corporation (the "
_Company_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, Novus was formed for the purpose of completing a merger, stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization,
reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more
businesses or entities.

  



  

WHEREAS, 2,500,000 shares of common stock of Novus, par value $0.0001 per
share, (" _Novus Common Stock_ ") are held in escrow (the  " _Escrow Shares_
") with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York corporation
(the " _Escrow Agent_ "), in accordance with that certain Stock Escrow
Agreement, by and among Novus, the Stockholders and the Escrow Agent, dated
as of May 19, 2020 (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, Novus, ORGA, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Novus (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Company have entered into a
business combination agreement and plan of reorganization (the " _BCA_ ";
terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed
to them in the BCA), which provides, among other things, that, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as
a wholly owned subsidiary of Novus.

  



  

WHEREAS, the Stockholders are entering into this Agreement as a condition of,
and as a material inducement for the Company to enter into and consummate
the transactions contemplated by the BCA, including the Closing of the
Merger.

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition of, and as a material inducement for the Company to
enter into and consummate the transactions contemplated by the BCA, Novus and
the Stockholders have entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement, dated as of
September 28, 2020 (the " _Support Agreement_ ") and are entering into a
Sponsor Lock-Up Agreement, dated on or about the date hereof (the " _Lock-Up
Agreement_ ").

  



  

1. _Share Restriction_. The Company, Novus and the Stockholders hereby agree that concurrently with the Closing, Novus shall instruct the Escrow Agent that the Escrow Shares shall be distributed to the Stockholders subject to potential forfeiture until vested in accordance with Section 3 and the further restrictions on transfer set forth in this Agreement the Support Agreement and the Lock-Up Agreement and cause the termination of the Escrow Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  



  

2. _Restricted Shares_.

  



  

2.1 Novus and each Stockholder agrees that, concurrently with the
release of the Escrow Shares, the Aggregate Number of Restricted Shares shall
be subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement (" _Restricted
Shares_ "). The number of Restricted Shares of each Stockholder shall be
determined on a pro rata basis, relative to the number of Escrow Shares owned
by each Stockholder immediately prior to the Closing, such that a number of
shares of Novus Common Stock held by each Stockholder equal to (i)
the product of the Aggregate Number of Restricted Shares and (ii) a fraction
equal to the aggregate number of Escrow Shares held by such Stockholder
immediately prior to the Closing, divided by 2,500,000 as set forth on
_Exhibit A_ hereto shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in this
Agreement. The Stockholders acknowledge that the Restricted Shares will be
legended to reflect the transfer restrictions applicable to the Restricted
Shares under this Agreement.

  



  

   

 



    



  

2.2 The aggregate number of Restricted Shares shall be calculated as
follows.

  



  

(a) Aggregate Number of Restricted Shares = the product of
1,250,000 and X.

  



  

(b) "X" is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing A and B.

  



  

(c) "A" is equal to the number, not less than -0-, of (i) shares
of Novus Common Stock (as adjusted for share splits, share
capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) redeemed
pursuant to the Redemption Rights, minus (ii) 1,025,000.

  



  

(d) "B" is equal to the number of shares Novus Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

2.3 _Legends_. The books and records of Novus evidencing the
Restricted Shares shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend (the "
_Legend_ ") in substantially the following form:

  



  

THE SECURITIES EVIDENCED HEREIN ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER, AND
CERTAIN OTHER AGREEMENTS, SET FORTH IN THE SPONSOR RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT,
DATED AS OF [__________________], 2020, THE LOCK-UP AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF
[__________________], 2020 AND THE SPONSOR SUPPORT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF
SEPTEMBER [●], 2020, BY AND AMONG NOVUS CAPITAL CORPORATION AND THE OTHER
PARTIES THERETO.

  



  

3. _Vesting of Restricted Shares_.

  



  

3.1 The Restricted Shares shall be subject to the transfer
restrictions set forth herein until satisfaction of the following trigger
events (each, a " _Triggering Event_ "):

  



  

(a) 50% of the Restricted Shares shall be released upon the date
on which (x) the closing price of the Novus Common Stock (as adjusted for
share splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and
the like) equals or exceeds $12.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a
30-trading day period commencing after the date of the closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing Date_ ") or (y) Novus consummates a sale, merger,
liquidation, exchange offer, transaction after the Merger (a "
_Subsequent Transaction_ ") which results in the stockholders of Novus having
the right to exchange their shares of Novus Common Stock for cash, securities
or other property having a value of at least $12.50 per share (for any noncash
proceeds, determined based on the valuation set forth in the definitive
agreements for such transaction or, in the absence of such valuation in good
faith by the board of directors of Novus), and

  



  

   

2.

 



    



  

(b) the remaining 50% of the Restricted Shares shall be released
upon the date on which (x) the closing price of the Novus Common Stock (as
adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations,
recapitalizations and the like) equals or exceeds $15.00 per share for any 20
trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing after the Closing Date
or (y) Novus consummates a Subsequent Transaction which results in the
stockholders of Novus having the right to exchange their shares of Novus
Common Stock for cash, securities or other property having a value of at
least $15.00 per share (for any noncash proceeds, determined based on the
valuation set forth in the definitive agreements for such transaction or, in
the absence of such valuation, in good faith by the board of directors of
Novus).

  



  

3.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Stockholders
hereby agree that in the event that none of the Trigger Events occur prior to
the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date (such period of time during
which the Restricted Shares are subject to the transfer restrictions set
forth herein, the " _Restricted Period_ "), the Restricted Shares shall be
forfeited to Novus and canceled and no Stockholder shall have any rights with
respect thereto.

  



  

3.3 As soon as practicable, and in any event within two (2) business
days after the occurrence of a Triggering Event with respect to the
applicable Restricted Shares as set forth in Section 3.1, Novus shall cause
any legend reflecting the limitation of transferability, the risk of
forfeiture and other restrictions under this Agreement to be removed from such
vested Restricted Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent then-
applicable, such shares will remain subject to the restrictions set forth in
the Lock-Up Agreement.

  



  

4. _Rights of Stockholders in the Restricted Shares_.

  



  

4.1 _Voting Rights as a Stockholder_. Subject to the terms of the
Support Agreement described in Section 3.1 hereof and except as
herein provided, the Stockholders shall retain all of their rights as
stockholders of Novus as long as any shares are held in escrow pursuant to
this Agreement, including, without limitation, the right to vote such shares.

  



  

4.2 _Dividends and Other Distributions in Respect of the Escrow
Shares_. For as long as any shares are Restricted Shares, all dividends
payable in cash with respect to such Restricted Shares shall be paid to the
Stockholders, but all dividends payable in stock or other non-cash property
(" _Non-Cash Dividends_ ") (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding stock or
other non-cash property issued pursuant to share splits, share
capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and similar transactions)
shall be set aside and not paid until the Restricted Shares have been vested
and released to the Stockholder or, if the Restricted Shares are not vested
and released in accordance with this Agreement, then all such distributions
declared on such Restricted Shares shall be forfeited. As used herein, the
term "Restricted Shares" shall be deemed to include the Non-Cash Dividends
distributed thereon, if any.

  



  

   

3.

 



    



  

4.3 _Restrictions on Transfer_. During the Restricted Period, each
Stockholder, severally and not jointly, agrees that it shall not sell,
assign, transfer (including by operation of law), pledge, dispose of, permit
to exist any material lien with respect to, or otherwise encumber any of the
Restricted Shares or otherwise agree to do any of the foregoing, except to
another stockholder of Novus that is a party to this Agreement and bound by
the terms and obligations hereof, deposit any Restricted Shares into a voting
trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement or grant any proxy or
power of attorney with respect thereto that is inconsistent with this
Agreement or enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or
undertaking with respect to the direct or indirect acquisition or
sale, assignment, transfer (including by operation of law) or other
disposition of any Restricted Shares, except to such other stockholder of
Novus that is a party to this Agreement and bound by the terms and obligations
hereof (including by executing a joinder agreeing to be bound by this
Agreement); provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit the transfer of
the Restricted Shares to (i) if Stockholder is an individual (A) to any
affiliate of such Stockholder, member of such Stockholder's immediate
family, or to a trust for the direct or indirect benefit of Stockholder or
any member of Stockholder's immediate family, the sole trustees of which are
such Stockholder or any member of such Stockholder's immediate family, (B) as
a bona fide gift to any charitable organization or (C) by will, other
testamentary document or under the laws of intestacy upon the death
of Stockholder; or (ii) if Stockholder is an entity, any equityholder,
partner, member, or affiliate of Stockholder, or any investment fund or other
entity controlling, controlled by, managed by or under common control with the
Stockholder or affiliates of the Stockholder, but only if, in the case of
clause (i) and (ii), such transferee shall execute this Agreement or a joinder
agreeing to become a party to this Agreement.

  



  

5. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

5.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated.

construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable

arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Chancery Court. The parties hereto hereby (i)
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party hereto, and (ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way
of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is

property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or
that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder may not be
enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.

  



  

5.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the BCA, the
Sponsor Support Agreement and the Lock-Up Agreement, contains the
entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof. Any term of this Agreement may be amended, modified or terminated and

5.

 



    



  

The parties may change the persons and addresses to which the notices or
other communications are to be sent by giving written notice to any such
change in the manner provided herein for giving notice.

  



  

5.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

5.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each one of which shall constitute an original and may be
delivered by facsimile transmission and together shall constitute one
instrument.

  



  

5.9 _Parties in Interest_. Except as set forth below, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto (and Novus' permitted assigns), and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. No Stockholder shall be liable for the breach by any other
Stockholder of this Agreement. The covenants and obligations of each
Stockholder set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as independent of
any other contract between such Stockholder, on the one hand, and the Company
or Novus, on the other hand. The existence of any claim or cause of action by
any such Stockholder against the Company or Novus shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement of any of such covenants or obligations against
such Stockholder. Except as otherwise provided herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit any of the rights or remedies of Novus or the Company
under the BCA, or any of the rights or remedies of Novus or the Company or
any of the obligations such Stockholder under any agreement between such
Stockholder and the Company or any certificate or instrument executed by such
Stockholder in favor of Novus or the Company; and nothing in the BCA or in
any other such agreement, certificate or instrument, shall limit any of the
rights or remedies of the Company or any of the obligations of such
Stockholder under this Agreement.

  



  

5.10 _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed
in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at
law or in equity without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy and without bond or other security being required, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the parties hereto hereby further acknowledges that the
existence of any other remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not
diminish the availability of specific performance of the obligations hereunder
or any other injunctive relief. Each party hereto hereby further agrees that
in the event of any action by any other party for specific performance or
injunctive relief, it will not assert that a remedy at law or other remedy
would be adequate or that specific performance or injunctive relief in
respect of such breach or violation should not be available on the grounds
that money damages are adequate or any other grounds.

  



  

   

6.

 



    



  

5.11 _Further Assurances_. At the request of Novus or the Company, in
the case of any Stockholder, at the request of Novus, in the case of the
Company, or at the request of the Company, in the case of Novus, and without
further consideration, each party shall execute and deliver or cause to be
executed and delivered such additional documents and instruments and take such
further action as may be reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

5.12 _Effectiveness_. This Agreement shall not be effective or
binding upon any Stockholder until such time as the BCA is executed and
delivered by the Company, Novus and Merger Sub.

  



  

5.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, as applicable,
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
5.13.

  



  

5.14 Stockholder Obligations. Each Stockholder signs this Agreement
solely in Stockholder's capacity as a holder of Shares of Novus, and not in
Stockholder's capacity as a director, officer or employee of Novus or in
Stockholder's capacity as a trustee or fiduciary of any employee benefit plan
or trust.

  



  

5.15 _Interpretation_. The words "hereof," "herein," "hereinafter,"
"hereunder," and "hereto" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular section or subsection of this
Agreement and reference to a particular section of this Agreement will

and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought
before the meeting. Participation of one or more Stockholders by conference
telephone allowing all persons participating in the meeting to hear

such purpose. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law or
by these by-laws (" _By-Laws_ "). Any meeting may be held without notice if

notice is waived in writing, either before or after the meeting, by those not
present. In every notice of a meeting of stockholders, the corporation shall
include a statement to the effect that the corporation is a public benefit
corporation formed pursuant to Subchapter XV of Chapter 1 of Title 8 of the

of Incorporation, or these By-Laws, all other action shall be determined by a
majority of the votes cast at such meeting. Each proxy to vote shall be in
writing and signed by the Stockholder or by such Stockholder's duly
authorized attorney.

  



  

   



 



    



  

At all elections of directors, the voting shall be by ballot or in such other
manner as may be determined by the Stockholders present in person or by proxy
entitled to vote at such election. With respect to any other matter presented
to the Stockholders for their consideration at a meeting, any Stockholder
entitled to vote may, on any question, demand a vote by ballot.

arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of each, and the number of
shares registered in the name of each Stockholder, shall be prepared by the
Secretary and shall be open to the examination of any Stockholder, for any
purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period
of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the
city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the
notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the
meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time
and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected
by any Stockholder who is present.

  



  

Section 7\. _Inspectors of Election_. The Board of Directors in advance of
any meeting of Stockholders may appoint one or more inspectors of election ("
_Inspectors of Elections_ ") to act at the meeting or any adjournment
thereof. If Inspectors of Election are not so appointed, the chairman of the
meeting may, and on the request of any Stockholder entitled to vote shall,
appoint one or more Inspectors of Election. Each Inspector of
Election, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and
sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of an Inspector of Election at
such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. If appointed, Inspectors of Election shall take charge of the polls
and, when the vote is completed, shall make a certificate of the result of the
vote taken and of such other facts as may be required by law.

  



  

Section 8\. _Action by Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of Stockholders, including the annual meeting, may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if, prior to such
action, a written consent or consents thereto, setting forth such action,
is signed by the holders of record of shares of the stock of the Corporation,
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted.

A majority of the members of the Board of Directors (or any committee
thereof) (unless the number of directors then in office shall be one, in which
case one director) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business;
provided, that if at any meeting of the Board of Directors there shall be less
than a quorum present, a majority of those present may adjourn the meeting
from time to time until a quorum shall have been obtained. Except as
otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws,
the vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a
quorum is present shall constitute the act of the Board of Directors.

displaced.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Whenever any vacancy shall have occurred in the Board of Directors, by reason
of death, resignation, or otherwise, other than removal of a director with or
without cause by a vote of the Stockholders, it shall be filled by a majority
vote of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum (except as
otherwise provided by applicable law), or by the Stockholders, and the person
so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until a
successor is duly elected and has qualified.

  



  

Any one or more of the directors of the Corporation may be removed either
with or without cause at any time by a vote of the holders of record of at
least a majority of the shares of stock of the Corporation, issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote, and thereupon the term of the director or

vote of the Stockholders as provided in these By-Laws.

if all directors are present, or if notice is waived in writing, either before

directors by conference telephone allowing all persons participating in the

resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, designate
from among its members one or more committees which shall consist of one or
more directors. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as
alternate members of any such committee, who may replace any absent or
disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. Such committees shall
have and may exercise such powers as shall be conferred or authorized by the
resolution appointing them. A majority of any such committee may determine
its action and fix the time and place of its meetings, unless the Board of
Directors shall otherwise provide. The Board of Directors shall have power at
any time to change the membership of any such committee, to fill vacancies in
it, or to dissolve it.

  



  

Section 4\. _Action by Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be
taken without a meeting, if prior to such action a written consent or
consents thereto is signed by all members of the Board of Directors, or of
such committee as the case may be, and such written consent or consents is
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee,
as applicable.

ARTICLE IV

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

Section 1\. _Directors and Officers_. The Corporation shall indemnify its
directors and officers to the fullest extent not prohibited by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (" _DGCL_ ") or any other applicable
law; provided, however, that the Corporation may modify the extent of such
indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and officers; and,
provided, further, that the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify
any director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly
required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided
by the Corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in
the Corporation under the DGCL or any other applicable law or (iv) such
indemnification is required to be made under Section 4 of this Article IV.

  



  

Section 2\. _Employees and other Agents_. The Corporation shall have power to
indemnify its employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other
applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the
determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person as
the Board of Directors shall determine.

  



  

Section 3\. _Expenses_. The Corporation shall advance to any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a
director or officer, of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final
disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all
expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with such
proceeding, provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of
expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of
an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article IV or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise
determined pursuant to Section 5 of this Article IV, no advance shall be made
by the Corporation to an officer of the Corporation (except by reason of the
fact that such officer is or was a director of the Corporation in which event
this sentence shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is
reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not
parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of
such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even though
less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or such
directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that
the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination
is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad
faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed
to the best interests of the Corporation.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 4\. _Enforcement_. Without the necessity of entering into an express
contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and officers
under this Article IV shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be
effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the
Corporation and the director or officer. Any right to indemnification or
advances granted by this Article IV to a director or officer shall be
enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of
competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is
denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made
within ninety (90) days of request therefor. To the extent permitted by law,
the claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part,
shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In
connection with any claim for indemnification, the Corporation shall be
entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not
met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any
other applicable law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the
amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an officer of the Corporation
(except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such officer is or
was a director of the Corporation) for advances, the Corporation shall be
entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing
evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person
did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such
person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
lawful. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of
the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an
actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. In any suit brought by a director or officer to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of
proving that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to
such advancement of expenses, under this Article IV or otherwise shall be on
the Corporation.

  



  

Section 5\. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person
by this Article IV shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.
The Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts
with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL
or any other applicable law.

  



  

Section 6\. _Survival of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by this
Article IV shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such a person.

  



  

Section 7\. _Insurance_. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any
other applicable law, the Corporation, upon approval by the Board of
Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this Article IV.

  



  

Section 8\. _Amendments_. Any repeal or modification of this Article IV shall
only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Article IV in
effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act
that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 9\. _Saving Clause_.

  



  

If this Article IV or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground
by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify each director and officer to the full extent not
prohibited by any applicable portion of this Article IV that shall not have
been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this Article IV shall be
invalid due to the application of the indemnification provisions of another
jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall indemnify each director and executive
officer to the full extent under any other applicable law.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Section 10\. _Certain Definitions_.

  



  

For the purposes of this Article IV, the following definitions shall apply:

  



  

(1) The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall include,
without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense,
settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative.

  



  

(2) The term "expenses" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without
limitation, court costs, attorneys' fees, witness fees, fines, amounts paid in
settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses of any nature or kind
incurred in connection with any proceeding.

  



  

(3) The term the "corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation,
or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position
under the provisions of this Article IV with respect to the resulting or
surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent
corporation if its separate existence had continued.

  



  

(4) References to a "director," "executive officer," "officer," "employee,"
or "agent" of the corporation shall include, without limitation, situations
where such person is serving at the request of the corporation as,
respectively, a director, executive officer, officer, employee, trustee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise.

  



  

(5) References to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans;
references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with
respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the
request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation" as referred to in this section.

in such manner, if any, as the Board of Directors may by resolution prescribe.
Where any such certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent other than
the Corporation or its employee, or registered by a registrar other than the
Corporation or its employee, the signature of any such officer may be a
facsimile signature. In case any officer or officers who shall have
signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on,
any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or
officers of the Corporation, whether because of death, resignation or
otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been delivered
by the Corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be
adopted by the Corporation and be issued and delivered as though the person
or persons who signed such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile
signature or signatures shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be
such officer or officers of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 2\. _Transfer_. The shares of stock of the Corporation shall be

transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, with such proof
of the authenticity of the signature as the Corporation or its agents may
reasonably require.

date for the distribution or allotment of any rights, or the date when
any change, conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect, as
a record date for the determination of the Stockholders entitled to notice
of, and to vote at, any such meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any
such dividend, or to receive any distribution or allotment of such rights, or
to exercise the rights in respect of any such change, conversion or exchange
of capital stock, and in such case only such Stockholders as shall be
Stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be entitled to such notice
of, and to vote at, such meeting, or to receive payment of such dividend, or
to receive such distribution or allotment or rights or to exercise such
rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the
books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed as aforesaid.

  



  

Section 4\. _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any certificate of stock
is lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated, the Board of Directors may authorize
the issuance of a new certificate of the same tenor and for the same number
of shares in lieu thereof. The Board of Directors may in its discretion,
before the issuance of such new certificate, require the owner of the lost,
stolen, destroyed or mutilated certificate, or the legal representative of
the owner to make an affidavit or affirmation setting forth such facts as to
the loss, destruction or mutilation as it deems necessary, and to give the
Corporation a bond in such reasonable sum as it directs to indemnify the
Corporation.

Stock.

VI.

  



  

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the
Company, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of
the Company, of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof,
as the case may be, it is further provided that:

  



  

A. Board of Directors.

  



  

1. Generally. The management of the business and the conduct of the affairs of the Company shall be vested in the Board of Directors. The authorized number of directors which shall constitute the Board of Directors shall be fixed by the Board of Directors in the manner provided in the Bylaws.

  



  

2. Election.

  



  

(a) Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock to elect additional directors as specified in any Preferred
Stock Designation, all directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of
stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. The directors of
the Company need not be elected by written ballot unless the Bylaws so
provide.

  



  

(b) No stockholder entitled to vote at an election for directors
may cumulate votes to which such stockholder is entitled unless required by
applicable law at the time of such election. During such time or times that
applicable law requires cumulative voting, every stockholder entitled to vote
at an election for directors may cumulate such stockholder's votes and give
one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be
elected multiplied by the number of votes to which such stockholder's shares
are otherwise entitled, or distribute the stockholder's votes on the same
principle among as many candidates as such stockholder thinks fit. No
stockholder, however, shall be entitled to so cumulate such stockholder's
votes unless (i) the names of such candidate or candidates have been placed
in nomination prior to the voting and (ii) the stockholder has given notice
at the meeting, prior to the voting, of such stockholder's intention to
cumulate such stockholder's votes. If any stockholder has given proper notice
to cumulate votes, all stockholders may cumulate their votes for any
candidates who have been properly placed in nomination. Under cumulative
voting, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up to the
number of directors to be elected, are elected.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, each
director shall serve until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified
or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the
number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the
term of any incumbent director.

  



  

3. Removal of Directors. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law, removal shall be as provided in Section 141(k) of the DGCL.

  



  

4. Vacancies. Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall, unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly created directorships shall be filled by the stockholders and except as otherwise provided by applicable law, be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or occurred and until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified.

  



  

   



 



    



  

B. Stockholder Actions. No action shall be taken by the
stockholders of the Company except at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders called in accordance with the Bylaws, and no action shall be
taken by the stockholders by written consent. Advance notice of
stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of business to be
brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Company
shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws.

  



  

C. Bylaws. The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt,
amend or repeal the Bylaws. The stockholders shall also have the power to
adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in addition
to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Company
required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, such action by
stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of the
capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class.

  



  

VII.

  



  

A. The Company reserves the right to amend, alter, change or
repeal any provision contained in the Certificate of Incorporation, in
the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the DGCL, except as provided in
paragraph B. of this Article VII, and all rights conferred upon the
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

  



  

B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser
vote or no vote, but in addition to any affirmative vote of the holders of
any particular class or series of the Company required by law or by the
Certificate of Incorporation or any Preferred Stock Designation filed with
respect to a series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to alter,
amend or repeal Articles V, VI, VII and VIII.

  



  

VIII.

  



  

At any time when any shares of capital stock of the Company are outstanding,
the Company shall not, either directly or indirectly, merge or
consolidate with or into another entity if, as a result of such merger or
consolidation, the capital stock of the Company would become, or be converted
into or exchanged for the right to receive, shares or other equity interests
in a domestic or foreign corporation that is not a public benefit corporation
or similar entity and the certificate of incorporation (or similar governing
document) of which does not contain identical provisions to Article III
identifying the public benefit or public benefits, unless the Company shall
have obtained, in addition to any affirmative vote required by law or by the
Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
voting together as a single class.

said corporation in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL. This Second
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted in

regulations promulgated thereunder (including such person's written consent to

Proponent individually, or to the Proponents in the aggregate) in such

period for which nominations would otherwise be due under Section 5(b)(iii)
and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming the nominees
for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the

otherwise required by law, the chairperson of the annual meeting shall have
the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed
to be brought before the meeting was made, or proposed, as the case may be,
in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if
any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws,
or the Proponent does not act in accordance with the representations in
Sections 5(b)(iv)(D) and 5(b)(iv)(E), to declare that such proposal or
nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and
shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such
nomination or such business may have been solicited or received.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, in
order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in
the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholders' meeting, a
stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934 Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be
deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals
in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934
Act; _provided, however,_ that any references in these Bylaws to the 1934 Act
or the rules and regulations thereunder are not intended to and shall not
limit the requirements applicable to proposals and/or nominations to be
considered pursuant to Section 5(a).

position, note, bond, convertible security, swap, stock appreciation right,

Section 6. Special Meetings.

called, for any purpose as is a proper matter for stockholder action
under Delaware law, by (i) the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, (ii)
the Chief Executive Officer, or (iii) the Board of Directors pursuant to a
resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.

  



  

(b) For a special meeting called pursuant to Section 6(a), the
person(s) calling the meeting shall determine the time and place, if any, of
the meeting; provided, however, that only the Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof may authorize a meeting solely by means of
remote communication. Upon determination of the date, time and place, if any,
of the meeting, the Secretary shall cause a notice of meeting to be given to
the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions
of Section 7\. No business may be transacted at a special meeting otherwise
than as specified in the notice of meeting.

  



  

(c) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors
may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to
be elected (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof or (ii) by any stockholder of the corporation
who is a stockholder of record or beneficial owner at the time of giving
notice provided for in this paragraph, who is entitled to vote at the meeting
and who delivers written notice to the Secretary of the corporation setting
forth the information required by Section 5(b)(i) and the information
required by Section 5(b)(iv). In the event the corporation calls a special
meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to
the Board of Directors, any such stockholder of record or beneficial owner
may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such
position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if written
notice setting forth the information required by Section 5(b)(i) and the
information required by Section 5(b)(iv) shall be received by the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close
of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such meeting or
the tenth (10th) day following the day on which the corporation first makes a
public announcement of the date of the special meeting at which directors are
to be elected. The stockholder shall also update and supplement such
information as required under Section 5(c). In no event shall an adjournment
or a postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, or the
public announcement thereof has been made, commence a new time period (or
extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described
above.

  



  

(d) A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as
a director at the special meeting unless the person is nominated either in
accordance with clause (i) or clause (ii) of Section 6(c). Except as otherwise
required by law, the chairperson of the special meeting shall have the power
and duty to determine whether a nomination was made in accordance with the
procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any nomination or business is
not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such nomination shall
not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be
disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such nomination may
have been solicited or received.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, a
stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of the 1934
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set
forth in this Section 6\. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect
any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the
corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act;
_provided, however,_ that any references in these Bylaws to the 1934 Act
or the rules and regulations thereunder are not intended to and shall not
limit the requirements applicable to nominations for the election to the
Board of Directors or proposals of other businesses to be considered pursuant
to Section 6(c).

  



  

Section 7. Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law,
notice, given in writing or by electronic transmission, of each meeting
of stockholders shall be given not fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty
(60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote
at such meeting, such notice to specify the place, if any, date and hour, in
the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes of the meeting, the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which
stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and
vote at any such meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such
stockholder's mailing address as it appears on the records of the corporation.
If delivered by courier service, notice is given at the earlier of when the
notice is received or left at such stockholder's address as it appears on the
records of the corporation. If sent via electronic transmission, notice is
given when directed to such stockholder's electronic mail address as it
appears on the records of the corporation unless the stockholder has notified
the corporation in writing or by electronic transmission of an objection to
receiving notice by electronic mail or such notice is prohibited by Section
232(e) of the DGCL. Notice of the time, place, if any, and purpose of any
meeting of stockholders (to the extent required) may be waived in writing,
signed by the person entitled to notice thereof or by electronic transmission
by such person, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by
any stockholder by his or her attendance thereat in person, by remote
communication, if applicable, or by proxy, except when the stockholder
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of
the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such
meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects
as if due notice thereof had been given.

  



  

Section 8. Quorum; Voting. At all meetings of stockholders, except where
otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by
these Bylaws, the presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable,
or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the voting power
of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the absence of a
quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time,
either by the chairperson of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the shares represented thereat and entitled
to vote thereon, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting.
The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a
quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a
quorum. Except as otherwise provided by statute or by applicable stock
exchange rules, or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, in
all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person, by
remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized
at the meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter shall be
the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes of the shares present in person, by remote
communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the
meeting and entitled to vote generally on the election of directors. Where a
separate vote by a class or classes or series is required, except where
otherwise provided by statute, by applicable stock exchange rules or by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a majority of the voting power
of the outstanding shares of such class or classes or series, present in
person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly
authorized, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to
that vote on that matter. Except where otherwise provided by statute, by
applicable stock exchange rules or by the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority (plurality, in
the case of the election of directors) of voting power of such class or
classes or series present in person, by remote communication, if applicable,
or represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or
classes or series.

Section 9. Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings. Any meeting of
stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to
time either by the person(s) who called the meeting or the chairperson of the
meeting, or by the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of
the shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or
represented by proxy duly authorized at the meeting and entitled to vote
thereon. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, if any, notice
need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, and
means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and
proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business
that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after
the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled
to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix
as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give
notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record
date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

  



  

Section 10. Voting Rights. For the purpose of determining those
stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, except as
otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the
stock records of the corporation on the record date shall be entitled to vote
at any meeting of stockholders. Every person entitled to vote shall have the
right to do so either in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or
by an agent or agents authorized by a proxy granted in accordance with
Delaware law. An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall
be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date of creation unless
the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it
states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with
an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder
may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and
voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the corporation a
revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Voting at
meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot.

  



  

Section 11. Joint Owners of Stock. If shares or other securities having
voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether
fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common,
tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the
same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary
is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the
instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it
is so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following
effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his or her act binds all; (b) if more than
one (1) votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; and (c) if
more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular
matter, each faction may vote the securities in question proportionally, or
any person voting the shares, or a beneficiary, may apply to the Delaware
Court of Chancery for relief as provided in DGCL Section 217(b). If the
instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in
unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c)
shall be a majority or even-split in interest.

Section 12. List of Stockholders. The corporation shall prepare, at
least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of
the stockholders of record entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number
and class of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list
shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane
to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting,
(a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice
of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place
of business of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines
to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the corporation. The list shall be open to examination of any
stockholder during the time of the meeting as provided by law.

  



  

Section 13. Action without Meeting. Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, no action shall be taken by the stockholders of
the corporation except at an annual or a special meeting of the stockholders
called in accordance with these Bylaws, and no action of the stockholders of
the corporation may be taken by the stockholders by written consent or
electronic transmission.

  



  

Section 14. Organization.

  



  

(a) At every meeting of stockholders, the Chairperson of the Board
of Directors, or, if a chairperson has not been appointed, is absent or
refuses to act, the Chief Executive Officer, or, if no Chief Executive Officer
is then serving, is absent or refuses to act, the President, or, if the
President is absent or refuses to act, a chairperson of the meeting designated
by the Board of Directors, or, if the Board of Directors does not designate
such chairperson, a chairperson chosen by a majority of the voting power of
the stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy duly
authorized, shall act as chairperson. The Chairperson of the Board may
appoint the Chief Executive Officer as chairperson of the meeting. The
Secretary, or, in his or her absence, an Assistant Secretary or other
officer, director or other person directed to do so by the chairperson of the
meeting, shall act as secretary of the meeting.

  



  

(b) The Board of Directors of the corporation shall be entitled to
make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as
it shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and
regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the chairperson of the meeting
shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to
recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and
procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such
chairperson, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper conduct
of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda or
order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining order
at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on participation
in such meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation and their duly
authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as the chairperson
shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for
the commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to questions or
comments by participants and regulation of the opening and closing of the
polls for balloting on matters which are to be voted on by ballot. The date
and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which
the stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the
meeting. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the
chairperson of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to
be held in accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure.

  



  

(c) The corporation shall, in advance of any meeting of
stockholders, appoint one (1) or more inspectors to act at the meeting
and make a written report thereof. The corporation may designate one (1) or
more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to
act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders,
the chairperson of the meeting shall appoint one (1) or more inspectors to
act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of
the duties of inspector, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute
the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of
such inspector's ability. The inspectors shall: (1) ascertain the number of
shares outstanding and the voting power of each; (2) determine the shares
represented at a meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots; (3) count
all votes and ballots; (4) determine and retain for a reasonable period a
record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the
inspectors; and (5) certify their determination of the number of shares
represented at the meeting, and their count of all votes and ballots.
The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the
inspectors in the performance of the duties of the inspectors. In determining
the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the inspectors shall be
limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted with those
proxies, any information provided in accordance with Sections 211(e)
or 212(c)(2) of the DGCL, or any information provided pursuant to Sections
211(a)(2)b.(i) or (iii) of the DGCL, ballots and the regular books and
records of the corporation, except that the inspectors may consider
other reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and
ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or
similar persons which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is
authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the stockholder
holds of record. If the inspectors consider other reliable information for the
limited purpose permitted herein, the inspectors at the time they make their
certification pursuant to Section 231(b)(5) of the DGCL shall specify the
precise information considered by them including the person or persons from
whom they obtained the information, when the information was obtained, the
means by which the information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors'
belief that such information is accurate and reliable.

matter (other than the election or removal of directors) expressly required
by the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval, or (ii) adopting,
amending or repealing any Bylaw of the corporation.

provide, regular meetings of the Executive Committee or any other committee
appointed pursuant to this Section 25 shall be held at such times and places,
if any, as are determined by the Board of Directors, or by any such
committee, and when notice thereof has been given to each member of such

convened. Unless otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in the
resolutions authorizing the creation of the committee, a majority of the
authorized number of members of any such committee shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of those members
of the committee present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be
the act of such committee.

law or these Bylaws, and such execution or signature shall be binding upon the

Section 35. Form and Execution of Certificates. The shares of the

if so provided by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors.
Certificates, if any, for the shares of stock shall be in such form as is
consistent with the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable law.
Certificates of shares of stock shall note conspicuously that the corporation
is a public benefit corporation formed pursuant to Subchapter XV of the DGCL.
Every holder of stock in the corporation represented by certificate shall be
entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of, the corporation
by any two (2) authorized officers of the corporation, certifying the number
of shares owned by such holder in the corporation. Any or all of the
signatures on the certificate may be facsimiles. In case any officer, transfer
agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been
placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer
agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued with
the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent,
or registrar at the date of issue. Any notice given by the corporation
pursuant to Section 151(f) of the DGCL upon the issuance or transfer of
uncertificated shares shall state conspicuously that the corporation is a
public benefit corporation formed pursuant to Subchapter XV of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 36. Lost Certificates. A new certificate or certificates shall
be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by
the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of

condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, the
owner of such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or certificates, or
the owner's legal representative, to agree to indemnify the corporation in
such manner as it shall require or to give the corporation a surety bond in
such form and amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to
have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.

   | Section 38.| Fixing Record Dates.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall, subject to applicable
law, not be more than sixty (60) nor fewer than ten (10) days before the date
of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall
also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
such meeting unless the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes
such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall
be the date for making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting;  _provided, however,_ that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled
to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the
record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the
same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

  



  

(b) In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in
advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date
shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record
date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

Section 39. Registered Stockholders. The corporation shall be
entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books
as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest
in such share or shares on the part of any other person whether or not it
shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by
the laws of Delaware.

OTHER SECURITIES OF THE CORPORATION

and other corporate securities of the corporation, other than stock
certificates (covered in Section 35), may be signed by any executive officer
(as defined in Article XI) or any other officer or person as may be
authorized by the Board of Directors; _provided, however,_ that where any such
bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be authenticated by the
manual signature, or where permissible facsimile signature, of a trustee under
an indenture pursuant to which such bond, debenture or other corporate
security shall be issued, the signatures of the persons signing and
attesting the corporate seal on such bond, debenture or other corporate
security may be the imprinted facsimile of the signatures of such persons.
Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or other corporate
security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by an
executive officer of the corporation or such other officer or person as may be
authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile
signature of such person. In case any officer who shall have signed or
attested any bond, debenture or other corporate security, or whose facsimile
signature shall appear thereon or on any such interest coupon, shall have
ceased to be such officer before the bond, debenture or other corporate
security so signed or attested shall have been delivered, such bond,
debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be adopted by the
corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who signed the same
or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be
such officer of the corporation.

its absolute discretion, thinks proper as a reserve or reserves to meet
contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining
any property of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board of
Directors shall think conducive to the interests of the corporation, and the

Article XI

  



  

INDEMNIFICATION

  



   | Section 44.| Indemnification of Directors, Executive
Officers, Employees and Other Agents.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) Directors and Executive Officers. The corporation shall
indemnify its directors and executive officers (for the purposes of this
Article XI,  " _executive officers_ " shall have the meaning defined in Rule
3b-7 promulgated under the 1934 Act) to the fullest extent permitted by the
DGCL or any other applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be
amended, who were or are made a party or are threatened to be made a party or
are otherwise involved in proceeding, by reason of the fact that he or she,
or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a
director or officer of the corporation, against all liability and loss
suffered and expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by such
person; _provided, however,_ that the corporation may modify the extent of
such indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and executive
officers, in which case such contract shall supersede and replace the
provisions hereof; and, _provided, further,_  that the corporation shall not
be required to indemnify any director or executive officer in connection with
any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such
indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding
was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation, (iii) such
indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion,
pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the DGCL or any other
applicable law or (iv) such indemnification is required to be made under
subsection (d) of this Section 44.

  



  

   



 



    



  

(b) Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents. The corporation
shall have the power to indemnify (including the power to advance expenses in
a manner consistent with subsection (c) of this Section 44) its other
officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL or any other
applicable law. The Board of Directors shall have the power to delegate the
determination of whether indemnification shall be given to any such person
except executive officers to such officers or other persons as the Board of
Directors shall determine.

  



  

(c) Expenses. The corporation shall advance to any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director or executive officer of the corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the corporation as a director or executive officer of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request
therefor, all expenses incurred by any director or executive officer in
connection with such proceeding; _provided, however_ , that if the DGCL
requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a director or executive
officer in his or her capacity as a director or executive officer (and not in
any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an
" _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts
so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision
from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a " _final
adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for
such expenses under this section or otherwise.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to
paragraph (d) of this Section 44, no advance shall be made by the corporation
to an executive officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that
such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation in which event
this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is
reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of directors who were not
parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of
such directors designated by a majority vote of such directors, even
though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or such
directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that
the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is
made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith
or in a manner that such person did not reasonably believe to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.

  



  

(d) Enforcement. Without the necessity of entering into an express
contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and
executive officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights
and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract
between the corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to
indemnification or advances granted by this section to a director or
executive officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding
such right in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware if (i) the claim
for indemnification or advances is denied by the Board of Directors, in whole
or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made within ninety (90)
days of request therefor. To the extent permitted by law, the claimant in
such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled
to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim to the fullest extent
permitted by law. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the
corporation shall be entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that
the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible
under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify
the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an
executive officer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of
the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a
defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that such person
acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not reasonably believe
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without
reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was lawful. Neither the
failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an
actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. In any suit brought by a director or executive officer to enforce a
right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the
burden of proving that the director or executive officer is not entitled to
be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this section or
otherwise shall be on the corporation.

  



  

   



 



    



  

(e) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by
this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The
corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with
any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the
DGCL, or by any other applicable law.

  



  

(f) Survival of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this
Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director
or executive officer or officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to
the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

  



  

(g) Insurance. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any
other applicable law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of
Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or
permitted to be indemnified pursuant to this section.

  



  

(h) Amendments. Any amendment, repeal or modification of this
section shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under
this Bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the
corporation.

  



  

(i) Saving Clause. If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer
to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this section
that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this
section shall be invalid due to the application of the indemnification
provisions of another jurisdiction, then the corporation shall indemnify each
director and executive officer to the full extent under any other applicable
law.

  



  

   



 



    



  

(j) Certain Definitions. For the purposes of this Bylaw, the
following definitions shall apply:

  



  

(i) The term " _proceeding_ " shall be broadly construed and shall
include, without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution,
defense, settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony
in, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative.

  



  

(ii) The term " _expenses_ " shall be broadly construed and shall
include, without limitation, court costs, attorneys' fees, witness fees,
fines, amounts paid in settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses
of any nature or kind incurred in connection with any proceeding.

  



  

(iii) The term the " _corporation_ " shall include, in addition to the
resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent
of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is
or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
stand in the same position under the provisions of this section with respect
to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with
respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

  



  

(iv) References to a " _director_ ," " _executive officer_ ," "

NOTICES

  



   | Section 45.| Notices.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) Notice to Stockholders. Notice to stockholders of stockholder
meetings shall be given as provided in Section 7 herein. Without limiting the
manner by which notice may otherwise be given effectively to stockholders,
including under any agreement or contract with such stockholder, subject to
Section 232(e) of the DGCL, any notice to stockholders given by the
corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation
or the Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic
transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any
such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice or
electronic transmission to the corporation. Notice shall be deemed given
pursuant to this Section 45, (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when
directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
(2) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to
the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (a) such posting,
and (b) the giving of such separate notice; and (3) if by any other form of
electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. For purposes of
these Bylaws, (1) " _Electronic transmission_ " means any form of
communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
including the use of, or participation in, one or more electronic networks or
databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or
databases), that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed
by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by
such a recipient through an automated process; (2) " _Electronic mail_ "
means an electronic transmission directed to a unique electronic mail address
(which electronic mail shall be deemed to include any files attached thereto
and any information hyperlinked to a website if such electronic mail includes
the contact information of an officer or agent of the corporation who is
available to assist with accessing such files and information); and (3) "
_Electronic mail address_ " means a destination, commonly expressed as a
string of characters, consisting of a unique user name or mailbox (commonly
referred to as the "local part" of the address) and a reference to an
internet domain (commonly referred to as the "domain part" of the address),
whether or not displayed, to which electronic mail can be sent or delivered.

  



  

(b) Notice to Directors. Any notice required to be given to any
director may be given by the method stated in subsection (a) or as otherwise
provided in these Bylaws, with notice other than one which is delivered
personally to be sent to such address as such director shall have filed in
writing with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last
known address of such director.

  



  

(c) Affidavit of Mailing. An affidavit of mailing, executed by a
duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or its
transfer agent appointed with respect to the class of stock affected or other
agent, specifying the name and address or the names and addresses of the
stockholder or stockholders, or director or directors, to whom any such notice
or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same,
shall in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts therein
contained.

  



  

(d) Methods of Notice. It shall not be necessary that the same
method of giving notice be employed in respect of all recipients of
notice, but one permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or
more, and any other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect
of any other or others.

  



  

(e) Notice to Person with Whom Communication is Unlawful. Whenever
notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of
the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, to any person with whom
communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not
be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority
or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any
action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such
person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and
effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action
taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate
under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the
fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled
to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.

  



  

(f) Notice to Stockholders Sharing an Address. Except as otherwise
prohibited under the DGCL, any notice given under the provisions of the DGCL,
the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws shall be effective if given by
a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to
by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Such consent
shall have been deemed to have been given if such stockholder fails to object
in writing to the corporation within sixty (60) days of having been given
notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice. Any
consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the
corporation.

  



  

   



 



    



  

Article XIII

  



  

AMENDMENTS

  



  

Section 46. Amendments. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 44(h) of these Bylaws or the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors is expressly empowered to adopt, amend
or repeal the Bylaws. Any adoption, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws by the
Board of Directors shall require the approval of a majority of the authorized
number of directors. The stockholders also shall have power to adopt, amend
or repeal the Bylaws; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the
holders of any class or series of stock of the corporation required by law or
by the Certificate of Incorporation, such action by stockholders
shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and
two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

  



  

Article XIV

  



  

LOANS TO OFFICERS

  



  

Section 47. Loans to Officers. Except as otherwise prohibited by
applicable law, the corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any
obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the
corporation or of its subsidiaries, including any officer or employee who is
a director of the corporation or its subsidiaries, whenever, in the judgment
of the Board of Directors, such loan, guarantee or assistance may reasonably
be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guarantee or other
assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured
in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without
limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in these
Bylaws shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or
warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.

  



  

ARTICLE XV

  



  

BOOKS AND RECORDS

  



  

Section 48. The books and records of the corporation may be kept
within or outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may from
time to time be designated by the Board of Directors. Any books or records
maintained by the corporation in the regular course of its business,
including its stock ledger, books of account, and minute books, may be kept
on, or by means of, or be in the form of, any information storage device or
method; provided, however, that the books and records so kept can be converted
into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time. The corporation
shall so convert any books or records so kept upon the request of any
person entitled to inspect such records pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation, these Bylaws or the DGCL.
