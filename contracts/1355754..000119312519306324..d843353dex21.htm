the probable liabilities of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on their existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b)&nbsp;each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
will not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged; and (c)&nbsp;each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be able to pay its liabilities,

entered into this Agreement. It is explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parent&#146;s and Merger Sub&#146;s obligations to consummate
the Merger and cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to enforce the obligations of the Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in

Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing, and in no event shall the Company, any of its Affiliates or its or their direct or indirect equityholders be entitled to directly

security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. </P>
