DGCL.  SECTION 2.2 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.  SECTION 2.3

(the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 140

Contemporaneously with or as promptly as practicable after the Closing,
Parent and the Company shall cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware a properly executed certificate of merger conforming to
the requirements of the DGCL and in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A,
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the
"Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become effective when
the Certificate of Merger is accepted for recording by the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware (the "Effective Time").  SECTION 2.5 Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.  (a) At the Effective
Time and without any further action on the part of the  Company or Merger
Sub, the Company Certificate of Incorporation shall be  amended to read in
its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger  Sub reads as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until  thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,  provided, that such
certificate of incorporation shall reflect as of the  Effective Time "Hanna
Andersson Corporation" as the name of the Surviving  Corporation. The Bylaws
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the  Effective Time, shall
be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until  thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by the Certificate of  Incorporation and
applicable Law.  (b) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be  the directors of the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time, until  the earlier of their resignation or removal or
otherwise ceasing to be a  director or until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified,  as the case may be.  (c) The officers of the
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall  be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, until  the earlier of
their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an  officer or until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,  as the case may
be.  SECTION 2.6 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of Company Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:  (a)
Each share of Company Capital Stock that is held in the treasury of the 
Company and each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub 
or any other wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired 
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  (b) Each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior  to
the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be  canceled
in accordance with Section 2.6(a) and other than Dissenting Shares)  shall be
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive an amount  in cash,
without interest, equal to the quotient of (i) (1) $175,000,000 (the  "Merger
Consideration"), plus (2) the Closing Cash, plus (3) the Aggregate  Exercise
Price, plus (4) the Transaction Tax Benefit, plus (5) the amount, if  any, by
which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Targeted  Net
Working Capital Amount, less the sum of (x) Unpaid Company Transaction 
Expenses, plus (y) all Closing Debt, plus (z) the amount, if any, by which 
the Targeted Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Net Working 
Capital Amount, divided by (ii) the Fully Diluted Common Number (such
result,  the "Per Share Common Merger Consideration"). All such shares of
Company  Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall  automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder of a Company 
Certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock, as 
applicable, shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the 
right to receive the Per Share Common Merger Consideration with respect to 
such shares of Company Common Stock.  (c) Each share of Company Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time (other
than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted  at the Effective Time into the
right to receive an amount in cash (adjusted  to the nearest one-hundredth of
a cent), without interest, equal to (i) the  number of shares of Company
Common Stock into which such share of Company  Preferred Stock would have
been convertible immediately prior to the  Effective Time, multiplied by (ii)
the Per Share Common Merger Consideration  (the "Per Share Preferred Merger
Consideration," and together with the Per  Share Common Merger Consideration,
the "Per Share Merger Consideration")).  All such shares of Company Preferred
Stock, when so converted, shall no  longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired, and  each holder of a Company
Certificate representing any such shares of Company  Preferred Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except  the right to receive
the Per Share Preferred Merger Consideration with  respect to such shares of
Company Preferred Stock.  (d) Each issued and outstanding share of the
capital stock of Merger Sub shall  be converted into and become as of the
Effective Time one (1) fully paid and  nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of the  Surviving Corporation.  SECTION 2.7
Treatment of Company Options.   (a) Vested Company Options. At the Effective
Time, each Company Option that is vested and that has not been exercised
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled in consideration of payment to
the holder thereof (each, an "Optionholder") of an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of each unexercised vested
Company Option held by such Optionholder as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share Common
Merger Consideration less (y) the exercise price per share of such Company
Option (such amount an "Option Payment"). The Company shall take all
necessary actions, including providing any required notice to Optionholders,
necessary to effect the transactions described in this Section 2.7(a)
pursuant to the terms of the Company Option Plan and any agreement evidencing
a vested Company Option.   (b) Unvested Company Options. Each unvested
Company Option shall be deemed vested as of the Effective Time and shall be
treated as a vested Company Option in accordance with Section
2.7(a).  SECTION 2.8 Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment.   (a)
Estimated Merger Consideration. Not later than three Business Days before the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent and the Equityholders\'
Representative a certificate of the Company (the "Company Pre-Closing
Certificate") executed on its behalf by the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company that sets forth in reasonable detail the Company\'s estimates of the
Company Net Working Capital Amount (the "Estimated Net Working
Capital Amount"), Closing Cash ("Estimated Closing Cash"), Closing Debt
("Estimated Closing Debt") and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses
("Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses"), along with the supporting
detail therefor, such estimates to be prepared in accordance with GAAP, using
the policies, conventions, methodologies and procedures used by the Company
in preparing the Company Financial Statements, and the Company\'s estimate of
the Transaction Tax Benefit ("Estimated Transaction Tax Benefit") along with
supporting detail therefor, such estimate to be prepared in accordance with
the Transaction Tax Benefit Schedule. Prior to Closing, the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in good faith to agree upon the calculation of the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Estimated Closing Cash, Estimated
Closing Debt, Estimated Transaction Tax Benefit and Estimated Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses upon which the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid
at Closing shall be based; provided, that, if the Company and Parent are
unable to agree as to any item set forth on the Company Pre-Closing
Certificate, then the amount set forth as the Estimated Net Working Capital
Amount, Estimated Closing Cash, Estimated Closing Debt, Estimated Transaction
Tax Benefit or Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, as applicable,
on the Company Pre-Closing Certificate shall be an estimate of Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount, Estimated Closing Cash, Estimated Closing Debt,
Estimated Transaction Tax Benefit or Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses, as applicable, agreed to by the parties.   (b) Calculation. As
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 45 days following the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall, at its expense, (i) cause to
be prepared, in accordance with GAAP, using the policies, conventions,
methodologies and procedures used by the Company in preparing the Company
Financial Statements, an unaudited balance sheet of the Company on or prior
to the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
but which shall not reflect the transactions occurring at the Closing (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"), together with a statement (the "Closing Date
Schedule") setting forth in reasonable detail the Surviving
Corporation\'s calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing
Cash, Closing Debt, Transaction Tax Benefit and Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses and (ii) deliver to the Equityholders\' Representative the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Schedule, together with a certificate of
the Surviving Corporation executed on its behalf by its Chief Financial
Officer confirming that the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Date
Schedule were properly prepared in good faith and in accordance with GAAP,
using the policies, conventions, methodologies and procedures used by the
Company in preparing the Company Financial Statements and that the
Transaction Tax Benefit was calculated in accordance with the Transaction Tax
Benefit Schedule.   (c) Review; Disputes.   (i) From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide the Equityholders\'
Representative and any accountants or advisors retained by the
Equityholders\' Representative with full access to the books and records of
the Surviving Corporation for the purposes of: (A) enabling the
Equityholders\' Representative and its accountants and advisors to calculate,
and to review the Surviving Corporation\'s calculation of, the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Transaction Tax
Benefit and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses; and (B) identifying any
dispute related to the calculation of any of the Closing Net Working Capital
Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Transaction Tax Benefit and Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses in the Closing Date Schedule.   (ii) If the
Equityholders\' Representative disputes the calculation of any of the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Transaction Tax
Benefit or Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing Date
Schedule, then the Equityholders\' Representative shall deliver a written
notice (a "Dispute Notice") to the Surviving Corporation and the Escrow Agent
at any time during the 40-day period commencing upon receipt by the
Equityholders\' Representative of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing
Date Schedule and the related certificate of the Surviving Corporation\'s
Chief Financial Officer, all as prepared by the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with the requirements of Section 2.8(b) (subject to extension for
any period of inadequate access to the underlying records) (the "Review
Period"). The Dispute Notice shall set forth the basis for the dispute of any
such calculation in reasonable detail.   (iii) If the Equityholders\'
Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice to the Surviving Corporation
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Surviving Corporation\'s
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing
Debt, Transaction Tax Benefit and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses set
forth in the Closing Date Schedule shall be deemed final and binding on
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Equityholders\' Representative and the
Equityholders for all purposes of this Agreement.   (iv) If the
Equityholders\' Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to the Surviving
Corporation prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the
Equityholders\' Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Transaction Tax Benefit and
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses. If the Equityholders\' Representative
and the Surviving Corporation are unable to reach agreement on the Closing
Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Transaction Tax
Benefit and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses within 30 days after the
end of the Review Period, either party shall have the right to refer such
dispute to an independent accountant of national standing reasonably
acceptable to Parent and Equityholders\' Representative (such firm, or any
successor thereto, being referred to herein as the "Accounting Firm") after
such 30th day. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by the
Accounting Firm: (i) each of the Surviving Corporation and the
Equityholders\' Representative shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet
with the Accounting Firm to provide their views as to any disputed issues
with respect to the calculation of any of the Closing Net Working Capital
Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Transaction Tax Benefit and Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses; (ii) the Accounting Firm shall determine the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Transaction
Tax Benefit and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement within 30 days of such referral and upon reaching
such determination shall deliver a copy of its calculations (the "Expert
Calculations") to the Equityholders\' Representative, Surviving Corporation
and the Escrow Agent; and (iii) the determination made by the Accounting Firm
of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt,
Transaction Tax Benefit and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses shall
be final and binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Equityholders\' Representative and the Equityholders for all purposes of this
Agreement, absent manifest error. In calculating the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Transaction Tax Benefit and
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, the Accounting Firm (i) shall be limited
to addressing any particular disputes referred to in the Dispute Notice and
(ii) such calculation shall, with respect to any disputed item, be no greater
than the higher amount calculated by the Equityholders\' Representative or
the Surviving Corporation, and no lower than the amount calculated by the
Equityholders\' Representative or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be. The Expert Calculations shall reflect in detail the differences, if any,
between the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing Debt,
Transaction Tax Benefit and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses reflected
therein and the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Cash, Closing
Debt, Transaction Tax Benefit and Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses set
forth in the Closing Date Schedule. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm shall be borne equally by the Surviving Corporation and
the Equityholders\' Representative.   (d) Payment Upon Final Determination
of Adjustments.   (i) If (A) the sum of the Closing Net Working Capital
Amount, Transaction Tax Benefit and Closing Cash, less Closing Debt and
Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, as finally estimated in accordance with
Section 2.8(a), is less than (B) the sum of the Estimated Net Working Capital
Amount, Estimated Transaction Tax Benefit and Estimated Closing Cash, less
Estimated Closing Debt and Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, as
finally determined in accordance with Section 2.8(c), by an amount greater
than $100,000 then the Surviving Corporation shall receive the amount of such
deficiency (from dollar one) first from the Adjustment Escrow Fund and then,
to the extent necessary, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund. For the avoidance of
doubt, no payment shall be made by Escrow Agent to the Surviving Corporation
in the event that such difference is not greater than $100,000.   (ii) If
(A) the sum of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Transaction Tax
Benefit and Closing Cash, less Closing Debt and Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses, as finally determined in accordance with Section 2.8(c), is greater
than (B) the sum of the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Estimated
Transaction Tax Benefit and Estimated Closing Cash, less Estimated Closing
Debt and Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, as finally estimated
in accordance with Section 2.8(a), by an amount greater than $100,000, then
the Surviving Corporation shall, no later than three Business Days after such
determination (or, if such Equityholder has not exchanged
such Equityholder\'s Company Certificates pursuant to Article III, then upon
such exchange by such Equityholder), cause to be paid to each Equityholder
by delivery of immediately available funds to such Equityholder an amount
equal to the product of such excess (from dollar one) multiplied by such
Equityholder\'s Applicable Percentage. For the avoidance of doubt, no payment
shall be made by the Surviving Corporation to the Equityholders in the event
that such difference is not greater than $100,000.   (iii) To the extent
that any amounts remain in the Adjustment Escrow Fund after any payment to
the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.8(d)(i) or to the
Equityholders pursuant to Section 2.8(d)(ii), then such remaining amount
multiplied by the respective Equityholders\' Applicable Percentage shall
immediately be released from the Adjustment Escrow Fund and paid to the
respective Equityholders.   ARTICLE III.  EXCHANGE OF COMPANY
CERTIFICATES  SECTION 3.1 Exchange of Company Certificates.  (a) Payment.
At the Closing, (i) each Equityholder shall deliver to the  Surviving
Corporation for cancellation the stock certificates and/or  agreements
representing such Equityholder\'s shares of Company Capital Stock  and
Company Options (collectively, such Equityholder\'s "Company  Certificates"),
(ii) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation  to pay the
aggregate amount to be paid to Equityholders pursuant to Section  2.6 and
Section 2.7 to the account or accounts designated by the  Equityholders\'
Representative by means of a wire transfer of immediately  available funds,
against delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal,  in a form agreed
upon by Parent and the Company prior to the execution of  this Agreement, and
surrender of Company Certificates for cancellation,  except that the sums of
$500,000 (the "Adjustment Escrow Fund") and  $8,750,000 (the "Indemnity
Escrow Fund," and together with the Adjustment  Escrow Fund, the "Escrow
Fund") shall be deducted, pro rata in proportion to  each Equityholder\'s
Applicable Percentage, from such aggregate amount and  delivered to the
escrow agent mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent  prior to the
Closing (the "Escrow Agent") to hold in accordance with the  terms of the
escrow agreement to be executed at Closing by Parent, the Escrow  Agent and
the Equityholders\' Representative in substantially the form  attached hereto
as Exhibit B (the "Escrow Agreement"), and (iii) Parent  shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to deliver the Escrow Fund to  the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Without limiting the  generality of
the foregoing, upon the request of Parent, the Equityholders\' 
Representative shall appoint a payment agent to which Parent shall make a 
lump sum payment in satisfaction of its obligations pursuant to Section 2.6 
and to facilitate the payment of Closing Debt and Company Transaction 
Expenses; provided, however, that all obligations pursuant to Section 2.7 
shall be remitted through the Company\'s payroll system in accordance with 
Section 3.4.  (b) Exchange Procedures. To the extent that an Equityholder
has not delivered  the Company Certificates representing all of such
Equityholder\'s shares of  Company Capital Stock or Company Options as of the
Closing, then, promptly  after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall mail to such  Equityholder: (i) a letter of transmittal which shall
specify that the  delivery of the consideration to be paid to such
Equityholder under this  Agreement shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to Company Capital  Stock and Company Options held by such Equityholder
shall pass, only upon  delivery of the applicable Company Certificates and
shall contain  representations and warranties as to ownership and title to
such Company  Capital Stock or Company Options, and (ii) instructions for
effecting the  surrender of each Company Certificate in exchange for the
amount to be paid  to such Equityholder pursuant to Section 2.6 and Section
2.7. Upon surrender  of a Company Certificate for cancellation to the
Surviving Corporation,  together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed  in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the Company Certificates so  surrendered shall forthwith be canceled, and the
holder of the Company  Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, subject to  Section 3.1(a), the consideration payable to such
holder pursuant to Section  2.6 and/or Section 2.7, as the case may be,
without interest thereon, as such  amounts may be adjusted pursuant to
Section 2.8. Until so surrendered, each  outstanding Company Certificate
shall be deemed from and after the Effective  Time, for all corporate
purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the  payments pursuant to
Section 2.6 and/or Section 2.7, as such amounts may be  adjusted pursuant to
Section 2.8.  (c) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Company Certificates. If any
Company Certificate  shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the
making of an  affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company
Certificate to be  lost, stolen or destroyed and (ii) the execution and
delivery to the  Surviving Corporation by such Person of an indemnity
agreement in customary  form and substance, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall, subject to  Section 3.1(a), issue, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company  Certificate, the amount of cash, without
interest, that such Person would  have been entitled to receive had such
Person surrendered such lost, stolen  or destroyed Company Certificate to the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to  Section 2.6(b), Section 2.6(c), Section
2.6(d) or Section 2.7, as such  amounts may be adjusted pursuant to Section
2.8.  (d) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 3.1,  neither the Company, Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to  any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any  abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.  SECTION 3.2
Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary and subject to Section 8.2(f), if required by the DGCL, but only to
the extent required thereby, shares of Company Capital Stock which are
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are
held by holders of such shares of Company Capital Stock who have properly
exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with the DGCL
(the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, and holders of such shares of Company
Capital Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the provisions of the
DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or
lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL; provided however
the appraised value, including any interest thereon, of such shares in excess
of the Per Share Merger Consideration along with all costs associated with
the appraisal process (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney
fees of Parent and Merger Sub and all court costs) shall be paid from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund without regard to the limitations contained in Section
10.3(b). If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Capital
Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to
have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other related
instruments received by the Company. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demand.  SECTION 3.3 No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company
Capital Stock; Closing of Company Transfer Books. At and after the Effective
Time, each holder of Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights as
a stockholder of the Company, except for, in the case of a holder of Company
Capital Stock (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.6(a)
or Dissenting Shares), the right to surrender his or her Company Certificate
in exchange for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration or, in the case
of a holder of Dissenting Shares, to perfect his or her right to receive
payment for his or her shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the DGCL,
and no transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock shall be made on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of shares of
Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided for in this Agreement.  SECTION 3.4
Withholding Rights. Parent and t(a) he Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Equityholder such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law (including under Section 1445 of the Code, if applicable); provided,
however, that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall notify any
Equityholder from whom funds are properly withheld of the amount of such
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the foregoing, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Equityholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE IV.  REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub, the
Company shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a disclosure schedule with
numbered sections corresponding to the relevant sections in this Agreement
(the "Company Disclosure Schedule"). Any exception or qualification set forth
in the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to a particular
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein shall be deemed to be
an exception or qualification with respect to all other applicable
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement.
Nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to broaden the scope
of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained in this
Agreement. Subject to the exceptions and qualifications set forth in
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:  SECTION 4.1 Authority(a) .  (a) The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder, and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized by the
Board of Directors of the Company, and no other corporate action on the part
of the Company is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, other than the Required Company Stockholder Vote. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties to this
Agreement, this Agreement constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.
The affirmative vote or consent of (i) the holders of a majority of the
shares of the outstanding Company Capital Stock voting or consenting, as the
case may be, on an as-if-converted to Company Common Stock basis, (ii) the
holders of a majority of the shares of the outstanding Company Series A-1
Preferred Stock and (iii) the holders of a majority of the shares of the
outstanding Company Series A-3 Preferred Stock are the only votes of
the holders of any Company Capital Stock necessary under the DGCL and the
Company Certificate of Incorporation to adopt this Agreement (the "Required
Company Stockholder Vote").  (b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at
a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously duly adopted resolutions (i)
determining that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, are advisable and are fair to and in the best interest
of the Company\'s stockholders, (ii) approving this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger which approval
satisfies in full the requirements of the DGCL that the Agreement be approved
by the Company\'s Board of Directors, and (iii) resolving to recommend
approval and adoption of this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders at the
Company Stockholders Meeting (the recommendations referred to in this clause
(iii) are collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "Recommendations"
and are subject to the right of the Board of Directors of the Company to make
subsequent determinations in accordance with Section 7.5(c) below). The
Company has been orally advised that all of its directors who hold Company
Common Stock intend to vote in favor of the Merger.  SECTION 4.2
Organization. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate or lease
the properties and assets now owned, operated or leased by it, and to carry
on the Business in all material respects. The Company is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing, under the Laws of
each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties owned, operated or
leased, or the nature of its activities, makes such qualification necessary,
except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, when taken together with all other failures by the Company to be so
qualified or in good standing, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. True
and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation (the "Company
Certificate of Incorporation") and Bylaws (the "Company Bylaws") of the
Company, each as amended and in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
been made available to Parent or its advisors. The Company has no
Subsidiaries.  SECTION 4.3 Company Capital Stock.  (a) As of the date of
this Agreement, the Company Capital Stock consists of 15,225,000 shares, of
which 8,000,000 shares have been designated Company Common Stock and
7,225,000 shares have been designated Company Preferred Stock, of which
1,000,000 shares have been designated Series A-1 Preferred Stock, 1,657,000

qualified to do business as a foreign corporation, and is in good standing,
under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the character of its properties
owned, operated or leased, or the nature of its activities, makes such
qualification necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing, when taken together with all other
failures by Parent to be so qualified or in good standing, would not have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent to perform its obligations
under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  SECTION 5.3 Conflicts. Assuming all consents, approvals,
authorizations, filings and notifications and other actions set forth in
Section 5.4 have been obtained or made, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by each of Parent
and Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder, and the consummation by each of
Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
does not and will not (i) conflict with or result in a violation of the
organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) conflict with or
result in a violation of any Governmental Order or Law applicable to Parent
or Merger Sub or their respective assets or properties; or (iii) result in a
material breach of, or constitute a material default (or event which with the
giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a material default)
under, or give rise to any rights of termination, amendment, modification,
acceleration or cancellation of or loss of any benefit under, or result in
the creation of any Encumbrance on any of the assets or properties of Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to, any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a
party, or by which any of the assets or properties of Parent or Merger Sub is
bound or affected, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this
Section 5.3, as would not have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to perform its respective obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  SECTION 5.4 Consents, Approvals, Etc. No consent, waiver,
approval, authorization, order or permit of, or declaration, filing or
registration with, or notification to, any Governmental Authority or third
party is required to be made or obtained by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of
its respective obligations hereunder, or the consummation by each of Parent
and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (i)
the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to the DGCL; (ii) applicable
requirements, if any, under the DGCL, federal or state securities or "blue
sky" Laws; (iii) such filings as may be required under the HSR Act; and (iv)
where the failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or action,
or to make such filing or notification would not, when taken together with
all other such failures by Parent and Merger Sub, have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its respective
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.  SECTION 5.5 Litigation and Governmental Orders. As of
the date of this Agreement, (i) there are no Actions pending against Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Subsidiaries of Parent ("Parent Subsidiaries"), or
any of the assets or properties of Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent
Subsidiaries, or any of the directors or officers of Parent, Merger Sub or
any Parent Subsidiaries in their capacity as directors or officers of Parent,
Merger Sub or any Parent Subsidiaries that would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its respective
obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Subsidiaries and
their respective assets and properties are not subject to any material
Governmental Order that would prevent either Parent or Merger Sub from
performing its respective obligations under this Agreement or consummating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  SECTION 5.6 Solvency. As
of the Closing, and after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent.
For purposes of this Section 5.6, "Solvent" means that, with respect to any
Person and as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the
"present fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person, will, as of such
date, exceed the amount of all "liabilities of such Person, contingent or
otherwise," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in
accordance with applicable federal laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, (ii) the present fair saleable value of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, be greater than the amount that will be
required to pay the liability of such Person on its indebtedness as its
indebtedness becomes absolute and matured, (iii) such Person will not have,
as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital with which to
conduct its business and (iv) such Person will be able to pay its
indebtedness as it matures. For purposes of the foregoing definition only,
"indebtedness" means a liability in connection with another Person\'s (y)
right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment,
liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured or (z) right to
any equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a
right of payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced
to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
secured or unsecured.  SECTION 5.7 Financing. Parent has sufficient funds
or financing in place to fund the Merger Consideration to be paid at Closing
and its other obligations hereunder.  SECTION 5.8 Due Diligence
Investigation. Parent has had an opportunity to discuss the business,
management, operations and finances of the Company with the Company\'s
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and affiliates, and
has had an opportunity to inspect the facilities of the Company. Parent has
conducted its own independent investigation of the Company. In making its
decision to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent has relied solely
upon the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article
IV (and acknowledges that such representations and warranties are the
only representations and warranties made by the Company) and has not relied
upon any other information provided by, for or on behalf of the Company, or
its agents or representatives, to Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent has entered into the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the understanding, acknowledgement and
agreement that no representations or warranties, express or implied, are made
with respect to future prospects (financial or otherwise) of the Company.
Parent acknowledges that, except as expressly provided in Article VI, no
current or former stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate or
advisor of the Company has made or is making any representations, warranties
or commitments whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement,
express or implied.  SECTION 5.9 Brokers. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities,
Inc. (the fees and expenses of which shall be paid in full by Parent), no
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s
or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement based upon any arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates.  SECTION 5.10 No Prior
Activities. Merger Sub has not incurred nor will it incur any liabilities or
obligations, except those incurred in connection with its organization and
with the negotiation of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger. Except as contemplated by this Agreement,
Merger Sub had not engaged in any business activities of any type or kind
whatsoever, or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any
Person, or become subject to or bound by any obligation or undertaking. As of
the date of this Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of Merger Sub is owned beneficially and of record by Parent, free and clear
of all Encumbrances (other than those created by this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).   ARTICLE VI.

represents and warrants to Parent, severally and not jointly, as
follows:  SECTION 6.1 Authorization. Such Equityholder has full legal

Period, the Company shall not, and shall direct its  officers, directors,

request the return or destruction of any confidential information from all 
such Persons.  (b) The Company shall immediately notify Parent orally and in

commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and terminating
upon the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section 9.1 (the "Pre-Closing

Access to Information. Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
(which Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge is fully applicable to it),
during the Pre-Closing Period, upon reasonable notice and during
normal business hours, the Company shall, and shall cause the officers,
employees, auditors and agents of the Company to, (i) afford the officers,
employees and authorized agents and representatives of Parent reasonable
access to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company and (ii)
furnish to the officers, employees and authorized agents and representatives
of Parent such additional financial and operating data and other information
regarding the assets, properties and business of the Company as Parent may
from time to time reasonably request in order to assist Parent in fulfilling
its obligations under this Agreement and to facilitate the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
Parent shall not interfere with any of the operations or business activities
of the Company.  SECTION 7.4 Confidentiality. Parent and Merger Sub hereby
agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference and
shall continue in full force and effect until the Effective Time, such that
the information obtained by Parent and Merger Sub, or their respective
officers, employees, agents or representatives, during any investigation
conducted pursuant to Section 7.3, or in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or otherwise, shall be governed by the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.  SECTION 7.5 Efforts; Consents; Regulatory
and Other Authorizations.  (a) Each party to this Agreement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to promptly consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) obtain
all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of, and give all notices

the other parties to this Agreement in promptly seeking to obtain all
such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, giving such notices, and
making such filings. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining such
consents from third parties, no party to this Agreement shall be required to
make payments, commence litigation or agree to modifications of the terms and
conditions of any agreements with third parties, and except for modifications
which would not have a Material Adverse Effect, no such modifications shall
be made to any Contract of the Company without the consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
parties to this Agreement shall not take any action that is reasonably likely
to have the effect of unreasonably delaying, impairing or impeding the
receipt of any required authorizations, consents, orders or approvals.  (b)
In furtherance and not in limitation of the terms of Section 7.5(a), to
the extent required by applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall
file, or cause to be filed, a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the
HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
within five (5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement (including, in
the case of Parent, a request for early termination of the applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act), shall supply promptly any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority
(including the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice
and the United States Federal Trade Commission) pursuant to the HSR Act, and
shall cooperate in connection with any filing under applicable antitrust Laws
and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced by any
Governmental Authority, including the United States Federal Trade Commission,
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, or the
office of any state attorney general.  (c) In furtherance of and not in
limitation of the terms of Section 7.5(a), the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the adoption of this Agreement by its
stockholders to the extent required by the DGCL for the consummation of the
Merger. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as promptly as
practicable following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall submit this Agreement to the Company\'s stockholders
for adoption at a meeting of the Company\'s stockholders or by written
consent of the Company\'s stockholders, which shall be called and held or
solicited, as the case may be, in accordance with the requirements of the
DGCL and the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws (the
"Company Stockholder Meeting/Consent"). The materials submitted to the
Company\'s stockholders in connection with the Company Stockholder
Meeting/Consent shall include information regarding the Company, the terms of
this Agreement and the Merger and the unanimous recommendation of the
Company\'s Board of Directors that the Company\'s stockholders vote their
shares of Company Capital Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Company\'s Board of Directors may change such
Recommendation only if the Company\'s Board of Directors determines that it
must take such action in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and provided further, that no such change shall relieve the
Company of its obligation to call and hold or seek, as the case may be, the
Company Stockholder Meeting/Consent pursuant to this
Section 7.5(c).  SECTION 7.6 Further Action. Subject to the terms and
conditions provided in this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, or cause to be
delivered, such further certificates, instruments and other documents, and to
take, or cause to be taken, such further actions, as may be necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  SECTION 7.7 Indemnification;
Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance.  (a) Subject to, and contingent on the
Equityholders obtaining the insurance policy required in Section 7.7(b),
until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director and officer of the Company (collectively, the
"Company Indemnified Parties"), against any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by any of the Company Indemnified Parties in connection with any
Liabilities or any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the
Company would have been permitted under applicable Law and under the Company
Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws, in each case as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, to indemnify such Company Indemnified Parties and
(ii) advance expenses as incurred by any Company Indemnified Party in
connection with any matters for which such Company Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification from Parent pursuant to this Section 7.7(a) to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law or, if greater, under the
Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws; provided, however,
that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately and finally determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction and all rights of appeal have lapsed
that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification under
applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company Bylaws,
and pursuant to this Section 7.7(a).  (b) For a period of six (6) years
following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation for itself to maintain, in effect a directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy covering those persons who are
currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance policy (copies of which have been heretofore delivered by the
Company to Parent and its agents and representatives) with coverage in amount
and scope at least as favorable as the Company\'s existing
coverage; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in the aggregate in excess of two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for
such coverage, and if such premium would at any time exceed two hundred fifty
percent (250%) of such amount, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain insurance policies which provide the maximum and best coverage
available at an annual premium equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of
such amount; and provided, further, that this Section 7.7(b) shall be deemed
to have been satisfied if a prepaid policy or policies (i.e., "tail
coverage") have been obtained by the Company which policy or policies provide
such directors and officers with the coverage described in this Section
7.7(b) for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing
Date, including with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  (c) The terms and provisions of this Section 7.7 are intended to
be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the Company Indemnified
Parties by applicable Law, charter, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and representatives, each of whom is an intended
third party beneficiary of this Section 7.7.  SECTION 7.8 Employee Benefit
Matters.  (a) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant under
any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, Company Employees as of the Effective Time
shall receive service credit for service with the Company to the same extent
such service credit was granted under the Company Benefit Plans, subject to
offsets for previously accrued benefits and no duplication of benefits.
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i) to the extent Company
Employees provide Parent with a HIPAA certificate waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees
under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that
have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare benefit
plan maintained for the Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) to the extent such expense information can be obtained,
verified by the insurance company and entered into the insurance company\'s
system, provide each Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans (other than
a Company Benefit Plan) that such employees are eligible to participate in
immediately after the Effective Time.  (b) For a period of twelve (12)
months following the Closing, Parent shall provide (or cause the Surviving
Corporation or another Affiliate of Parent to provide) to employees of the
Surviving Corporation or any other Affiliate of Parent who were employees of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees")
base compensation, bonus opportunities and employee benefits (other than
equity-based compensation arrangements) ("Employee Benefits") which are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the Employee Benefits provided
to the employees of the Company immediately prior to the Closing. Thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or other Affiliate of Parent)
to provide Employee Benefits to the Continuing Employees which are comparable
in all material respects to those employee benefits generally provided to
employees employed by Parent or other Subsidiaries of Parent and are
consistent with industry standards for companies of similar size.  SECTION
7.9 Provision Respecting Legal Representation. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Latham
and Watkins LLP may serve as counsel to each and any holder of Company Capital
Stock and their respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the
"Holder Group"), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Latham
and Watkins LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Holder Group or
any director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Holder
Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement notwithstanding such representation and each of the parties hereto
hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom, and each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to
consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from such
representation.  SECTION 7.10 Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes, if any,
arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne by Parent.  SECTION 7.11 Disclosure Schedules;
Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules. From time to time prior to the
Closing, the Company shall have the right to supplement or amend the Company
Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter hereafter arising or
discovered after the delivery of the Company Disclosure Schedule pursuant to
this Agreement; provided, however, that such supplements or amendments to the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to amend or otherwise modify
the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered on the date hereof or the
representations and warranties of the Company contained herein;
provided, further, if the Closing shall occur, then Parent and Merger Sub
shall be deemed to have waived any right or claim pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement or otherwise with respect to any and all matters disclosed
pursuant to any such supplement or amendment at or prior to the
Closing.  SECTION 7.12 Continued Association with the Company. During the
Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts in
collaboration with Parent and Merger Sub to encourage all of the senior
management of the Company to continue their employment until the Closing and
thereupon to accept and continue employment with the Surviving

Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, guaranty or place cash
on deposit with the issuing bank effective upon the Closing in respect of its
then-outstanding but undrawn letters of credit issued on behalf of the
Company in the ordinary course of business.  SECTION 7.14 Code Section 280G
Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall submit to a
stockholder vote (along with adequate disclosure satisfying the requirements
of Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) and any regulations promulgated thereunder)
the right of any "disqualified individual" with respect to the Company
(within the meaning of Code Section 280G(c)) to receive any payment that
would constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Code Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i)) and as to which such individual waives his or her rights as
described in the following sentence in a manner that satisfies
the shareholder approval requirements of Code Section 280G(b)(5) and any
regulations promulgated thereunder to the extent necessary to cause any such
payment to not constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Code Section 280G(b)(1). To the extent that any such "disqualified
individual" has the right to receive payments that could constitute
"parachute payments" and elects to waive such rights, the Company shall
obtain waivers of such rights prior to soliciting the vote described in the
immediately preceding sentence such that the vote shall, if successful,
establish each "disqualified individual\'s" right to the payment. The Company
shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Parent a draft of all stockholder
vote related documents, including, but not limited to, any disclosure
documents and "disqualified individual" waivers. The Company shall
incorporate any reasonable comments that are made by Parent. Parent
shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in connection with the
preparation of such stockholder vote related documents.  SECTION 7.15 Drag-
Along Rights. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Equityholders holding a sufficient number of shares of Company Preferred
Stock to exercise their "drag-along rights" as described in the Stockholders
Agreement.  SECTION 7.16 Payment of Closing Debt and Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses. With respect to the Closing Debt and Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses described in the definition of Merger Consideration,
Parent shall pay those funds to (a) holders of Closing Debt and (b) those
persons entitled to payment of Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses as
directed in writing by the Equityholders\' Representative (the "Letter of
Direction").   ARTICLE VIII.  CONDITIONS TO CLOSING  SECTION 8.1

and agreements set forth in this Agreement to be performed or complied with
by Parent and Merger Sub at or prior to the Effective Time shall have been

Effect, Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as provided
in Section 9.1(f).  (b) No Governmental Order. No Governmental Authority
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Governmental

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  SECTION 9.1 Termination. This Agreement
may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:  (a) by the mutual
written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;  (b) by either the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, by
written notice to the other party if any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over such matters shall have issued a Governmental
Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
Governmental Order shall have become final and unappealable; provided,
however, that the terms of this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any
party unless such party shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
oppose any such Governmental Order or to have such Governmental Order vacated
or made inapplicable to the Merger or other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement to which such Governmental Order relates;  (c) by either the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, by
written notice to the other party if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before August 31, 2007, unless the failure to
consummate the Merger on or prior to such date is the result of any breach of
this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate the Agreement pursuant to
the terms of this Section 9.1(c);  (d) by either Parent or the Company, if
the other shall have breached, or failed to comply with, in any material
respect any of its obligations under this Agreement, or any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement by such other party shall have been incorrect
in any material respect when made or shall have since ceased to be true and
correct in any material respect, and such breach, failure or
misrepresentations is not cured within fifteen (15) days after written notice
thereof and such breaches, failures or misrepresentations, individually or in
the aggregate and without regard to materiality qualifiers contained therein,
result or would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect;  (e) by Parent, if the approval of the stockholders of the Company
is not obtained at the applicable stockholders meeting, including
adjournments thereof, or if a written consent of stockholders in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent, executed by each of the stockholders that
has executed a Voting Agreement has not been delivered to Parent within 24
hours after the execution of this Agreement; or  (f) by Parent if, prior to
June 22, 2007, the Company and the Equityholders\' Representative shall have
received from Parent a written notice (the "Environmental Notice") that the
Phase I environmental studies conducted on the Company\'s warehouse in
Louisville, Kentucky and the Company\'s headquarters in Portland, Oregon (the
"Phase I Studies") revealed a material environmental uncertainty of the
Company, which Environmental Notice shall include true and correct copies of
the Phase I Studies; provided, however, that Parent shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement if the Company and the
Equityholders\' Representative deliver a written notice to Parent, within
fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the Environmental Notice, in
which the Company and the Equityholders\' Representative notify Parent that
the Equityholders shall be responsible for one-half of the liability
described in the Environmental Notice relating to the environmental
uncertainty identified in the Phase I Studies. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and the Equityholders\' Representative
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the respective landlord to
provide for any indemnification of the Company specified in any Contract
between such landlord and the Company prior to, or as offset by, any payments
by the Equityholders to Parent.   Any right of termination set forth above
shall be exercised by written notice from the terminating party to the other
party.  SECTION 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of
this Agreement and abandonment of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with Section
9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further force or
effect whatsoever and, subject to Section 9.3, there shall be no liability on
the part of any party to this Agreement; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
relieve any party to this Agreement from any liability resulting from or
arising out of any intentional, material breach of any agreement or covenant
hereunder; and provided, further, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
terms of Section 7.4, this Section 9.2 and Article XI shall remain in full
force and effect and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, whether
in accordance with Section 9.1 or otherwise.   ARTICLE X. 
INDEMNIFICATION  SECTION 10.1 Survival of Representations. The
representations and warranties made by the Company and/or the Equityholders
in Article IV, Article VI or in the Ancillary Documents and the covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall
expire on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Expiration Date");
provided, however, that the representations contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2,
4.3, 6.1 and 6.2 shall survive indefinitely (each such representation a
"Fundamental Representation"); and further, provided, that if, at any time
prior to the applicable Expiration Date, (a) Parent (acting in good faith)
delivers to the Equityholders\' Representative a written notice alleging the
existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the representations and
warranties made by the Company in Article IV or in the Ancillary Documents,
or by an Equityholder in Article VI, setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for Parent\'s belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist and
asserting a claim for recovery under Section 10.2 based on such alleged
inaccuracy or breach, or (b) the Equityholders\' Representative (acting in
good faith) delivers to the Parent a written notice alleging the existence of
an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the representations and warranties
made by Parent and Merger Sub in Article V setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for the belief of the Equityholders\' Representative that such an
inaccuracy or breach may exist and asserting a claim for recovery under
Section 10.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach then, in the case of
clause (a) or clause (b), the claim asserted in such notice shall survive
the Expiration Date until such time as such claim is fully and finally
resolved.  SECTION 10.2 Right to Indemnification.  (a) Subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article X, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to be indemnified, solely from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, against any Damages actually incurred by Parent as a proximate result
of: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company or
an Equityholder set forth in Article IV, Article VI or in the Ancillary
Documents; or (ii) any material breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Company or an Equityholder set forth in this Agreement or in the
Ancillary Documents. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X,
to the extent the Escrow Fund is not available, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to be indemnified by the individual
Equityholders, severally and not jointly, against any Damages actually
incurred by Parent as a proximate result of any breach of any representation
or warranty of such Equityholder set forth in Article VI.  (b) Subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article X, from and after the Effective
Time, the Equityholders shall be entitled to be indemnified by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation against any Damages actually incurred by any of the
Equityholders as a proximate result of: (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Parent or the Merger Sub set forth in
Article V or in the Ancillary Documents; or (ii) any material breach of any
covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement.  SECTION 10.3 Limitations on Liability.  (a) From and after the
Effective Time, the right of Parent to be indemnified from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund pursuant to this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in, or any other breach by the Company of, this Agreement. The
right of Parent to be indemnified solely and exclusively from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund shall not apply to claims relating to the breach of a
Fundamental Representation; provided, that in no event shall any Equityholder
be liable to Parent for Damages relating to the breach of Fundamental
Representations in excess of the Merger Consideration actually received by
such Person. Except as provided with respect to the Equityholders in the
immediately preceding sentence, no current or former stockholder, director,
officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of the Company shall have any
Liability of any nature to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in, or any other breach of, this
Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, the right of the Equityholders
to be indemnified pursuant to this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent
or Merger Sub contained in, or any other breach by Parent or Merger Sub of,
this Agreement. No current or former stockholder, director, officer,
employee, affiliate or advisor of Parent or Merger Sub shall have any
Liability of any nature to any Equityholder or any Affiliate of any
Equityholder with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty
contained in, or any other breach of, this Agreement.  (b) Without limiting
the effect of any other limitation contained in this Article X, and except
for the breach of a Fundamental Representation, the indemnification provided
for in Section 10.2 shall not apply except to the extent that the aggregate
Damages against which Parent would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified
under this Article X exceeds $1,750,000, in which event Parent shall, subject
to the other limitations contained herein, be entitled to be indemnified only
against the portion of such Damages in excess of $1,750,000. Any amounts
payable by the Equityholders to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section
10.3 shall be paid solely and exclusively from the Indemnity Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and no holder of Company
Capital Stock, Company Option or any other Person shall be liable for any
deficiency with respect to indemnity pursuant to this Section 10.3 except
with respect to the breach of a Fundamental Representation.  (c) Without
limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this Article X, for
purposes of computing the amount of any Damages incurred by Parent under this
Article X, there shall be deducted an amount equal to the amount of any
insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or
reimbursements received by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with
such Damages or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto (it being
understood that Parent and any of its Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such proceeds, payments or
reimbursements prior to seeking indemnification under this Article X). The
calculation of Damages shall not include losses arising because of a change
after Closing in Law or accounting policy. To the extent that a claim for
indemnification by Parent or Merger Sub hereunder relates to a Liability
incurred by the Company and there is an accrual on the Current Balance Sheet
in respect of such Liability, then the determination of Damages in respect of
such claim shall be net of such accrual.  (d) Without limiting the effect of
any other limitation contained in this Article X, Parent shall not be
entitled to indemnification under this Article X to the extent that such
right of indemnification is addressed in the adjustments to the Per Share
Merger Consideration made following the Closing pursuant to Section 2.8 or as
otherwise referenced on the Closing Balance Sheet.  (e) Without limiting the
effect of any other limitation contained in this Article X, for purposes of
this Agreement, no representation or warranty of the Company or an
Equityholder, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
shall be deemed to be or to have been breached if: (A) Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, had actual knowledge, on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, of the breach of such representation or warranty, or of any facts
or circumstances rendering such representation or warranty inaccurate; or (B)
during the Pre-Closing Period, Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, obtained actual knowledge of the breach of such representation or
warranty, or of any facts or circumstances rendering such representation or
warranty inaccurate, and elected nonetheless to proceed with the
Closing.  (f) Nothing in this Section 10.3 shall limit any remedy Parent or
any of the Equityholders may have against any Person for actual fraud
involving a knowing and intentional misrepresentation of a fact material to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon which such other party
has relied.  SECTION 10.4 Defense of Third-Party Claims.  (a) Upon receipt
by any Person seeking to be indemnified pursuant to Section 10.2 (the
"Indemnitee") of notice of any actual or possible claim, demand,
suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding that has been
or may be brought or asserted by a third party against such Indemnitee and
that may be subject to indemnification hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), the
Indemnitee shall promptly give notice of such Third-Party Claim to the Person
from whom indemnification is sought under Section 10.2 (the "Indemnitor")
indicating the nature of such Third-Party Claim and the stated basis therefor
and the amount of Damages claimed pursuant to such Third-Party Claim, to the
extent known.  (b) The Indemnitor shall have 30 days after receipt of the
Indemnitee\'s notice of a given Third-Party Claim to elect, at its option, to
assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, in which case: (i) the
attorneys\' fees, other professionals\' and experts\' fees and court or
arbitration costs incurred by the Indemnitor in connection with defending
such Third-Party Claim shall be payable by such Indemnitor; (ii) the
Indemnitee shall not be entitled to be indemnified for any costs or expenses
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Third-Party
Claim; (iii) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to monitor such defense at its
sole expense; (iv) the Indemnitee shall make available to the Indemnitor all
books, records and other documents and materials that are under the direct or
indirect control of the Indemnitee or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates and that the Indemnitor considers necessary or desirable for the
defense of such Third-Party Claim; (v) the Indemnitee shall execute such
documents and take such other actions as the Indemnitor may reasonably
request for the purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any settlement,
compromise or adjustment relating to, such Third-Party Claim; (vi) the
Indemnitee shall otherwise fully cooperate as reasonably requested by
the Indemnitor in the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (vii) the Indemnitee
shall not admit any liability with respect to such Third Party Claim; and
(viii) the Indemnitor shall not enter into any agreement providing for the
settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim or the consent to the
entry of a judgment with respect to such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnitor elects not to defend
such Third-Party Claim, then (i) the Indemnitee shall diligently defend such
Third-Party Claim and (ii) the Indemnitee shall have no right to seek
indemnification under this Article X in respect of such Third-Party Claim for
any agreement providing for the settlement or compromise of such Third-Party
Claim or the consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to such Third-
Party Claim entered into without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
provided, however, in no event shall the maximum aggregate Liability of the
Equityholders for indemnification claims payable by the Equityholders
hereunder exceed the Indemnity Escrow Fund.  SECTION 10.5 Limitation on
Damages. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY PROVIDED FOR UNDER ANY
APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO PARTY NOR ANY
EQUITYHOLDER OR EQUITYHOLDERS\' REPRESENTATIVE SHALL, IN ANY EVENT, BE LIABLE
TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES RELATING TO THE BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH HEREOF (EXCEPT
THOSE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF A THIRD PARTY CLAIM).  SECTION 10.6
Characterization of Indemnification Payments. The parties agree that any
indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article X shall be treated for
all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the purchase price unless otherwise
required by Law.  SECTION 10.7 Allocation of Certain Indemnification
Obligations; Special Payment Procedures. In the event that any claim for
Damages made by Parent pursuant to Section 10.2 constitutes Damages for which
the Equityholders who were holders of Company Capital Stock prior to December
6, 2004 (such Equityholders, with respect to such shares, the "Pre-2005
Indemnified Stockholders") are entitled to contribution or indemnification
from certain prior stockholders of the Company in accordance with the
Contribution Agreement dated December 6, 2004 (a "Special Allocated Loss"),
then such Special Allocated Loss shall, to the extent Parent is entitled to
indemnification therefor pursuant to the terms of Section 10.2, be the
obligation of the Pre-2005 Indemnified Equityholders and not the
other Equityholders. The Equityholders\' Representative shall notify the
Parent in writing if any claim for Damages constitutes such Special Allocated
Loss. Prior to the payment from the Indemnity Escrow Fund of any amount to
Parent in respect of any such Special Allocated Loss, the Equityholders\'
Representative or its designee shall have thirty (30) days in which to seek
contribution from persons who were stockholders of the Company prior to
December 6, 2004 ("Pre-2005 Stockholders"), which payment (if any) will be
made directly to Parent and shall offset dollar-for-dollar the Parent\'s
claim on the Indemnity Escrow Fund for any Special Allocated Loss or any
other Damages for which the Parent may be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.2. If any amount of Special Allocated Loss is not paid
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence within the specified time
period, such amount shall then be payable from the Escrow Indemnity Fund in
accordance with this Article X and the Escrow Agreement; provided, however,
that the amounts (if any) paid from the Indemnity Escrow Fund with respect to
a Special Allocated Loss shall be an obligation of the Indemnified Pre-2005
Stockholders and accordingly shall be allocated, pro rata, among the
Indemnified Pre-2005 Stockholders, with the actual allocation to be
in accordance with a schedule to be provided by the Equityholders
Representative to the Parent and the Escrow Agent in writing; provided,
further, that in the event the portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund allocated
to the Indemnified Pre-2005 Stockholders shall be entirely exhausted, any
then unpaid Special Allocated Loss shall be recovered by Parent from the
remaining Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any. Without limiting the generality of
Article XI, Parent is expressly authorized to rely on any written notice of
the Equityholders\' Representative contemplated by this Section 10.7, and no
Equityholder or any other Person shall have any claim of any sort whatsoever
against Parent or the Escrow Agent for acting in reliance thereon. FOR THE
AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION 10.7 IS TO FACILITATE
THE ALLOCATION OF CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS
ARTICLE X BY AND AMONG THE PRESENT EQUITYHOLDERS AND CERTAIN
PRIOR STOCKHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY AS A FINANCIAL MATTER, AND SHALL NOT
ADVERSELY AFFECT IN ANY MANNER THE ULTIMATE RIGHT OF THE PARENT TO RECOVER
DAMAGES FROM THE INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW FUND UPON THE TERMS AND SUBJECT TO
THE CONDITIONS AND OTHER LIMITATIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.   ARTICLE XI. 
GENERAL PROVISIONS  SECTION 11.1 Equityholders\' Representative.  (a)
Appointment. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement by the
Company\'s stockholders, and without further action of any Company
stockholder, each Equityholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably
constituted and appointed Castanea Partners, Inc. (and by execution of this
Agreement it hereby accepts such appointment) as agent and attorney-in-fact
("Equityholders\' Representative") for and on behalf of the Equityholders (in
their capacity as such), with full power of substitution, to act in the name,
place and stead of each Equityholder with respect to Section 2.8, Article X
and the Escrow Agreement and the taking by the Equityholders\' Representative
of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted
to be taken by the Equityholders\' Representative under Section 2.8, Article
X or the Escrow Agreement (it being understood that the Equityholders\'
Representative shall have no right to pursue any claim on behalf of any
Company Indemnified Party in respect of the rights granted to Company
Indemnified Parties under Section 7.7). The power of attorney granted in this
Section 11.1 is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, may be delegated
by the Equityholders\' Representative and shall survive the death or
incapacity of each Equityholder. Such agency may be changed by the holders of
a majority in interest of the Indemnity Escrow Fund from time to time
(including in the event of the liquidation or dissolution of the
Equityholders\' Representative), and any such successor shall succeed
the Equityholders\' Representative as Equityholders\' Representative
hereunder. No bond shall be required of the Equityholders\' Representative,
and the Equityholders\' Representative shall receive no compensation for its
services.  (b) Limitation on Liability. The Equityholders\' Representative
shall not be liable to any Person for any act of the Equityholders\'
Representative taken in good faith and in the exercise of its reasonable
judgment and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
(it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
legal counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith and reasonable
judgment), except to the extent any liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine,
cost or expense is actually incurred by such Person as a proximate result of
the gross negligence or bad faith of the Equityholders\' Representative. The
Equityholders\' Representative shall not be liable for, and may seek
indemnification from the Equityholders for, any liability, loss, damage,
penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by the Equityholders\' Representative
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of its reasonable judgment and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent
that any such liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense is the
proximate result of the gross negligence or bad faith of the Equityholders\'
Representative. The Equityholders\' Representative shall be entitled to
recover any out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the
Equityholders\' Representative in connection with actions taken by
the Equityholders\' Representative pursuant to the terms of Section 2.8,
Article X or the Escrow Agreement (including the hiring of legal counsel and
the incurring of legal fees and costs) from the Equityholders. The
Equityholders\' Representative shall be permitted to withhold an amount equal
to $100,000 from the Merger Consideration, which amount shall be treated as
Transaction Expenses hereunder. The Equityholders\' Representative shall also
be entitled to recover from each Equityholder such Equityholder\'s ratable
share of any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by the Equityholders\' Representative arising out of or
resulting from any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Equityholders\'
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.  (c) Access.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide the Equityholders\' Representative with
reasonable access to information about the Surviving Corporation and the
reasonable assistance of the officers and employees of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation for purposes of performing his duties and exercising
his rights under this Agreement, provided, that the Equityholders\'
Representative shall treat confidentially any nonpublic information about the
Surviving Corporation (except in connection with the performance by the
Equityholders\' Representative of its duties or the exercise of its rights
under this Agreement).  (d) Actions of the Equityholders\' Representative.
From and after the Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Equityholders\' Representative shall constitute a decision of all
Equityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each
Equityholder, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Equityholders\' Representative as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of each Equityholder. Parent is
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by Parent
in accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Equityholders\' Representative.  SECTION 11.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses (including all
fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants)
incurred in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this
Agreement, the performance of the terms of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be
paid by the respective party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or
not the Closing shall have occurred.  SECTION 11.3 Costs and Attorneys\'
Fees. Subject to the limitations set forth herein, including Article X, in
the event that any action, suit or other proceeding is instituted concerning

such party\'s costs and reasonable attorneys\' fees incurred in connection
with each and every such action, suit or other proceeding, including any and
all appeals and petitions therefrom.  SECTION 11.4 Notices. All notices,

party to this Agreement shall make any public announcements in respect of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
otherwise communicate with any news media regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of the other parties to this Agreement. If a public statement is
required to be made pursuant to applicable Law or applicable stock exchange
rules and regulations, the parties shall consult with each other, to the
extent reasonably practicable, in advance as to the contents and timing
thereof.  SECTION 11.6 Interpretation. The Article and Section headings in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed
to alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement. References to Articles, Sections, Schedules or Exhibits in this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated, are references to Articles, Sections,
Schedules and Exhibits of or to this Agreement. The parties to this Agreement
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises with
respect to any term or provision of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties to this Agreement, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
to this Agreement by virtue of the authorship of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, county,
local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, (i) the
word "including" shall be deemed to be immediately followed by the words
"without limitation;" (ii) words (including defined terms) in the singular
shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa; (iii) words of one
gender shall be deemed to include the other gender as the context requires;
(iv) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereto," "herewith" and any other words
of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to
this Agreement as a whole (including all of the Schedules and Exhibits to
this Agreement) and not to any particular term or provision of this
Agreement, unless otherwise specified and (v) unless otherwise defined in
this Agreement, accounting terms shall have the respective meanings assigned
to them in accordance with GAAP consistently applied with the Company
Financial Statements.  SECTION 11.7 Severability. In the event that any one
or more of the terms or provisions contained in this Agreement or in any
other certificate, instrument or other document referred to in this
Agreement, shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or any other
such certificate, instrument or other document referred to in this Agreement,
and the parties to this Agreement shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to substitute one or more valid, legal and enforceable terms or
provisions into this Agreement which, insofar as practicable, implement the
purposes and intent of this Agreement. Any term or provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part, degree or within
certain jurisdictions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not
held invalid or unenforceable to the extent consistent with the intent of the
parties as reflected by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, each party waives any term or provision of Law which renders any term or
provision of this Agreement to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect.  SECTION 11.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the other Schedules and the Exhibits to this
Agreement) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
of the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties to this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement.  SECTION 11.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties to this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties to this Agreement, and any
purported assignment or other transfer without such consent shall be void and
unenforceable. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns.  SECTION 11.10
No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for Article II, Section 7.7 and Section
7.8, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement
and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.  SECTION
11.11 Waivers and Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified only
by a written instrument executed by all of the parties to this Agreement. Any
failure of the parties to this Agreement to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement may be waived
by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument
signed by the party granting such waiver. No delay on the part of any party
to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party to
this Agreement of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise provided, the rights and remedies
provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies which the parties to this Agreement may otherwise have at
law or in equity. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or
on behalf of a party, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner
consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in
this Section 11.11.  SECTION 11.12 Governing Law; Consent to
JurisdictionThis Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in
and to be performed entirely within such State. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
assets and properties, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State
court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting within the
State of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the agreements
delivered in connection with this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, and each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in such courts; (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware State court
or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such Federal court; (iii) waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court; and (iv) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or
Federal court. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 11.4. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.  SECTION 11.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 11.13.  SECTION 11.14 Exclusivity of Representations and
Warranties. It is the explicit intent and understanding of each of the
parties to this Agreement that no party to this Agreement, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, representatives or agents, is making any
representation or warranty whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied,
other than those set forth in this Agreement and any Ancillary Document (as
qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule), and none of the parties to
this Agreement is relying on any statement, representation or warranty, oral
or written, express or implied, made by another party to this Agreement or
such other party\'s Affiliates, representatives or agents, except for the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.  SECTION 11.15
Equitable Remedies. Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and
agrees that the other parties to this Agreement would be irreparably damaged
in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached.
Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that the other
parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and
to enforce specifically the performance by such first party under this
Agreement, and each party to this Agreement hereby agrees to waive
the defense in any such suit that the other parties to this Agreement have
an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise,
as to the propriety of injunction or specific performance as a remedy, and
hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in connection with
obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies described in this Section 11.15
shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies at law or in
equity that the parties to this Agreement may elect to pursue.  SECTION
11.16 Counterparts(a). This Agreement may be executed in one or more 
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, 
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.   (Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank)        IN
